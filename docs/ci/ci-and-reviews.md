# CI and the review gates

What runs on a pull request, what each gate is for, and how they fold into one
verdict. The source of truth is `.github/workflows/`; this doc explains the
shape and the rationale.

The `kirocrew-prepare-pr` skill
(`src/kiro_crew/builtin_skills/kirocrew-dev/kirocrew-prepare-pr/SKILL.md`) is the agent
side of this: it drives a working tree to review-ready by working with these
gates. Its phase flow, exit-code contract and PR-description contract live in
that skill, not here. Its portability design is
[../request-for-change/rfc-prepare-pr-portability.md](../request-for-change/rfc-prepare-pr-portability.md). The human release process
is [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

### Agent repair routing

For Kiro Crew PR CI AI comments, agents MUST load and execute
[kirocrew-prepare-pr's Review repair routing](../../src/kiro_crew/builtin_skills/kirocrew-dev/kirocrew-prepare-pr/SKILL.md#review-repair-routing).
That section is the one canonical contract, and its table is the only place the
repair-family preference order is written; this doc does not restate it, and
`test/test_review_repair_routing_skill.py` pins that table on purpose because it
records a requested execution policy. The reason for the policy lives in
kirocrew-prepare-pr's `references/rationale.md`.

The boundaries that matter here: the preferences are prose, not CI models, config
defaults or profile fields; the delegate implements, tests and self-reviews the
minimal fix, and the parent verifies, consolidates and publishes only with user
authorization; a missing model-pinned delegation facility is a blocker, never a
parent self-fix presented as delegation; a catalogue entry or accepted pin is not
proof of service, so an unverified served model is reported as such. The CI
workflows and the base-ref profile's read-only local reviewer semantics stay
unchanged. Worktree-dev and babysit point to this contract; general monitoring
does not depend on the Kiro Crew repository or on kirocrew-prepare-pr being installed.

## Shape

CI is a **fan-out of independent workflows that one aggregator folds into a single
verdict**, with exactly one ordering edge inside it: the cheap blocking
gates run in their own workflow, and both the expensive matrix and the fork
reviewers wait for its verdict rather than racing it.

```

Three structural facts explain most of the rest:

- **The cheap gates decide whether the expensive ones get to run.** The
  gates in `Fast Gate` cost 198 job-seconds between them, about 70% of which is
  runner acquisition and checkout, and they finish in ~44 seconds because they run
  in parallel. A median CI run is 240 job-minutes and 54 minutes of wall clock, and
  the `backend-test` shards alone are 73.7% of those job-minutes. While the
  gates lived in `ci.yml` the matrix started alongside them, so a gate that went red
  in twenty seconds still let the whole matrix run to completion. They are now a
  separate workflow with the same triggers, and `ci.yml`'s `await-fast-gate` job —
  which every heavy job needs — is the edge that makes a red gate SKIP the matrix
  instead of racing it. A `needs:` edge cannot cross a workflow file, which is why
  that barrier is a job that reads the other workflow's run rather than a
  dependency GitHub resolves for us.
- **The real merge gate is human approval plus the merge queue.** `PR Readiness`
  is the one required status: on a pull request head it aggregates every lane,
  and on a merge group it is the queue's own check (next bullet). Individual red
  checks are strong signals a human can weigh.
- **Merge queue:** every test workflow runs on `merge_group`, the tree that
  actually lands: `ci.yml`, `fast-gate.yml` and `build.yml` on the fleet with
  the diff-scoped gates diffing against the group's `merge_group.base_sha`,
  `main-ratchet-audit.yml` on the fleet judging the whole integrated tree,
  `client-py.yml` hosted, and `internal-content-scan-gate.yml`, which already
  did. `merge-queue-readiness.yml` -- a `merge_group`-only workflow whose
  single job is named `PR Readiness`, the ruleset's required check -- waits for
  those six runs on the group's commit and passes only when all six did, within
  a 120-minute budget covering `ci.yml`'s 100-minute longest chain of job caps
  plus pickup slack. The first verdict is final: a run that concludes without
  success fails the check on the tick that reads it, with no rerun and no wait
  for the lanes still running, and the job holds only `actions: read`. A rerun
  inside the queue would hold every group queued behind this one for the
  rerun's whole duration -- a CI rerun is ~40 minutes -- and two of them push a
  failing group's ejection past the point where main has moved and every group
  is rebuilt, so the failing group is never ejected and the green groups behind
  it never land. A flaky shard therefore costs the pull request a re-queue, and
  the groups behind it one rebuild; a group that fails costs them nothing. A
  failed API call is retried until the budget runs out; only a run still absent
  after the five-minute appear window, or one that concluded without success,
  fails the check. Each tick reads ONE runs listing for the
  commit, not one per workflow, every 60 s while a run may still be appearing
  and every 180 s once all six are seen: the installation token is shared by
  every workflow, and 40 queued groups then cost ~800 calls an hour instead of
  ~4,800. A rate-limited call sleeps until the limit's reset (read from
  `gh api rate_limit`, which does not count against it) plus jitter, within
  the budget. It is a separate
  file because a same-named job inside `ci.yml` behind an `if:` would still
  create a `skipped` check run on every PR head, and a skipped required check
  counts as satisfied. The AI review lanes do not run on a merge group: the
  queue re-tests the PR's already-reviewed diff on the tree it lands on, it
  does not re-review it. The two macOS legs (ci.yml's boot matrix, build.yml's
  desktop build) are the one thing a merge group does not run: a hosted mac
  runner has waited hours at this merge rate, and that wait inside the queue
  would hold every group behind it. The push-to-main path is governed by the
  repository variable `MERGE_QUEUE_ENABLED`: with it unset, a push to main runs
  the full matrix in `ci.yml` and `build.yml`; with it set to `true` -- which
  the admin does in the same operation as enabling the queue in the ruleset --
  a **push to main runs the macOS legs and little else**: `ci.yml` skips
  `changes` and `await-fast-gate` (and with them every heavy job) and boots the
  gateway on macos-15 alone; `build.yml` skips the wheel and the Windows
  installer and, after its seconds-long matrix resolver, builds and
  smoke-installs the macOS desktop package alone, per commit and never evicted,
  because the merge group proved everything else on that exact tree. Two small
  workflows still run on that push unchanged -- `main-ratchet-audit.yml`'s
  gates and `internal-content-scan-gate.yml` -- as they did before. Unsetting
  the variable together with unticking the queue restores the full push
  matrix. `fast-gate.yml` and the per-commit concurrency group follow the same
  variable: with it set, `fast-gate.yml`'s push run exists but every job skips
  (the merge group established those gates for the tree, and `ci.yml`'s
  barrier skips on that path too), and all three workflows key their push
  group on the commit SHA so the one macOS leg per landed commit is never
  evicted by the next merge. With it unset, `fast-gate.yml` runs every gate
  on the push and `ci.yml`'s barrier consumes that run, and the push keeps
  today's per-ref group -- one running plus one pending, later pushes evict
  the pending one -- so nothing on main changes until the admin sets the
  variable. Enabling the queue is a
  ruleset change (`protected-branches`, "Require merge queue"), not a workflow
  change, with `max_entries_to_build` 40, `max_entries_to_merge` 1 (one PR per
  main commit) and a status-check timeout of 180 minutes (the 150-minute poll
  plus a slow hosted pickup). The values come from a queue simulation over a
  week of real merges: one rerun removed ~90% of flaky ejections and a second
  almost all the rest; a third made the queue slower, because a real failure
  takes ~85 minutes to eject and invalidates everything queued behind it; and a
  build depth beyond ~40 did not help.
- **A fork PR is aggregated like any other and can reach a passing readiness
  state**; CodeQL is the one lane it cannot run. See [Fork PRs](#fork-prs).

Out-of-band lanes that never gate a PR:

- **Release and publish**, tag- or schedule-triggered: `release.yml`,
  `nightly.yml`, the reusable `build-wheel.yml` / `build-desktop.yml` /
  `build-windows.yml`, `sign-and-notarize.yml`, `publish-cli.yml`,
  `publish-linux.yml`, `publish-docker.yml`, `publish-installer.yml`,
  `pages.yml` (the marketing site in `site/`, path-scoped so it never runs for
  backend or dashboard changes).
- **Verification that is too slow or too expensive for a PR:** `ota-test.yml`
  builds two real app bundles and performs an actual update swap, because the
  Electron unit suite stops at the `autoUpdater` handoff and never proves a real
  bundle is replaced on disk and relaunches.
- **The ratchet verdict `main` otherwise never gets:** `main-ratchet-audit.yml`
  re-runs only the cheap ratchet, ceiling and baseline gates on every push to
  `main` and on every merge group, where it is one of the runs the queue's
  required check waits on. Two things make a push to `main` unable to answer for them in `ci.yml`:
  GitHub keeps one *pending* run per concurrency group, so on a busy `main` each
  run is evicted before its slower lanes report and a commit's checks end up
  `cancelled` rather than `failure` — which is not a red X, so `main` looks green
  while drift accumulates; and the lint lanes are surface-gated, so a
  backend-only merge *skips* the eslint ceiling outright. This lane's group is
  keyed on the SHA so no push can supersede an earlier push's audit, it runs both
  surfaces unconditionally, and it reconciles one `ratchet-audit`-labeled tracking
  issue — opened on drift, commented on each further drifting push, closed on the
  next all-green one. Because per-SHA groups let audits for different commits
  finish out of order, only a run whose commit is still `main`'s head writes to
  that shared issue: a slow green audit would otherwise close the live drift
  record a newer push just opened. An unreadable head resolves toward keeping
  drift visible in both directions — still recorded on drift, still not closed on
  green. Every gate step runs on `!cancelled()` rather than the default
  `success()`, so one drifting ratchet does not skip the rest and reduce the
  verdict to whichever gate is listed first; and the set of gate scripts is
  pinned equal to `ci.yml`'s `backend-lint`, because a gate *added* there and not
  mirrored here would never be measured on `main` at all. Two further details are
  load-bearing. It sets
  `RATCHET_SCOPE_WHOLE_TREE`, because the four diff-scoped gates
  (`scripts/ratchet_scope.py`) would otherwise resolve an EMPTY diff on a push to
  the branch they measure against and pass by judging nothing; and it *reads* the
  eslint ceiling out of `ci.yml` rather than transcribing it, because a second
  copy would keep granting the old budget after a burn-down and report green on a
  tree the PR gate reds. It deliberately does not touch `ci.yml`'s concurrency or
  add a second full run of its own: the merge queue is what runs the full suite
  on the integrated tree, and `test-durations.yml` already pays for a full suite
  on `main`.
  Contributor-facing half: [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).
- **Maintenance:** `ship-report.yml` (a scheduled Slack summary),
  `test-durations.yml` (re-measures `.test_durations`, which no sharding lane reads
  any more, and opens a PR with the update), `issue-triage.yml`
  (a model picks `type:` / `area:` / `platform:` labels from the repository's own
  live label set, because keyword rules mislabel often enough to be worse than no
  label), `issue-summary.yml` (a second, deliberately separate lane posts ONE
  comment per new issue: the report restated for a maintainer, the information
  still missing, and the recent issues most likely to be duplicates. Split from
  triage because publishing prose gives a prompt injection an audience that the
  label path does not have — so this lane, and only this lane, carries the
  markdown neutralizer and the candidate-pool intersection that stop an issue
  body from minting a `#N` reference or a mention. It gets no checkout on
  purpose; grounded, file-level investigation is Issue Radar's Investigate
  button, not a CI comment), `pr-merge-conflict-label.yml` and `fork-pr-label.yml`
  (both mirror a fact GitHub does not surface in the `/pulls` list onto a label), and
  `add-contributor.yml` (a daily cron, plus manual dispatch, adds each merged
  PR's author, the linked authors and co-authors of the commits that landed via
  a merged PR, AND the reporters of the issues those PRs closed to the README
  Contributors block via
  `scripts/update_contributors.py`; because the default branch is protected it
  opens a rolling PR rather than committing directly, like `test-durations.yml`.
  A login in `.github/contributors-optout.txt` is never added, which keeps the
  README's removal promise enforceable against the full-rebuild collector).
  Two independent paginated GraphQL sweeps drive it: one over
  `pullRequests(states: MERGED)`, reading each node's `author` and its
  `closingIssuesReferences` authors; and a separate commit-history sweep over
  the default branch, scoped to commits whose `associatedPullRequests` include a
  merged PR, reading each commit's `authors` (which resolves `Co-authored-by:`
  trailers to linked accounts). The commit sweep is kept separate rather than
  nested in the PR query because GraphQL cost scales with the product of nested
  connections, and it is scoped to merged-PR commits so it credits the same
  public-contribution boundary the author/reporter paths do — reaching an
  original author whose work was cherry-picked or co-authored into a maintainer's
  replacement PR. The reporter side is deliberately keyed on that closing link
  rather than on listing `/issues`: the connection is populated only when a PR
  declares it closes the issue, and only merged PRs are scanned, so an entry is
  evidence the report changed the product — which keeps duplicates, invalid
  reports and credit-farming issues out. It undercounts by design (a fix that
  omitted the closing keyword is invisible), and the remedy is the manual
  `--login` path, not loosening the rule. Dedup is two-layered: `sort -u` over
  the three-way union (someone can be a PR author, a merged-PR commit co-author
  and a reporter at once), then the script's own README scan. The same block also
  holds contributors whose contribution left neither trace — a review, a
  translation, a private security report — added with
  `scripts/update_contributors.py --login`. Those entries survive every later run
  because the collector only ever inserts and never rewrites an existing line;
  that preservation is what makes one shared list workable instead of a second
  table.

  Note that opening that rolling PR is best-effort. This repository leaves
  "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" off — one switch
  covers creating AND approving, and `main`'s merge gate is a required review — so
  `gh pr create` with `GITHUB_TOKEN` is refused with `GitHub Actions is not
  permitted to create or approve pull requests`. It only bites after the previous
  rolling PR merged and its branch was deleted; while the PR is open, pushing to
  the branch is enough. The push happens first either way, so a refusal is a
  handoff, not a loss: the job stays green and files/updates one issue titled
  "Add Contributor needs a human to open the contributors PR" carrying the compare
  link. The same limitation applies to every workflow here that opens a PR
  (`test-durations.yml`, `memory-benchmark.yml`), which carry the same guard in a
  lighter form: they emit a `::notice::` with the compare link and exit 0 rather
  than filing an issue, because their branches are regenerated on the next
  scheduled run and so do not need a durable tracker. Any create failure that is
  NOT that refusal still fails the job in all three.
  `test/test_workflow_pr_create_handoff.py` holds them in step and fails a new
  `gh pr create` step that skips the guard.

### Scheduled workflows: failure surfacing

A red `schedule:` run notifies nobody on its own: no pull request carries its
check and no commit author gets the e-mail, so it stays invisible until someone
opens the Actions tab. `scheduled-failure-watch.yml` is the one messenger for
every scheduled workflow that does not already file its own failure issue. It
runs on `workflow_run: completed` of each listed workflow, only when that run was
a *scheduled* one (a manual dispatch has a human watching; a `workflow_call` run
is surfaced by its caller) that ended `failure` or `timed_out` (a run that hit
its workflow-level clock is as invisible as a red one). `cancelled` is deliberately
not a trigger: `pr-merge-conflict-label.yml`, `nightly.yml` and
`memory-benchmark.yml` cancel their own in-flight scheduled run by design
(`cancel-in-progress: true`), so a cancelled scheduled run is a collapse, not a
failure, and filing on it would make every merge to `main` during a sweep a false
report. It opens
ONE issue per source workflow titled `<workflow name> scheduled run is failing`,
deduped by that fixed title compared for *equality* over the open issues
carrying its `scheduled-failure` label. The lookup reads the issues API by label
and never `--search`: the search index lags a create by minutes while two watched
workflows tick every 10 and 15, and title search is a phrase match that would let
a human-filed issue merely containing the phrase absorb the report. A repeat run
comments `Still failing (<conclusion>): <run url>`
on the open issue rather than filing a second -- at most once per 6 hours,
counting only its own bumps so a human triaging in the thread does not silence
the run links, since two watched lanes tick every 10 and 15 minutes and an
unthrottled bump would bury those links under ~144 comments a day. Closing the
issue resets the cycle on the same window: a red run within 6 hours of the close
is logged in the watcher's run, not filed, so a maintainer closing the issue
while a 10-minute lane is still red does not get a fresh issue every tick. It
holds `issues: write` and nothing else, never checks out code, and runs at most
one watcher per source workflow at a time without ever killing the one in
progress (GitHub evicts an older *pending* run when a newer one queues, which
costs nothing: the newest completion still runs after the incumbent and finds
its issue).

The rule for a new `schedule:` workflow is one line: add its `name:` to the
watcher's `workflows:` list. Three scheduled workflows are deliberately NOT
listed because each already files its own issue on failure and watching them too
would report every red run twice: `add-contributor.yml` and
`fix-loop-analysis.yml` (each carries a per-workflow "Surface failure as an
issue" step, the hand-copied ancestor of this watcher) and `gui-user-test.yml`
(its nightly report issue). `test/test_scheduled_failure_watch.py` fails when a
`schedule:` workflow is neither listed nor self-reporting, when one is both, or
when a listed name matches no workflow -- a `workflow_run` trigger on a misspelt
name never fires and never says so.

### Code ownership

`.github/CODEOWNERS` assigns every repository path to
`@kirodotdev/kirocrew-pr-review` through a single wildcard rule. GitHub reads that
file to request reviews; the file
itself establishes no approval count and enforces no branch protection, so a tier, a
required number of reviewers, or a designated-maintainer requirement cannot be
inferred from it. The wildcard rule carries the ownership declaration, and GitHub
branch protection stays the enforcement point for any required approval policy.
`fork-workflow-guard.yml` is what keeps a fork PR from editing the file (see
[Fork PRs](#fork-prs)).

## `fast-gate.yml`: the cheap blocking gates

Every job here is blocking, and nothing here is behind a path filter — the
workflow has no `changes` job at all, because a gate that costs a few seconds is
cheaper to always run than to decide about, and a filter is one more thing that can
be dodged by an edge case in its own globs.

All Fast Gate jobs select Python `3.12` through the SHA-pinned setup-python action
immediately after checkout, before any run step, on both fleet and hosted runners.
The pin selects the minor series, not one patch release. Stdlib-only gates still
need the project's supported grammar: Comment History, Loop-Bound Locks and Memory
Store Seam parse repository source, including Python 3.12 f-strings. An older
parser can reject valid source or silently miss findings. The repository-owned
kirocrew-prepare-pr profile starts its repeated checks with a pure runtime preflight that
prints the active Python version and executable and rejects versions below the
project's `>=3.12` floor. It does not install or replace an interpreter; activate a
supported environment before running the checks. Local checks do not establish
which patch release executes in CI; retain the setup action's actual runtime log.

They live in their own workflow for two reasons that both come down to who has to
wait for them. `ci.yml`'s heavy jobs now wait through `await-fast-gate`, so a red
gate skips ~220 job-minutes of tests it was previously running beside. And the
`fork-*-review.yml` lanes need SOME trusted workflow to vouch for a fork's head
commit before they start (see [Fork PRs](#fork-prs)); waiting for all of `CI` put a
fork PR's AI verdict ~54 minutes out, when the gates that verdict actually needs are
green after one.

The trigger set is copied from `ci.yml` deliberately, `branches: [main]` included.
The fork reviewers key on this workflow now, so a wider filter here would newly
review fork PRs opened against a non-main base — which today get no review at all,
because they wait on a `CI` run that `ci.yml`'s own branch filter never starts.
Widening that is a separate decision from moving the gates.

The separately required **Internal Content Scan** is not a `fast-gate.yml` job:
it needs OIDC credentials and runs through `internal-content-scan-gate.yml` for
same-repository PRs or `fork-internal-content-scan.yml` for forks. Both publish the
same check name that PR Readiness consumes; `push` to `main` remains the backstop.
See [oss-fork-boundaries](../system-specs/oss-fork-boundaries.md).

| Job | What it enforces |
|---|---|
| `vendor-manifest` | `scripts/verify_vendor_manifest.py`. Hashes every file under `src/kiro_crew/_vendor` against the committed `scripts/vendor_manifest.sha256` — the tree is excluded from semgrep and the AI reviewers' diff, so this checksum is its only content review. Hashing the ~26MB tree takes seconds, so it is always-on like the rest of this workflow |
| `brand-lint` | `scripts/check_brand_name.py`, self-test first. Fails on a newly added line that joins the two words of the product name. Diff-scoped: the tree still carries thousands of pre-convention prose lines, so a whole-tree gate would charge that backlog to whoever pushed next; the whole-tree count is still printed as a non-failing report |
| `comment-history-lint` | `scripts/check_comment_history.py`, self-test first. Fails when an added Python comment or docstring narrates change history (PR/issue ids, commit SHAs, dated incidents, review rounds, or past-tense change markers) instead of explaining current behavior. Diff-scoped; whole-tree runs report the backlog without enforcing it |
| `focus-cue-lint` | `scripts/check_focus_cue.py`, self-test first. Fails when a change writes the `className` of an element that then has no visible focus cue. Diff-scoped for the same reason as `brand-lint`, and reports whole-tree |
| `feature-map-lint` | `scripts/check_feature_map.py`, self-test first. Fails when a file is ADDED or DELETED under `website/src/pages/` or `src/kiro_crew/dashboard/handlers/`, or a `<Route>` entry arrives or leaves `website/src/App.tsx`, while `docs/feature-map/README.md` stays untouched. The blocking root AUTOSDE rule `feature-map-correctness` is the semantic half: it verifies changed rows against the code, rejects unrelated or cosmetic map churn, and checks that the map's net diff matches the PR's stated scope. Structural on purpose: an edit to an existing page changes a feature's behavior, which the map does not describe, so an edit-only diff never fires — a gate demanding a map review on every UI fix produces a map nobody reads. Fails OPEN on an unreadable diff, unlike the other gates here: this one guards a documentation habit, not an invariant a bad line carries into `main` forever |
| `changelog-history` | `scripts/check_changelog_history.py`, self-test first. Fails when a shipped `CHANGELOG.md` section loses lines. Every section already in that file describes software a user has installed, and it has been silently truncated once already — a commit titled "docs: add 0.3.0-insider.9 changelog" REPLACED the file (53 insertions, 322 deletions) and nothing noticed until the Releases page had gone nearly empty |
| `decision-ledger-history` | `scripts/check_decisions_history.py`, self-test first. Fails when a file under `docs/decisions/` other than its README is deleted, renamed or edited: each file there records a decision a person on the team made, so a change to one silently rewrites what was decided. A change of mind is a new entry naming the one it supersedes, so the only legal diff in that directory is additions. The blocking root AUTOSDE rule `recorded-decisions-are-not-regressions` is the judgment half: it blocks a change to a label, placement or behaviour an entry records unless a superseding entry quoting a maintainer arrives with it |
| `builtin-skill-scope` | `scripts/check_builtin_skill_scope.py`, self-test first. Fails on a marker for THIS repository (its GitHub slug, a `src/` checkout path, a test or workflow file) inside a skill body under `src/kiro_crew/builtin_skills/`, because those install on every machine and resolve for exactly one of them. The `kirocrew-dev/` family is exempt by directory, since this repository is its subject matter |
| `loop-bound-locks` | `scripts/check_loop_bound_locks.py`, self-test first. Fails on any module-global `asyncio.Lock()`/`Event()`/`Queue()` declaration — those bind to the import-time (or first-use) event loop and raise `RuntimeError` when acquired from another loop (Python 3.10+). #4800 converted the tree to `kiro_crew.loop_lock.LoopBoundLock`; whole-tree, since the backlog is zero |
| `testpaths-coverage` | `scripts/check_testpaths_coverage.py`, self-test first. Fails on a `test_*.py` file outside the roots `setup.cfg` pins in `testpaths` — such a file is never collected, so it is green by omission and rots against the code it claims to cover (#6577 found twelve). Whole-tree, since the backlog is zero |
| `cwd-relative-repo-reads` | `scripts/check_cwd_relative_repo_reads.py`, self-test first. Fails when a test reaches the repository through a bare relative literal: the read resolves against whatever directory the process started in, so launched from anywhere but the root it raises FileNotFoundError before a single assertion runs -- a failure that says nothing about the behaviour the test pins. Whole-tree, not diff-scoped: the backlog is zero, so there is nothing to charge to whoever pushes next. A file that changes directory itself is skipped, and a single access can carry a `# cwd-ok:` reason |
| `harness-parity` | `scripts/check_harness_parity.py`, self-test first. Fails on a newly added line that expresses "this is the Kiro harness" as the absence of another one — a shape that fails toward the permissive answer, so nothing else goes red. Diff-scoped; the whole-tree backlog is a non-failing report |
| `memory-store-seam` | `scripts/check_memory_store_seam.py`, self-test first, with `MEMSTORE_BASE_REF` resolved to the diff base. Enforces explicit store selection on added memory-context calls. The kirocrew-prepare-pr floor runs both commands; the main ratchet lane classifies this as a diff-only gate because its whole-tree backlog is a non-failing report |
| `docs-lint` | `scripts/docs_lint.py --test` then `scripts/docs-lint.sh`. Every internal link resolves, every doc is reachable from its directory index, every directory holding docs has one, no code comment cites a doc that does not exist, no doc cites a source LINE past the end of the file it names, no module spec names a source file that exists nowhere, every bare harness `H<n>` ID in a source comment names a row in `harness-parity.md`, and no doc whose filename is hardcoded in code has been renamed out from under its consumer. Four trees are walked: `docs/`, the packaged `src/kiro_crew/docs/`, `website/docs/`, and the markdown a builtin app ships under `src/kiro_crew/apps/builtins/`. Plus the fact checks below, behind a shrink-only baseline |

Each of these runs its own self-test in the same step, ahead of the real check. A
gate that has silently stopped matching reads as a green signal, which is worse than
no gate, so every rule is exercised against a planted probe first.

### `docs-lint`'s fact checks sit behind a shrink-only baseline

The structural docs checks hold at zero and fail outright. A second family inside
the same gate asks whether a sentence is still TRUE of the code, and that question
has a backlog, so its findings are `(check-id, path, token)` triples matched
against [`.github/docs-lint-baseline.txt`](../../.github/docs-lint-baseline.txt).
A listed triple passes; an unlisted one fails.

| Check | What fails |
|---|---|
| `path-exists` | A backticked repo-anchored source path (`src/**.py`, `scripts/*.py\|.sh`, `website/src/**.ts\|.tsx`, `.github/workflows/*.yml`, `docs/**/*.md`) that names no file. Written from the repo root, so it resolves or the doc is wrong — the suffix index is still a fallback, because a skill's own `scripts/` is one root down. A `path::Symbol` coordinate stays checked, since this repo addresses its own code that way too; only the docs describing a run against another repository are exempt |
| `line-ref` | A `file.py:NNN` citation anywhere in prose. The beyond-EOF check catches the citation that already rotted; this catches the one that rots on the next refactor with nothing going red. Cite a symbol name instead |
| `fenced-path` | A `docs/task-specs/**/*.md` path or a `kirocrew run` argument inside a fenced block that names no file. A fence is a sample everywhere else, but a reader PASTES these two |
| `table-row-merge` | Two index rows glued onto one physical line. Both links resolve, so every link-graph check stays green while the table renders one row short and a file loses its entry |
| `code-coupled-completeness` | A packaged doc named in a string literal under `website/src` and absent from `CODE_COUPLED_DOCS`. An unrecorded coupling can be renamed apart silently |
| `dead-identifier` | A backticked identifier absent from every first-party code tree. **Report-only** unless `--strict-identifiers`, because the class mixes real rot with names the repo cannot adjudicate |

Three checks skip a doc whose genre names things that do not exist yet
(`docs/request-for-change/`, which carries the plans, and `docs/task-specs/`):
`path-exists`, `fenced-path` and `dead-identifier`. A proposal
names a file or a symbol precisely BECAUSE it is not there yet. `fenced-path` also
skips the packaged user docs under `src/kiro_crew/docs/`, where a task-spec path is
a template for the reader's own project rather than a file in this checkout.

The builtin app tree is the mirror image of that exemption: it keeps every fact
check and every link check, and drops only the two CURATION rules, reachability and
the per-directory index. A `SKILL.md` is a skill definition an agent loads verbatim,
so a rotted path in one misroutes the agent rather than a human reader, but an index
file in `skills/<name>/` would be a file the app never loads. `UNCURATED_PREFIXES` in
`scripts/docs_lint.py` is where that line is drawn, alongside the archives.

`python3 scripts/docs_lint.py --update-baseline` prunes the list, and it is
prune-only by construction: it intersects the recorded triples with the ones firing
now, so it cannot record one, and it refuses to run when the file is missing —
read as an empty set, one `rm` plus one refresh would accept every current
violation forever. Adding is the separate `--accept-new`, which prints every triple
it records so each exemption lands in a diff a reviewer reads. That is the same
posture `check_black_formatting.py` takes.

A triple that no longer fires is **reported, not fatal**. That is a concession to
several changes consolidating the doc trees at once, so an entry graduates in a file
the current change never touched; it is not a claim that a triple is fragile, since
the recorded identity omits the line number and a reflow keeps it.

## `ci.yml`: correctness

Every job here is blocking. Every job that costs real runner time also `needs:`
`await-fast-gate`, so on a red gate it does not run at all.

| Job | What it enforces |
|---|---|
| `changes` | "Detect changed surface". Resolves the path filters every other job reads, so a diff that cannot affect a surface does not pay for it |
| `await-fast-gate` | Polls the `Fast Gate` run for this exact head commit and **fails closed** in all three ways it can go wrong: a run that never appears (180s budget), one that never completes (720s budget), and one whose conclusion is a decided non-success. `action_required` is not one of them: GitHub reports a fork run still awaiting maintainer approval as `completed`/`action_required`, so the barrier polls it as pending under the 720s budget rather than letting approval order decide whether the matrix runs. A barrier that passed when it could not read its subject would be worse than none, because the matrix would run anyway and the log would claim it was cleared to. One extra ~1-minute job buys the whole matrix the right to not start |
| `backend-lint` | `isort --check-only`, `flake8`, `mypy` on Python 3.12, plus `scripts/check_black_formatting.py` — black enforced on every file outside `.github/black-baseline.txt`, which can only shrink — and `scripts/check_subprocess_encoding.py` (self-test first) — no text-mode subprocess call without an explicit `encoding=`, `**UTF8_TEXT`, or a `# subprocess-encoding: locale` marker, outside `.github/subprocess-encoding-baseline.txt`, which can only shrink — and `scripts/check_sync_io_in_async.py` (self-test first) — no blocking db / subprocess / http / `time.sleep` call inside an `async def` under `src/`, outside `.github/sync-io-in-async-baseline.txt`, which can only shrink. A stall past `dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs` (25s) makes the watchdog kill the gateway and drop every in-flight turn (#3057, #1572); the escape is an offload (`await asyncio.to_thread(...)`, or a named lane from `src/kiro_crew/executors.py`) or a `# on-loop-io-ok: <why it cannot block>` marker whose reason is mandatory. All four baselined gates in this job read their diff scope from the one shared resolver in `scripts/ratchet_scope.py`, so they cannot disagree about which lines a change added; the env-base gates (`check_brand_name.py`, `check_harness_parity.py`, `check_focus_cue.py`) share the same diff parsing through its explicit-base entry points while keeping their `*_BASE_REF` base semantics |
| `backend-test` | 8 whole-file shards on Python 3.12, assigned before import, `-n auto` within each; 60-minute job budget includes coverage upload, with the 120-second per-test timeout retained. Large CodeBuild compute with the non-root boundary for eligible actors; hosted fallback |
| `backend-test-windows` | All 8 whole-file shards use large CodeBuild compute for eligible actors, windows-latest otherwise; `--no-cov`, 180s per-test timeout. See the migration contract below |
| `backend-test-ipv6` | Five native IPv6 cases on hosted Linux and Windows; fail-closed report check, Linux full-run coverage merged with the ordinary shards |
| `backend-test-kernel-lock-owner` | Runs the two strict live-holder/orphan flock cases on uncontainerized `ubuntu-latest` with `KIROCREW_LOCK_OWNER_STRICT=1`; full-scope coverage is merged with the shard and IPv6 artifacts |
| `pod-boot-windows` | Boots a real worktree Pod under Windows Task Scheduler and pins three canary tests. A PR carrying `ci:pod-scenarios` before its next push also runs the 55-test Pod scenario suite against a built SPA |
| `backend-test-windows-fail-closed` | Same actor-gated Windows routing, single `-n0` run of `test/test_windows_fail_closed_optin.py` BY NODE ID with the pass count grepped, so a silent skip cannot go green. It boots a real gateway and drives one ACP prompt turn on Windows against real filesystem state |
| `backend-test-sandbox` | The one job that clears the AppArmor userns restriction, so the tests guarded by `skipif(not userns_available())` EXECUTE instead of skipping. Runs all eleven sandbox-dependent suites. The shards collect the same files — nothing is deselected — but there the sandbox-guarded tests skip, so this is the only lane where those assertions (the `~/.kiro/crew` keystone among them) actually execute |
| `backend-test-crew-container` | "Backend Tests (crew container)". The only lane that runs the crew container image's suite (`aws_control/crew/runtime/container_tests/`). It is separate from the shards because it installs the image's own runtime pins (`container/requirements.txt`: fastapi, uvicorn, httpx, boto3), which that file's header forbids becoming dependencies of the application, and the shards' environment IS the application's, so there the suite's conftest collects nothing. Sets `CREW_CONTAINER_TESTS_REQUIRED=1`, which turns every reason that conftest would decline to collect into a hard error and checks the collection against the tree: every module and every named test the source declares must yield an item, and the total must be at or above `_MIN_COLLECTED` and no more than `_FLOOR_MARGIN` above it. A declared module or test name that stops yielding an item reds on its own name, with no number involved; the count is what catches a test whose parametrize cases drain while its name is still collected. `_MIN_COLLECTED`'s own comment states what that does and does not catch, and is the only place that bound is spelled out |
| `real-adapter-contract` | "Real Adapter Contract Tests". The one lane that INSTALLS the adapters the codex and opencode projections were measured against — `@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp` and `opencode-ai`, `npm ci` from the locked manifest in `test/real_adapters/` (its own manifest, not the product's; Dependabot bumps it weekly so drift shows up in the bump PR) — so the four contract tests that drive a real adapter execute instead of skipping. Everywhere else they skip, which left the element shape, the child environment, the refused transports and the eviction verb resting on one local run. Selects them by the `real_adapter` marker, so one added later is included rather than left out of a list. Sets `KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE=1` — the repository's existing "this job declared its preconditions must hold" switch, shared with the E2E suites — which turns an absent adapter into a failure, and then asserts on the junit report that at least the known contracts ran and none was skipped, so a broken install cannot report a green lane that measured nothing |
| `coverage-combine` then `coverage-gate` | Combines the 3.12 shard data, then enforces the project line-rate floors, plus a per-file floor with a shrink-only baseline (all floors live in the job's `env:` block). **CodeBuild-hosted runner** (pilot, below) except for forks |
| `frontend-lint` | `tsc -p tsconfig.app.json`, `eslint` under a hard-zero warning ceiling, `jscpd`, and `npm run i18n:check` |
| `electron-test` | The Electron shell's own node:test suite (`website/electron`) |
| `electron-test-windows` | Runs the native Windows port-owner identity tests against real NTFS junction and `Win32_Process` behavior; no npm install is needed because the tested modules use Node's standard library only |
| `frontend-test` | `vitest run --coverage`. **CodeBuild-hosted runner, `instance-size:large`** (pilot, below) except for forks |
| `frontend-coverage-merge` | Merges the frontend coverage shards so the gate reads one report. **CodeBuild-hosted runner** (pilot, below) except for forks |
| `cfn-lint` | Lints the artifact-deploy templates with a pinned `cfn-lint`. **Runs on the CodeBuild-hosted runner** (pilot, below) except for fork PRs |
| `linux-packaging` | "Linux Packaging (build + smoke-install)". Builds all three Linux desktop formats from one backend tree through `packaging/build-desktop.sh`, then installs them in their target distros with `scripts/smoke-linux-packages.sh`. Path-filtered on the packaging surface |
| `lockfile-engines-floor` | "Lockfile Installs On Declared Node Floor". Runs a real `npm ci` in `website/` on the LOWEST Node version `engines.node` declares, so a lockfile that only resolves under the newer npm major cannot land. The version is a literal pinned to that floor by `test_the_engines_floor_job_pins_the_declared_floor` rather than a range, because resolving a range picks the newest match and makes the job vacuous |
| `bundle-size` | "Bundle Size Gate". Builds the frontend with `--mode analyze` (which is the only build that emits `dist/bundle-report.json`) and then runs TWO checks over that one build: per-chunk ceilings from `website/scripts/check-bundle-size.mjs`, with a 500 KB default for any chunk not named there, and an acyclic-graph check from `website/scripts/check-chunk-cycles.mjs`. The job name is narrower than its scope on purpose — it is a required check, so renaming it would silently stop satisfying branch protection. **An acyclic chunk graph is a deliberate invariant and the cycle check has no allowlist**, unlike the size ceilings: a chunk cycle has no valid initialization order, so a body can run against a binding that is still uninitialized and blank the page before React mounts, and whether a given cycle does that is not decidable from the chunk graph. Fix the chunking rather than waiving it. Skipped on a backend-only diff, which cannot change the bundle |
| `e2e` | Runs `python scripts/ci_e2e_parallel.py`, which awaits `python setup.py test_e2e`, the dedicated Memory UI pytest command, and `npm --prefix website run i18n:render` in parallel. **CodeBuild-hosted large runner where eligible**, behind the same `run-as-runner` boundary as the backend shards. The suite's disposable gateway takes `agent.sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec` (seeded in `test/test_playwright_e2e.py`) because the fleet container refuses `CLONE_NEWUSER` at the runtime policy level and the agent binary is a stdlib echo stub; a sandboxed spawn doing real work stays proven by `e2e-private-namespace` and `e2e-boot-matrix`. Details: [e2e-gate.md](e2e-gate.md) |
| `e2e-private-namespace` | "E2E (private member namespace, hosted)". The one E2E step the fleet cannot host: `test/e2e/test_private_workflow_memory.py` runs a Crew Member's private workflow MCP inside the member sandbox, which needs `unshare --map-root-user`. Hosted `ubuntu-latest`, clears the AppArmor userns restriction first, no SPA or browser |
| `integration` | "Integration (in-process gateway)". The middle layer: `test/integration/` boots the real `GatewayOrchestrator.run()` inside the pytest process on a scratch `KIROCREW_HOME` with the packaged fake ACP backend and talks HTTP to the port it bound, so one test can assert across a restart, across two concurrent requests on one event loop, or on a file the boot itself wrote. Opt-in by `KIROCREW_INTEGRATION=1`, so the unit shards collect and skip it; Linux only. Gated on ROUTE coverage -- `scripts/check_integration_route_coverage.py` reports the share of registered dashboard routes the suite requested (`--min` is a ratchet kept a little under what `main` measures) and the report is uploaded as the `integration-route-coverage` artifact. Details: `docs/system-specs/common/testing-conventions.md`, "The integration layer" |
| `e2e-boot-matrix` | Boots a real fake-backed gateway and pins seven tests on Linux and Windows for PRs; push-to-main runs add `macos-15`. Every leg is fail-closed on missing prerequisites or a collapsed pass count |

`backend-lint` also runs `scripts/check_python_audit.py` (report-only findings,
fail-closed execution), `scripts/check_acp_frame_host_data.py`,
`scripts/check_agent_sdk_boundary.py`, and
`scripts/check_lockdown_before_publish.py`. The Agent SDK boundary check is the
fourth shrink-only, diff-scoped baseline gate referenced in the table above.

### Backend file sharding

The Linux, Windows and macOS matrices assign whole files before pytest imports
their items. `scripts/ci_file_shards.py` is an opt-in pytest plugin, loaded only by
those matrix commands. It uses SHA-256 of the root-relative POSIX path to choose
one of `SHARD_COUNT` owners. Each xdist worker reaches the same assignment.
Adding a file does not move existing files between shards.

Pytest still walks its configured roots, applies its filename patterns and
platform-specific conftest ignores, and creates its normal file collectors.
The plugin returns an empty collection report for files owned by another shard,
before their collector imports them. It does not rewrite discovery into explicit
file arguments, which would bypass `collect_ignore`. Within its owner, the
ordinary Linux shard excludes only `ipv6_required` and the dedicated hosted lane runs
those items; the macOS command passes no marker filter at all. Explicit reduced-scope targets keep their
existing discovery semantics and are partitioned at the same file boundary.
Leaf-test repeat runs do not load the file-sharding plugin and remain unsharded.

Both Linux and Windows backend commands opt into the existing payload-free
`scripts.ci_pytest_progress` recorder. Linux supplies it to full, reduced and leaf
invocations through a shell argument array, not inherited `PYTEST_ADDOPTS`.
A crashed worker is not restarted (`--max-worker-restart=0`): the shard stays
failed and may end before all selected tests finish, rather than losing its
failure report during replacement. This is fail-fast diagnosis, not successful
coverage or a repair of the crashing test. Periodic console records and best-effort
JSONL artifacts preserve evidence; job-level cancellation can prevent uploads.
Healthy selection, per-test timeouts and coverage selectors are unchanged.

The root conftest's import-time telemetry guard fails the offending module's
collection report on every worker, so pytest/xdist fails the job even when the
shard does not own `test_host_isolation_floor.py`. The process-wide telemetry-off
pin, per-module emitter attribution and recorder reset remain in force; a test
on one shard is not the enforcement point for other shards' collection state.

The union of the ordinary shards and hosted IPv6 lane must equal the original
suite, with no duplicates within each OS. Invalid shard options fail as usage
errors. A shard collecting no tests retains
pytest's nonzero exit; it never falls back to the whole suite or reports success.
`loadgroup` still serializes marked tests within a job. Like the former item
split, this is not a cross-runner serialization mechanism. Namespace jobs keep their
own collection, and macOS now file-shards like the two backend jobs, so no job
splits items any more. `pytest-split` stays
installed for `test-durations.yml`'s `--store-durations` recording run and for three
tests that load its plugin directly (`test_ci_pytest_progress.py`,
`test_ci_file_shards.py`, `test_xdist_escaped_failure_guard.py`); what has no consumer
is the `.test_durations` those runs record.

This reduces repeated test-module imports and item collection. It does not avoid
shared conftest/package imports or imports made by another test. Hashing does not
balance duration, and one large test file is indivisible. The eight Linux/Windows
shards, and macOS's four, trade more runner slots and repeated setup for less work per
shard. Keep runner
routing, timeout values and coverage gates fixed when comparing CI runs; report
the shard count alongside queue, collection and execution timings.
Use actual phase timing rather than buffered log timestamps to measure collection.
Full-suite throughput and the five-minute goal require remote evidence, not an
extrapolation from shard count. Full-run coverage combines ordinary shards with
the required hosted IPv6 artifact.

The Linux coverage command retains the `kiro_crew` and `sage_lib` package-name
boundary. It additionally selects only the AWS Control crew packaging directory
and the Sage tests directory: both contain source already included in that
boundary's reports, but synthetic builder module names and app-local fixture
imports can otherwise lose executed lines depending on import order. Selecting
all of `src/kiro_crew` instead also admits vendored libraries, standalone skill
scripts and container code outside the package-name boundary. No new exclusions
or baseline entries are needed; omit rules, branch measurement and floors stay
unchanged. Sage's path alias remains in place. Combined data can contain both
native separators and POSIX remapped keys: comparisons normalize separators,
while coverage queries use the exact recorded key and reject duplicate identities.

The coverage regression checks nonzero expected lines and equal branch arcs for
an unsharded run and four file shards, including exec variants and both Sage
import spellings. It stages each shard's data outside the active `.coverage.*`
glob, which pytest-cov erases at the next run's start. Variants compiled with the
original filename contribute to that file's coverage; this is not proof that each
recorded line ran in the unmodified variant. Whole-suite coverage and baseline
graduations still require the resulting CI artifact.

Rollback: replace the plugin and `--file-shards` / `--file-shard` flags in the
four matrix invocations with the previous `--splits` / `--group` flags. No
infrastructure, worker-count or privilege change is needed.

### Required native IPv6 tests

`ipv6_required` marks only tests whose native loopback contract needs `::1`.
The ordinary Linux and Windows shards exclude this marker in every invocation,
including hosted fallback, frontend-only scope and leaf gates/repeats. The
`backend-test-ipv6` matrix runs the marked population on `ubuntu-latest` and
`windows-latest`. No fleet network or privilege setting changes. Local pytest
has no default marker filter; macOS keeps its existing hosted selection.

Five nodes are routed: the three real DNS-rebinding tests in
`TestDnsRebindingIsRefused`, only the IPv6 parameter of
`test_native_tcp_peer_identifies_client_process_not_server`, and
`TestFindListeningPidsErrors.test_windows_finds_real_ipv6_loopback_listener`.
The IPv4 peer parameter, stable-host and off-event-loop DNS tests, and mocked
IPv6 tests stay in the ordinary shards. The listener test keeps its Windows-only
platform guard. Native bind failures remain hard failures, not capability skips.

The hosted lane asserts exactly five reported cases, with only the Windows-only
listener allowed to skip on Linux. It always runs this bounded population, even
on frontend-only diffs, and repeats it three times on leaf-test diffs. Ordinary
leaf corpus gates still run once. The collection contract compares actual pytest
nodes before routing with the disjoint ordinary-plus-hosted union and verifies
the affected files' shard owners.

Full-run Linux IPv6 coverage uses exactly the ordinary shards' two package names
and two bounded directory selectors. Windows remains trace-free. Frontend-only
and leaf runs remain coverage-free. Coverage Combine needs both test lanes and
explicitly downloads `coverage-ipv6`, separate from `coverage-shard-*`; it refuses
a missing `.coverage.ipv6` before combining. Coverage Gate always requires the
IPv6 matrix to succeed, including reduced and leaf runs. Failed, skipped or
cancelled upstream jobs cannot silently satisfy the gate. Floors, baselines,
omit rules and measured source boundaries stay unchanged. Local node and coverage
union tests do not establish hosted OS execution or remote artifact delivery.

### Linux and Windows CodeBuild migration

All eight `backend-test` shards use `linux_runner_large`; all eight
`backend-test-windows` shards and `backend-test-windows-fail-closed` use the
centrally resolved large Windows label. `e2e-boot-matrix` maps its Linux and
Windows legs to those outputs without changing `matrix.os`, names, timeouts or
artifact names. `backend-lint` uses large on the fleet. The formatter gate runs
`scripts/bounded_black.py` on every runner -- fleet, GitHub-hosted and local --
with at most eight workers regardless of the native pool size; the CI step does
not set `BLACK_NUM_WORKERS`. Hosted runners originally kept Black's native CLI and
default pool, and every fork PR's lint job then died mid-step with exit 143 after
6-9 minutes ([#13689](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/issues/13689)):
`ubuntu-latest` installs the compiled Black wheel, whose per-worker retention is
the same failure the fleet measured, and the hosted VM has no cgroup cap
(`memory.max: max`, 16 GB host), so the runner itself was torn down instead of a
worker being OOM-killed. Recycling costs about 1.6x native wall time on four
cores; more workers than cores do not shorten it. `scripts/ci_black_diagnostics.py` runs the gate
once, preserves its failure status and stderr, and records bounded cgroup readings
and child peak RSS. Worker count alone does not bound retained formatting trees:
[the env-only two-worker fleet run](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/actions/runs/35417525930/job/105829161045)
reached its 15,032,385,536-byte cgroup limit and incremented `oom_kill` from zero
to one before the recycling wrapper existed. Retirement after one file is what
bounds retention, so a worker's own peak does not grow with the pool and the
ceiling is set for wall time rather than for that accumulation.

The wrapper adapts the pinned native Black CLI to one file per spawned worker.
Native discovery, configuration, exclusions, caches and AST checks remain intact.
On Linux its launcher and workers have a 2 GiB per-process address-space ceiling;
local macOS and Windows retain recycling without that Linux-only ceiling. Incomplete
reports, cancellation, worker failures and launcher exceptions return 123, never
a partial formatting verdict. Per-process limits do not bound the whole job's
cgroup usage or guarantee that every future input fits. The repository-owned
kirocrew-prepare-pr profile keeps the bounded local path and diagnostic command. Ratchet
scope, graduates and prune-only baseline refresh remain unchanged.
`bundle-size` uses large for its 6 GiB heap.
Shard ownership, coverage selectors and floors stay unchanged. Five stale Windows
expected-failure entries are removed only after their six Bash syntax cases pass;
syntax checks select native Git Bash on Windows and Bash on POSIX. Recency tests
control module-local clocks, and purge tests evaluate real activity against an
explicit clock without relaxing future-time or retention refusals. Device-name
refusals check actual directory entries and write attempts, not `CON.exists()`.
Cache tests control both directory and file mtimes and retain real mutation checks.
These test preconditions do not promise production ordering under tied clocks.
Test commands route only `ipv6_required` items to the hosted lane described above.
This is one migration being validated, not eight already-proven shards
or a rollout conditional on three green canaries.

The CI workflow requires this repository, a push, a merge-group event or an
`opened`/`synchronize` same-repository PR event, and
`contains(fromJSON(vars.CODEBUILD_ACTOR_IDS || '[]'), github.actor_id)`.
A `merge_group` run's actor is the person who queued the pull request, so the
same list admits it without a new entry.
Other PR activities (including edits, reopens and labels) stay hosted even for
an admitted actor: that actor did not supply the code being run. The same
restriction applies to every inline PR route and both platform resolvers.
The same actor check covers the existing inline routes, including every
unconditional Fast Gate. Pages and the main ratchet audit also admit manual
runs from listed actors. The three non-agentic code-review checks use the PR
route; the merge-conflict label job and the reusable wheel/dependency-audit
jobs use the fleet only for push events, keeping scheduled/manual callers hosted.
Their steps, permissions and triggers are unchanged.

The repository variable is a JSON array of string actor IDs matching the fleet
webhook filter. The maintainer changing either fleet project's actor filter owns
updating `CODEBUILD_ACTOR_IDS` in the same operational change and verifying that
both projects and the routing mirror agree before declaring that change complete.
Missing/empty membership routes to hosted; a fork PR stays
hosted even when its actor is admitted. A merge group is different in kind
from a pull request and is routed like a push: by ruleset construction it holds
only a head that a maintainer approved at that exact commit (the queue admits
nothing that fails the `protected-branches` rules), it cannot be amended once
queued, and it is the very tree that lands on `main` -- where the push run
executes it on the fleet -- minutes later. The fork fence exists for code
nobody has approved; a merge group cannot carry any. The people who can queue
a fork's code (maintainers, who can also push it to `main` directly) are the
same people the fleet already trusts. Every output consumer has a hosted
fallback. Removing the variable routes all these jobs back to hosted on new
runs, without changing tests or AWS resources. It does not reroute an already
queued job. The independent webhook filter remains necessary: routing is not a
credential boundary against a contributor who edits a workflow.

The existing projects were reported verified with Linux `standard:7.0` and
Windows `windows-base:2022-1.0`, MEDIUM defaults, no project environment
variables, privileged mode off, no reserved fleet, and matching actor filters.
The Windows label adds only `instance-size:large`; it invents no image override.
These manually managed resources still need reproducible infrastructure source;
this repository change grants no AWS permissions and provisions no resources.

Linux setup actions retain the runner identity. `run-as-runner` then hands only
the workspace to the test user and supplies jq 1.7.1, lsof and toolcache libpython
resolution. The root-owned runner temp is sticky 1777, never recursively chowned;
file-command files remain unwritable by the test user. Tests and shard coverage
staging use ci-shell; scope selection keeps the default shell because it writes
`GITHUB_OUTPUT`. Hosted uses a bash passthrough. The boot matrix selects its
shell in job-level `defaults.run` from `matrix.os`; step-level shells are literal.
Dependency installation explicitly uses bash under the runner identity before
ci-shell is provisioned. Before Bash starts, the CodeBuild boundary resets only
inherited SIGINT ignore state; UID/EUID and other signal dispositions are unchanged.
It verifies the existing `/dev/shm` is tmpfs and designates it only for the two
kernel-owner lock tests. Those fixtures create private temporary homes and remove
them afterward; ordinary tests retain their normal temporary directories. No mount,
permission or file-command ownership is changed. Overlay inode mismatch was measured;
tmpfs fixes that identity mismatch but does not guarantee dead-acquirer visibility.
The ordinary orphan test observes the live acquirer before releasing and reaping it,
then independently verifies continued flock contention and complete inode-matched
kernel records. Only a positively observed blank/owner-0 record with no named-owner
record permits the existing honest unknown-owner refusal. Read errors and conflicting
records fail; a production lookup returning `None` alone never selects that branch.

The permanent hosted exception `backend-test-kernel-lock-owner` runs the same live-
holder and orphan cases on an uncontainerized `ubuntu-latest` runner, with no designated
lock root and `KIROCREW_LOCK_OWNER_STRICT=1`. It requires the exact dead acquirer, rejects
environmental returns, and validates both JUnit identities with zero skips or failures.
The ordinary fleet still runs both cases. Full-scope coverage uses the same four
selectors, uploads `coverage-kernel-lock-owner`, and requires
`.coverage.kernel-lock-owner` before combining alongside the shards and IPv6 data.
Coverage Gate requires the strict lane's success in full, reduced and leaf scopes;
missing artifacts or failed, cancelled or skipped execution cannot satisfy it.
Native hosted and fleet success must still be established by actual CI logs.

The boot matrix uses the same
boundary on Linux, where its rich fixture asserts a named namespace refusal
when the real backend is unavailable rather than skipping the test.

Windows checkout is followed by a CodeBuild-only inventory using system
PowerShell, before setup-python/setup-uv and default-pwsh run steps. It reports
installed shells/tools, memory and selected paths, verifies installed pwsh and
native Git Bash (not the System32 WSL launcher). Bash receives only the command
token `uname`; PowerShell requires a successful exit and exactly one native
MINGW/MSYS result. This avoids both nested argument quoting and a BOM prefixed
to a stdin script. The composite then
uses the repository-pinned setup-node action to provide Node 24 on CodeBuild only.
The measured image's Node 20 was below the required floor.
After dependency setup, hard probes require Python 3.12, Git, uv, jq and Node
at the supported floor, exact token-user file ownership, owner-only ACL
application, file symlinks, rename and cleanup under workspace and runner temp.
Owner errors include both SIDs. gh is not required because backend tests stub
its calls. Probes touch only disposable files and log no environment dump or
credentials. Hosted setup and test behavior is unchanged.

The reusable Linux boundary has one eight-way shard measurement:
[run 35374412954, job 105696454897](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/actions/runs/35374412954/job/105696454897)
reports 12,998 passed, 42 skipped and 5 xfailed in 473.89 seconds. It does not prove
all eight shards, Windows image capabilities, Black with the new worker cap, or
service cleanup. Retain each newly executed job's log/progress artifact, compare
counts against its hosted population, verify coverage combine/gate, and confirm
build termination and runner deregistration. Linux local tests cannot establish
native Windows or CodeBuild lifecycle facts. Task Scheduler pod boot, interactive
installer, namespace E2E/sandbox, release and GUI jobs remain outside this migration
pending real container proof or infrastructure approval.

Neither CodeBuild image ships a runner tool cache, so every `setup-node` step
there resolved its bare major through `actions/node-versions`' manifest -- one
authenticated `api.github.com` call per step, per run, against the same
`GITHUB_TOKEN` hourly budget the fleet's other calls share. The composite
`.github/actions/seed-node-tool-cache` runs before each `setup-node` on a
CodeBuild-routed job (and inside `setup-windows-tests`): on
`runner.environment == 'self-hosted'` it reads the newest release of the major
from nodejs.org's `index.json`, verifies the tarball against nodejs.org's
`SHASUMS256.txt`, and unpacks it into `RUNNER_TOOL_CACHE/node/<version>/<arch>`
with the `<arch>.complete` marker `@actions/tool-cache` looks for. `setup-node`
checks that directory before the manifest, so its log then reads `Found in
cache @ ...` instead of `Attempting to download 24...`. On GitHub-hosted
runners the composite does nothing. It changes no pin: the version input must
match the following `setup-node` step, and `test_node_version_pins.py` still
governs the `setup-node` pins themselves.

Rollback needs no AWS change: set Linux resolver outputs to `ubuntu-latest` and
Windows to `windows-latest`, and return the two direct routes (`changes` and
`await-fast-gate`) to hosted; an individual consumer can instead use its hosted
label. Boot-matrix rollback restores `runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}`. Keep the test
arguments and coverage unchanged. A rejected webhook leaves a job queued before
its timeout starts; diagnose or roll back rather than raising that timeout.

### macOS is not a pull-request gate any more

The macOS pytest lane ran in this table until the queue was measured. On three
consecutive green PR runs (34866269260, 34864945056, 34863753125) the macOS jobs
waited **176, 190 and 213 minutes** for a `macos-15` runner and then ran for 26-33.
Everything non-macOS finished at 78-98 minutes while the runs took 248-268, so ~64%
of a pull request's CI wall clock was macOS queue time — and since `PR Readiness`
is triggered by `workflow_run` on `ci.yml`'s completion, that queue sat on the merge
button. In the same window the lane failed 0 times and was **cancelled 129 times**,
usually still queued when a newer push superseded the run. Linux escapes this
because `changes` routes it to the CodeBuild runners; there is no self-hosted macOS
pool, so the queue is not tunable here.

Where the coverage went:

| Lane | Where | Blocking? |
|---|---|---|
| `backend-test-macos` (full suite, 4 shards) | `platform-tests.yml`: called by `nightly.yml` at 06:00 UTC, plus `workflow_dispatch` against any branch | Holds the nightly **publish** jobs, never the builds — the artifacts are the evidence a fixer works from. Maintains one tracking issue (`platform-tests-macos` label) carrying the failing node ids and the pull requests merged in the last 24h |
| The same suite, on demand | `macos-on-demand.yml`, `pull_request`, calls `platform-tests.yml` against the PR head; a Linux `decide` job runs it when the diff touches a darwin-sensitive path, **or** the PR carries the `ci:macos` label, **or** the head SHA falls in a 1-in-20 sample (`16#${HEAD_SHA:0:8} % 20`, deterministic per commit) (acts immediately -- the workflow listens for `labeled`). Over those three sits a CEILING: the path and sample switches are refused while this lane already holds `LANE_MAX_LIVE_RUNS` (4) live runs of the hosted macOS pool (a run holds one job per shard, so the ceiling is expressed in runs but felt in jobs, and it moves with the shard count), because on 2026-09-24 it held 53 of the 56 in-progress macOS jobs and one shard waited 14 hours for a runner while `build.yml` and `release.yml` queued behind it. A capped run is skipped, not queued, so the ceiling bounds demand and settles the lane at about six verdicts an hour -- a timely verdict for a few pull requests instead of a 14-hour one for all of them, with the nightly still covering every merge. The `ci:macos` label is never refused, and neither is a re-run, so a retry cannot turn a red lane into a skip | Advisory. It is a separate workflow ON PURPOSE: a macOS job inside `ci.yml` holds that workflow's completion even with `continue-on-error`, so it would still hold readiness. Readiness evaluates neither this workflow nor its check |
| Real gateway boot on macOS | `ci.yml`'s `e2e-boot-matrix`, the only job on the push-to-main path; `nightly.yml`'s `pod-scenarios` | Blocking on main / holds nothing in the nightly |

`test/test_macos_platform_tests_gate.py` pins all of it, including the property that
nothing on the required `pull_request` path may instantiate a macOS runner.
The on-demand Darwin path list includes the shared hooks, pinned filesystem
primitives, outbox handlers, descriptor regression suite and theme-install suite.
Changes to any of them select the native macOS suite on each push without
requiring a label or a sample hit. The lane remains advisory; a Linux simulation
is not evidence of native APFS behavior.

The native contracts in `test/test_darwin_native_provider_reap.py` and their
`session_pid`, `session_lifecycle`, `session_cleanup`, and `session_pool` callers
are explicit on-demand paths. They exercise real Darwin process identities,
zombie-root reaping, reaped-root group recovery, escaped descendants, and three
rounds each of idle expiry, pool-health TTL and claim-time TTL cleanup. Only the
provider protocol and clock are simulated; every process belongs to the test,
and fixture cleanup is independent of the production reaper. These are native
regression tests, not a live-gateway soak or a before/after memory measurement.

Details worth knowing:

- **CodeBuild-hosted runner (pilot).** `cfn-lint` is the first job whose
  `runs-on` is not a GitHub-hosted label but
  `codebuild-kirocrew-gha-linux-${{ github.run_id }}-${{ github.run_attempt }}`:
  an AWS CodeBuild project subscribed to this repository's `workflow_job` webhook
  starts one ephemeral self-hosted runner per queued job, runs that single job,
  and terminates. Why: at peak the repository's `ubuntu-latest` queue holds a
  30-second job for 13 minutes (measured 2026-09-11 on this job: mean queue 155 s,
  max 788 s, 6 of 29 runs over five minutes), and the repository is ~99% of the
  org's Actions consumption, so the wait is a fair-use ceiling no workflow change
  can lift. Reproducible source for the deployed runner infrastructure remains
  follow-up work; this public repository only selects existing projects.
  **Second wave:** `frontend-test` (4 shards), `frontend-coverage-merge`,
  `coverage-combine` and `coverage-gate` are routed the same way. The frontend
  shards add an `instance-size:large` label suffix (8 vCPU / 15 GB, the hosted
  runner's memory class; the default CodeBuild size has 7 GB) because `vitest
  --coverage` is memory-bound; the merge and the two Python coverage jobs use
  the project default. One thing the runner changes for the merge: every
  CodeBuild build has its own workspace root (`/codebuild/output/src<random>/…`),
  and a vitest blob stores paths absolute, so the four shards' blobs arrive with
  four different roots and `--merge-reports --coverage` unions nothing (each
  file reported four times, non-zero exit, no failing test named — the pilot's
  first two runs). `frontend-coverage-merge` therefore rewrites each blob's
  root to its own checkout before merging
  (`.github/scripts/frontend-blob-normalize-paths.mjs`); on hosted runners the
  roots already match and the step is a no-op. The Python side has the same
  seam — the `backend-test` shards (hosted) record coverage under
  `/home/runner/work/…` and `coverage-combine` (CodeBuild) runs under another
  root — closed at the source instead: `[coverage:run] relative_files = true`
  in `setup.cfg`, so shard data files carry repo-relative paths and combine
  wherever the repo is checked out. A third effect of that root: vitest matches
  `coverage.include` against the absolute path with picomatch `contains`, so
  `src/**` is satisfied by the `/src/actions-runner/` segment of every
  CodeBuild checkout and non-`src/` files loaded by tests (integration mocks,
  `scripts/`) gained coverage numbers of their own, which the per-file gate
  failed. `website/vite.config.ts` now excludes every non-`src/` directory of
  `website/` by name, anchored on `website/`, which is a no-op on hosted paths.
  **Backend shards also use large compute**, with the in-job non-root boundary
  described in [Linux and Windows CodeBuild migration](#linux-and-windows-codebuild-migration).
  `test/test_ci_fleet_routing_expression_parity.py` pins each complete resolver
  consumer expression, including its hosted fallback and OS mapping.
  Root semantics and the measured jq/lsof/libpython gaps are handled there;
  namespace enforcement jobs still require their hosted kernel capabilities.
  Peak-hour measurement behind the move (2026-09-11, 38 runs):
  backend shards queued p90 521 s / max 763 s, frontend shards p90 569 s / max
  813 s, with 103 of these jobs running at once. Things to know when touching it:
  - **Forks never see it.** The label is computed once, in the `changes` job
    (outputs `linux_runner` and `linux_runner_large`), and the routed jobs read
    it as `runs-on: ${{ needs.changes.outputs.linux_runner || 'ubuntu-latest' }}`,
    so there is one copy of the decision rather than one per job, and a job
    that runs after `changes` failed (`coverage-gate` fails closed with
    `if: always()`) still gets a runner instead of erroring out before its own
    checks execute: a run in any
    repository other than `kirodotdev/KiroCrew` (a fork's own CI on its `main`),
    or a `pull_request` whose head repository is not this one, gets
    `ubuntu-latest`; every other run still needs the event and actor checks
    in [the migration contract](#linux-and-windows-codebuild-migration) before
    receiving the CodeBuild label. The webhook on the AWS side is
    additionally filtered to runs triggered by accounts that can push to this
    repository (plus dependabot), so a fork PR that rewrites its workflow to force
    the label never starts a build — its job simply never gets a runner. The
    `workflow_job` payload carries no "from a fork" bit, which is why both layers
    exist rather than one.
  - **The image is not `ubuntu-latest`.** It is `aws/codebuild/standard:7.0`
    (Ubuntu 22.04). Anything a job assumed pre-installed must come from a
    `setup-*` action; `cfn-lint` already installs its own Python. Moving another
    job here means checking that first.
  - **Rollback is one line:** in the `changes` job's `Pick the Linux runner
    label` step, set both outputs to `ubuntu-latest` (or, for one job, replace
    its `runs-on` reference with `ubuntu-latest`). A CodeBuild project that
    receives webhooks for jobs it does not match starts nothing.
  - **A queued job is not bounded by `timeout-minutes`.** That budget starts when a
    runner picks the job up. A job whose log shows the `codebuild-…` label and no
    runner means the webhook did not start a build — the project name in the label
    does not match, or the triggering account is not on the allowlist (a new
    maintainer's first push) — and it will sit *queued* until GitHub's own
    ~24-hour pending limit, blocking that PR's `PR Readiness` the whole time with
    no in-repo signal. The response is the rollback above, not waiting for the
    timeout; the allowlist and the project name are fixed on the infrastructure
    side, not in this file.
  - **A runner that starts and then loses its job leaves the job queued forever,
    and a watchdog heals it.** The webhook can start a build and the job can
    still never run. Every CodeBuild build registers a fresh just-in-time
    runner, and that runner has to open a broker session with GitHub before it
    can take the job. On 2026-09-12 the broker answered the runner's first
    `CreateSession` with a 500 having already half-created the session, so every
    retry was refused with "a session for this runner already exists";
    `actions/runner` gives up on that conflict after a hard-coded four minutes,
    GitHub's cleanup of the ghost session takes longer than that, and the runner
    exits 0 — CodeBuild recorded the build as SUCCEEDED. The job it was started
    for stayed *queued* (its label names one run attempt, so no other runner can
    ever match it; see the `timeout-minutes` point above), the run stayed
    *in_progress*, and because the `CI` concurrency group does not cancel
    in-progress runs on `main`, every later `main` push was held *pending* behind
    it and then evicted by the next push: one orphaned frontend shard held
    `main`'s group for ten hours (19:33 to 05:31 UTC) and cost eleven `main`
    verdicts before a human cancelled the run. The runner-side defect is
    upstream and open
    ([actions/runner#3441](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/3441);
    same family as
    [#3624](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/3624) and
    [#2809](https://github.com/actions/runner/issues/2809)), so the repository
    carries a watchdog rather than waiting for it:
    `.github/workflows/ci-runner-watchdog.yml` runs `scripts/ci/runner_watchdog.py`
    every ten minutes on `ubuntu-latest` (never on CodeBuild — a watchdog for a
    path cannot depend on that path), and again whenever a `fast-gate.yml` run
    completes (`workflow_run`, any conclusion). The second trigger is the kick:
    GitHub's `schedule` is best-effort, and on 2026-10-04 the `*/10` ticks landed
    about 100 minutes apart, so a `main` Fast Gate job orphaned nine minutes
    before one tick (too young to act on) waited ninety minutes for the next while
    two later `main` pushes went red behind it. A completed Fast Gate is a
    heartbeat the repository already emits once per head, so a kicked tick runs
    the same script with the same arming — except that before any listing it
    reads the watchdog's own recent runs (one call, `kick_is_redundant`) and
    stands down when a tick already STARTED within the last schedule interval;
    only a late schedule turns a kick into a full tick, so the quota shape stays
    the schedule's. Only a tick that RAN counts: a kick that stands down cancels
    itself so its row reads `cancelled`, and `cancelled`/`skipped` rows and
    `queued` siblings (held by the concurrency group) are ignored -- otherwise
    kicks arriving less than an interval apart would stand down for each other
    and no full tick would run between crons. A `workflow_run`
    run carries the triggering run's head, so the kick's step runs with
    `continue-on-error` and never reds an unrelated pull request's checks; its
    verdict is in the step log and summary, and the scheduled ticks stay loud.
    It lists the queued and in-progress runs
    REPO-WIDE — one paginated `GET /repos/{repo}/actions/runs?status=…` per
    status returns runs of every workflow at once — and keeps only those whose
    `path` names a workflow that routes jobs to the CodeBuild fleet — `ci.yml`,
    `fast-gate.yml`, `main-ratchet-audit.yml`, `build.yml` and eleven others,
    the set pinned in the script as `WATCHED_WORKFLOWS` and tested against the
    workflows whose `runs-on` actually carries the fleet label (the watchdog's
    own workflow is excluded, since that label appears only in its comment). One
    listing per status covers the whole watched set as a client-side filter, which
    reaches a fleet-routed workflow nobody registered — breadth a per-workflow loop
    cannot have, and not the same thing as reaching further back in time. Depth is
    the page walk: this endpoint returns pages below `per_page` mid-listing (98,
    then 100, then 100, then 99 while `total_count` stood at 927, measured
    2026-09-24), so only an EMPTY page ends the walk. Reading a short page as the
    tail stopped every tick after page one, which left the sweep seeing the newest
    couple of minutes of runs against a 15-minute orphan threshold and hid two
    six-hour `main` outages; the six-hour orphan behind the second one sat on page
    seven. Live statuses read at most ten
    pages each — the API's reachable window, since a status-filtered runs listing
    stops at 1000 results — and each live classification sweep reads jobs for at
    most 50
    runs: up to 10 reserved for the newest runs that are themselves at least one
    saturation wait old (a younger run cannot hold a served start that waited that
    long and so could only ever report the fleet dispatching), falling back to the
    newest runs when none qualifies, since an empty reserve reads as an outage; the
    rest go to the classify slice, ranked actionable-shaped first (a `push` run of a
    heal-safe workflow past the orphan threshold) then oldest. The split is dynamic —
    a short reserve hands its unused reads to the classify slice instead of leaving
    them unspent. Spending the whole bound oldest first would
    leave a backlogged sweep unable to tell a dead fleet from a busy one, so it
    would heal nothing exactly when the watchdog is needed. Ranking inside the classify
    slice puts the heal-eligible shape first — a same-repository `push` or
    `pull_request` run of a workflow declared heal-safe for that event, AND past the
    orphan threshold — then oldest within each class, because age alone hands those
    slots to runs no heal will ever touch: 220 watched live runs sat past the orphan
    threshold on 2026-09-24 and 18 past a day, the oldest 36 days, runs that stay
    listed and re-read the same slot on every tick (a fork's run, or a closed pull
    request's, which the heal now cancels rather than re-reads). The log names the
    bound when other runs wait for the
    next tick. Cancelled recovery reads at most ten pages, the same as the live
    listings, because GitHub caps a status-filtered runs listing at 1000 results —
    measured on this repository, page 11 returns an empty `workflow_runs` and
    `total_count: 0`, not an error — so a deeper cap describes pages the endpoint
    never serves. Ten pages hold 1000 cancellations, about five hours at the 200 an
    hour this repo was measured at, and the 2026-09-20 orphans were 21 hours old,
    so that reach is BEST-EFFORT and carries no coverage claim. GitHub offers no
    ordering by cancellation time, so nothing readable from the listing can prove
    every run cancelled inside the window was seen; truncation logs a warning, and a
    cancelled run that never got listed needs `gh run rerun` by hand. The reach only
    changes how often that is true. Because that 1000-result ceiling also serves an
    empty page, an empty page is not proof of the tail: every live listing compares
    the runs it yielded against the first page's `total_count`, and a shortfall on an
    ACTIONABLE status (`in_progress`, `queued`) records a tick-level failure so the
    scheduled run goes red. A `pending` shortfall only warns, because those runs are
    held by their concurrency group, have no jobs, and are never healed — and
    `pending` is what grows during the saturation the watchdog has to survive. The
    remedy the failure prints is to NARROW the listing, not to raise the cap, since
    the cap is already the reachable window. The three live indexes plus
    the cancelled index cost at most 40 calls
    per tick. It
    calls a run *orphaned* when one of its jobs is still `queued`,
    carries a `codebuild-` label, and has waited more than 15 minutes
    (queue-to-start on CodeBuild is measured in seconds here, so that margin is
    generous). It then cancels the run, waits for the cancellation to land, and
    re-runs it: the re-run is a new attempt, so `changes` recomputes the label
    with the new attempt suffix and GitHub emits fresh `workflow_job.queued`
    webhooks that start fresh runners. The re-run cap of five per tick is one
    global budget across every watched workflow, not five per workflow. The
    watchdog re-runs *all* jobs rather
    than only the failed ones, because `gh run rerun --failed` reuses the first
    attempt's `changes` outputs and therefore re-queues the routed jobs under a
    label whose attempt suffix is stale, and CodeBuild's documentation does not
    say whether it honours that. (It did on CI run 36831273812: attempts 2 and 3
    of a `--failed` rerun kept the `-1` label on their Linux and Windows jobs and
    each got a fresh runner within two minutes.) A workflow clears TWO heal-safety gates. The
    declared gate is `HEAL_SAFE_WORKFLOWS`, a written judgement that a full
    re-run is safe, and it is the LOAD-BEARING one: a workflow joining the
    watched set is exempt until a person puts it there. There are two declared
    sets, keyed the way their successor check needs. `HEAL_SAFE_WORKFLOWS` is
    REF-KEYED and covers every event: a push run's successor is the newest run of
    its branch in the runs listing, which filters by head branch, event and head
    repository, never by pull-request number. `HEAL_SAFE_PULL_REQUEST_WORKFLOWS` is
    PR-KEYED and covers pull-request runs only: a pull-request run is judged by HEAD
    SHA — one `pulls?head=owner:branch&state=open` read says which SHAs the open
    pull requests on the branch have — and then by the branch listing for a newer
    run AT that SHA. Superseded when the head moved (its successor is the newest
    listed run at an open head) or when no open pull request has the branch
    (nothing to restore; a live orphan is cancelled and not re-run). A newer run at
    the SAME SHA — `labeled`, `unlabeled`, `edited` and `reopened` each start one,
    and every declared pull-request workflow cancels the run in progress when it
    arrives — is the successor when both payloads name the same pull request,
    a sibling pull request's run (shared head branch, its own group) when they name
    different ones, and when either names none the listing cannot say and the
    watchdog fails closed: the run is left untouched (a live pull-request orphan is
    judged before its cancel, so nothing is cancelled that nobody can then re-run),
    the tick reds and names both runs. It deliberately does not resolve that case by
    watching the group's own cancel: every orphan this script meets exists during a
    fleet outage, where the run to watch stays queued and observation cannot settle,
    and a green resting on an unobserved provider behaviour is the false green this
    script must never produce. A successor is restored only when identified as the
    same pull request's; a same-SHA run of unknown pull request, or a head move with
    no identifiable successor, that appears after the re-run started withdraws the
    re-run and reds the tick naming the head, rather than restore a sibling's run and
    hide the loss. The one green path that touches a concurrency group — cancel, then
    re-run of a run judged current with no newer run at its SHA — is the path push
    runs already take. That is the only use of `pull_requests[].number`
    on the run payload; the head question never depends on it (most same-repository
    runs lack it). On a push
    the PR number is empty and a PR-keyed group is a constant, so a push run of a
    PR-keyed workflow is exempt; a test pins every PR-keyed entry pull-request-only.
    `macos-on-demand.yml`, ref-keyed and pull-request-only, is declared: its runs
    are pull-request runs, which are healed, and a test pins that every declared
    workflow has a trigger a heal can act on. Nine of the fifteen are auto-healed.
    The derived gate is
    BEST-EFFORT. It requires a run-level concurrency group
    keyed on `github.ref`, `github.ref_name` or `github.head_ref` — or, for a
    pull-request run and only then, on the pull-request number — which is a
    structural fact it reads
    reliably, and it rejects the publish and deploy spellings it knows: package
    or release
    publishing, Pages deployment, Docker pushes, S3 or CodeArtifact publishing,
    `twine` uploads,
    signing or notarization, any job-level `environment:`, and `pages: write`,
    `packages: write`, or `deployments: write`. `id-token: write` alone is
    ordinary OIDC authentication. A publish step in a spelling the patterns miss
    — a new marketplace action, a toolchain nobody here uses yet — is caught by
    neither gate, which is why the declaration is the judgement and the
    derivation is a backstop rather than the reverse. Pinning each declared
    workflow's content instead would expire the declaration on every edit to
    `ci.yml` or `fast-gate.yml`, the two most-edited files in the repo, so the
    cost lands on every unrelated change. `HEAL_SAFE_WORKFLOWS` in
    `scripts/ci/runner_watchdog.py` is the membership, and a partition test
    pins it against `WATCHED_WORKFLOWS`, so read the set rather than a count
    here: prose restating a pinned set goes stale in silence. The reasons a
    workflow lands outside it are publishing, a per-commit, per-run or
    PULL-REQUEST concurrency key, no run-level group at all, and a constant group.
    A pattern earns its place by naming a route this repo could really grow, and a
    test fails on one that matches nothing here and names no such route, so the
    backstop cannot drift into chasing spellings for toolchains nobody uses. The derived
    gate is fail-closed, so it can silently DISABLE healing as well as allow it: a
    test asserts it admits each declared workflow's own real YAML, which is what
    turns a benign edit that the hand-rolled parser misreads into a red at edit
    time rather than a surprise at the next incident. Exempt
    runs stay listed, classified, logged, and named in the
    step summary with a `human-required-heal-exempt-workflow` outcome, which is a
    FAILED outcome: most of the watched set is exempt, so reporting a stuck run
    there as a warning inside a passing scheduled run would leave the shape of the
    incident this watchdog exists for — a stuck run nobody is told about — intact
    for the majority of the repository. The
    watchdog never cancels or fully re-runs them. Immediately before a live
    orphan is cancelled, the watchdog reads the workflow file from that run's
    `head_sha` through the repository contents API and re-derives heal-safety.
    Cancelled-orphan recovery performs the same run-revision check before its
    re-run. A revision read and judged unsafe is human-required and healthy; a
    revision nobody could read, or a run with no SHA, is UNKNOWN rather than
    unsafe and reports `heal-safety-unreadable-at-run-revision`, a FAILED
    outcome, so a cancelled run cannot age out of its window behind a green
    tick. Neither answer cancels anything. A queued `codebuild-` job is
    also what CodeBuild account-concurrency saturation looks like, so the
    watchdog reads what the *other* routed jobs are doing, counting only starts
    after the orphaned job queued (a fleet that was fine before the orphan
    queued says nothing about the fleet it is waiting on). The orphaned job's
    *own* queue is asked first: a routed label is
    `codebuild-<project>-<run>-<attempt>`, optionally with an `instance-size`
    override, and the project plus override name the queue while the run and
    attempt are only there because CodeBuild requires them. A start served by that
    same queue after the orphan queued stood in the same line and got out of it —
    one that waited a third of the orphan threshold or more inside the last 30
    minutes means that queue is saturated and the tick holds; prompt ones and
    nothing slow mean the orphan was never in that line, whatever another label's
    queue is doing. The usual carrier is the run's own sibling jobs: thirteen of
    fourteen fast-gate jobs starting in under a minute while one sits for an hour
    and a half is the dropped-dispatch shape exactly, and before this reading a
    seven-minute start on another fleet held such an orphan unhealed for six hours.
    Old prompt starts count for that reading (the orphan's place in line does not
    age); an old slow start with nothing recent counts for nothing. Only when the
    orphan's own queue served nothing usable is the fleet-wide, label-blind reading
    used — if a CodeBuild job that did get a runner started in that window after
    waiting a third of the orphan threshold or more, CodeBuild is queueing, and the
    tick reports the runs as
    `skipped-saturated` and heals nothing; if *nothing* has started on
    CodeBuild in that window (live runs, then the newest completed runs), the
    evidence is inconclusive — a fleet outage looks exactly like an orphan from
    the queued side — and the tick reports `skipped-no-dispatch-evidence`,
    heals nothing, and points at the rollback above. That outage hold applies even
    when the orphan's own queue read as dispatching, because the own-queue reading
    settles the orphan's place in line, not whether the fleet is up now. If a run old
    enough to hold a
    served start past the threshold went unread against the per-tick job-read bound,
    the sweep reports `skipped-partial-dispatch-evidence` instead of acting, because
    the completed-run sample cannot close that gap: it reads the newest completions,
    and a fleet serving some jobs promptly while queueing others past the threshold
    puts a prompt start there. The premise is the unread saturation-capable runs
    rather than the bound being reached, so a sweep whose unread band is all too
    young to have carried such a start may still act. An own-queue dispatching
    reading does not lift this hold: it is read off the starts the sweep read, and
    the slow same-queue start that would refute it can sit in a run nobody read.
    On a tick that has an orphan to judge, the sweep first reads the jobs of every
    unread run that could hold such a start, up to 200 more reads (all or nothing:
    a partial read cannot lift the hold, so a larger set is not read at all), so the
    hold is reached only past that top-up bound; a tick with no orphan spends none
    of those reads, which is why they are not folded into the per-tick bound.
    The unread runs are retained
    with their creation times and re-judged on age at each cancel, not counted once:
    the cancel phase re-reads the listing once and then judges several cancels
    against it, so a run just under the line at the read is over it minutes later.
    The bound's reserved reads go
    to the newest runs at least one saturation wait old, since a younger run cannot
    contain a wait that long and so could only ever report the fleet dispatching. The
    line is deliberately low because the fleet-wide reading is label-blind: a start
    served quickly on another label says nothing about the queue the orphaned job is
    in, so raising it would widen the window in which a queued-but-alive job is
    cancelled.
    A tick that observed any served CodeBuild start logs the slowest of them against
    the line, which is the drift a raise has to be calibrated from (#13644); a tick
    that saw none has nothing to measure and logs nothing. Guard rails: runs younger than
    the orphan threshold are never actionable, and the two age bands differ -- a run at
    least a third of that threshold old is what the evidence reserve is spent on, while
    a younger one is not reserved a read while any run qualifies and is read only if a
    classify slot remains after the actionable-shaped and older runs (a prompt start
    inside one is dispatch evidence) -- the exception being the reserve's fallback,
    where NO run can carry a slow start and the newest are reserved anyway because an
    empty reserve reads as an outage; the verdict is re-derived from a fresh read
    immediately before the cancel and the cancel is sent only if the same
    attempt is still orphaned (a human who re-ran it by hand has moved it to a
    new attempt, which is left alone); fork runs are reported, never touched, and so
    are PULL-REQUEST runs -- the successor check asks whether a newer run of this
    branch is in flight, GitHub's runs listing can only be filtered by branch NAME,
    and two pull requests can share one head branch, so each would read as the
    other's successor and abandon a cancelled orphan behind a green
    `skipped-superseded`; matching by pull-request number instead is not available
    (of 20 sampled same-repository `pull_request` runs only 9 carried
    `pull_requests[].number`). Their owners read their own pull request's checks,
    unlike the `main` orphans this watchdog exists for, which still heal; a
    run at attempt 3 or later is reported, never touched, so a run that keeps
    orphaning is escalated rather than looped — unless its workflow is heal-exempt,
    where the cap is not the operative reason (we never re-run those at all) and the
    orphan reports `human-required` so it does not sit behind a green tick; at most
    five runs are healed per
    tick, and a recovery pass cut short by a rate limit still reports the slots it
    already spent, so the abort cannot buy five more; a refused cancel or re-run
    (403 when a human got there first) is
    logged and left for the next tick. A pre-cancel evidence re-read that fails on a
    one-off error defers and stays green, but one that fails on a RATE LIMIT carries
    `aborted-rate-limited` and reds the tick: a limit is a condition, not a one-off,
    so every tick would otherwise defer and look healthy while the orphan keeps
    parking later pushes behind it. Once a cancel is accepted the watchdog
    owns the run until it is re-run: it polls to `completed`, escalates to
    `force-cancel` after 90 s, and re-runs each run as it completes inside one
    shared five-minute budget. The whole tick runs inside the script's own
    Every tick logs its OWN footprint -- how many GitHub API calls it made and the
    last `X-RateLimit-Remaining` the API reported -- because this watchdog is a
    heavy consumer of the very shared installation quota whose exhaustion it exists
    to survive: the cancelled index alone is sixteen pages per tick. That reading is
    logged, never enforced. A self-imposed call cap would silently stop healing,
    which is the failure this script ends; read the numbers across a few scheduled
    ticks to judge whether the bounds are sustainable per hour.
    nine-minute budget, and a re-run is begun only while enough of it remains
    to verify the re-run at its longest (a newer run landing in the window and
    being restored, in turn), so the job's `timeout-minutes` — set above the
    budget — never cuts a restoration off half-way; a re-run that cannot start
    in time is named in an error and left for the recovery pass. The
    saturation/outage evidence is re-read once before any run is re-read for
    its cancel and judged against the current wall clock, so a run's own
    re-read sits immediately before its cancel, and a fleet that saturated
    since the top of the tick holds the run (and one that cannot be re-read
    fails closed); a cancel itself is posted only while enough of the budget
    remains to verify its re-run. The API has no conditional cancel or
    re-run, so each mutation is verified after the fact: once a cancel lands, the run's
    conclusion and attempt are read back (a run that finished on its own keeps
    its verdict; one somebody re-ran in the gap is re-run again), and every
    re-run is bracketed by unconditional newest-of-branch checks — before it,
    and again after a short settle. Heal-safety determines whether the watchdog
    may reach that guard; the guard itself treats every heal-safe run alike.
    This keeps a newer run from being left cancelled by the re-run's entry into
    a supersedable concurrency group: the re-run is
    cancelled, that cancellation is waited out (force-cancelled if slow; if it
    still has not completed the tick fails rather than judge), and the newer run is read
    until it reaches a terminal state or the settle window closes (a cancelled
    successor is re-run through the same bracket, so a run landing in *its*
    window is restored in turn, two levels deep at most, unless a yet-newer run
    has taken the branch over; one still running when the window closes is
    never called settled, since a group cancel can land late, and is a named
    failure instead). Every read on that path
    is guarded (and a cancel or re-run whose response was lost is never
    re-posted — it is reconciled from the run's own state, since a repeat on a
    landed mutation is a conflict that would read as a refusal), and every wait is a wall-clock window capped by the tick's
    deadline (API latency counts, not just the sleeps): an API failure keeps the run owned (a status poll that fails is
    retried until the shared deadline names the run; a successor that cannot be
    read for the whole window is a failed outcome that names it), and a read
    that fails before any mutation leaves the run untouched — no API error can
    escape the heal with a cancelled run unnamed. The lookup behind those
    checks matches branch *names*, which forks share, so it is paged until a
    run from the same head repository appears and fails closed — red tick, run
    named — if the listing never reaches ours; a successor that does not settle
    inside the window, a successor that cannot be re-run, and a re-run refusal
    that nobody else's re-run explains all red the tick the same way, so a lost
    verdict is never a green watchdog; a run that outlives the budget is named in an
    error, the job exits 1, and the next tick's recovery pass re-runs it —
    that pass reads recently cancelled `CI` runs, pull requests included,
    recognises the orphan fingerprint on their cancelled jobs (`codebuild-`
    label, no runner name, queued past the threshold when cancelled — a shape a
    healthy run a human stopped never shows, so a deliberate cancel is not
    resurrected), applies the same unconditional newest-of-branch guard, and
    re-runs only those still newest.
    The saturation/outage hold does not apply to it: that hold protects
    finished work, and a cancelled orphan has none left — re-running it into an
    outage leaves it queued until the fleet returns, whereas holding it would
    let the recovery window expire and abandon it silently. It runs before the
    live heals and takes the per-tick cap first, so a sustained backlog of live
    orphans cannot starve it until the window expires. It walks the window
    **oldest first** and classifies at most `RECOVERY_CLASSIFY_READS` (50) runs
    per tick, because classifying one costs a job read. Almost none of the
    cancellation traffic reaches that bound: every `main` push cancels the run it
    supersedes, and a cancelled run that did not live as long as the orphan
    threshold cannot hold a job that queued past it, since a job's queue wait is
    contained in its run's lifetime. Those are skipped for free — of 1000
    consecutive cancelled runs measured over 6.8 days the median lived 4 seconds
    and 2 reached the threshold, so the busiest 90-minute window holds 400
    cancelled runs but 2 candidates. What the bound does spend goes on the runs
    closest to ageing out, and a newer arrival waits for the next tick instead of
    displacing an older orphan; a tail run with less than one schedule interval of
    window left has no next tick, so it is recorded rather than deferred. The same
    zero-read exclusion applies there, so a run that could not have held an orphan
    never asks a human to look. **A GitHub rate limit is
    survivable, not a lost tick.** A 403 or 429 whose body names a rate limit is
    honoured against its `Retry-After` / `X-RateLimit-Reset` with one cheap,
    in-budget wait-and-retry -- the cancelled-recovery pass's reads included, since
    a run with less window left than one schedule interval has no next tick and a
    five-second reset must not cost its verdict; recovery's MUTATIONS are never
    retried, because a cancel or re-run that may be on the wire is never repeated.
    When the reset is too far off, the tick stops
    gathering, acts on the runs it already classified, and ends with an
    `aborted-rate-limited` outcome the summary names. That outcome is a FAILURE
    and the tick exits nonzero, whatever it managed to classify first: the same
    abort skips the cancelled-orphan recovery pass, and recovery is the only
    thing between a cancelled run and the end of its 90-minute window, so
    "the next tick re-lists" is no answer for a run in the final tick-interval of
    that window while the limit persists. What the abort still buys is the work
    already done: one exhausted listing page leaves the runs already classified
    acted on rather than lost. Every other status (401, 404, 5xx) and every
    malformed payload still raises. **The schedule is armed**: `WATCHDOG_ARMED` at the top of the
    workflow is `"true"`, so a scheduled tick cancels and re-runs what it
    classifies, within the per-tick caps below. It shipped disarmed — every
    scheduled tick a dry run that classified and wrote its step summary and
    touched nothing — and was armed once detection-without-action had been
    measured to cost two six-hour `main` outages, on 2026-09-23 and 2026-09-24.
    Both times one stuck `fast-gate.yml` run held `main`'s single concurrency
    slot, every later push lost its gate to eviction, `ci.yml` failed closed at
    its 720-second wait, and a human cleared it with one
    `POST /actions/runs/<id>/cancel` — the call the armed tick now makes itself.
    The hold that would otherwise have refused those heals is cleared by the
    supersession check: a run a newer push has replaced holds no result worth
    protecting, so a busy fleet no longer shields the exact run that is blocking
    the branch -- at attempt 1. Past attempt 1 the heal path refuses the cancel
    itself (a later attempt may be somebody's hand re-run, see below) and the
    tick goes red naming the run. A manual dispatch is
    governed by its own `dry_run` input regardless, so a run can still be
    inspected without acting. A `CI` run in *pending* with no jobs is
    **not** something the watchdog touches — that run is waiting on its
    concurrency group, not on a runner, and healing the run that holds the group
    is what releases it; the step summary names it so the reader knows why it
    waits. **Manual fallback** when the watchdog itself is held queued by
    Actions saturation, or for a run it declined: `gh run cancel <run-id>`, wait
    for the run to report `completed`, then `gh run rerun <run-id>`
    (`gh run rerun <run-id> --failed` keeps the successful jobs but carries the
    stale-label caveat). `workflow_dispatch` with `dry_run: true` (the default
    for a manual dispatch) detects and reports without acting. **A hand re-run is
    safe from the watchdog's cancel once a newer push supersedes it**: a run past
    attempt 1 may be the very `gh run rerun` above, and cancelling a superseded run
    is never followed by a re-run (the heal path declines to re-run a superseded
    run, `superseded-before-cancel` is not a failed outcome, and the recovery pass
    classifies a superseded cancelled run out), so it would be a silent loss. The
    guard sits at the cancel itself, so every route reaches it -- an orphan with
    no fleet hold, and one whose hold the supersession check released alike: for
    any attempt past the first the heal path asks the supersession question
    immediately before cancelling and leaves a superseded (or undecidable) run
    untouched. That is a failed outcome
    (`rerun-attempt-superseded-left-untouched`): the run keeps its concurrency
    group's running slot and the watchdog will never free it, so the tick goes
    red and its log names the `gh run cancel <run-id>` to type. A re-run attempt
    that is still its branch's newest is healed like any orphan. A held
    concurrency group a human is told about is the cheaper failure.
  - **Trust model.** A self-hosted runner exposes its host identity to the job it
    runs; that is inherent, not something this PR adds. What bounds it: only runs
    triggered by accounts that can push here reach the runner (forks never do);
    the runner role can write one log group and mint a GitHub token from one
    connection, nothing else, in an account holding nothing else; and an alert fires on
    any token minted through that connection by anything other than CodeBuild's own
    runner registration. The residual — a job step minting a GitHub App token whose
    repository permissions may exceed a writer's — is detected, not prevented.
    Two recommended controls are **not yet in place**: an organization-level
    ruleset on `main` whose bypass excludes GitHub Apps (drafted; needs an org
    owner), and a check that the App installation is scoped to this repository
    alone (needs repository-settings access).
  - **Pilot exit condition.** The pilot ends on whichever comes first: **50
    non-fork `CI` runs** with the second wave in place or **2026-10-10**. The
    second wave went in one day after the first, on the first wave's early data
    (every `cfn-lint` build started 18–21 s after the job was queued) plus the
    second wave's own first run (all ten jobs it routed, same 18–21 s); that is a
    small sample, which is why the criterion below now covers the whole routed
    set rather than gating a further expansion. Keep the routing only if the
    median queue-to-start on CodeBuild stays under 60 s and no routed job waits
    longer than the hosted baseline's mean (155 s) for a runner; otherwise roll
    it back. Migrating the feasible jobs together in one PR does not waive this
    queue-retention criterion. Record Linux and Windows startup evidence separately;
    a running job or a successful test result does not establish acceptable queue
    latency. Namespace-dependent jobs (`backend-test-sandbox`,
    `e2e-private-namespace`), the Task Scheduler pod boot canary, the IPv6 and
    strict kernel-lock legs, Linux packaging and macOS retain hosted runners.
    Record the measured outcome so this entry does not become a permanent one-off.

- **The macOS peer-identity canary is asserted by name.** `pytest -q` does not name
  passing tests and a skip exits 0, so a canary that quietly stopped running (a
  changed `skipif`, a collection change) would leave the job green while the gate
  it proves went unverified. The step runs that one node id with `-v` and greps for
  `1 passed`.
- **`backend-test-sandbox` fails loudly rather than skipping.** It clears
  `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns`, then runs `unshare --mount
  --map-root-user true` as a probe. If the runner image ever stops allowing the
  namespace, the job fails instead of letting the suite silently skip and the gate
  go green having asserted nothing. This is what gives the `hooks.py`
  sensitive-path keystone real CI coverage.
- **`backend-test-crew-container` cannot go green by skipping.** Installing the
  image's runtime dependencies in a dedicated lane fixes one instance of the
  problem; the mechanism that caused it, a conftest that answers a missing
  dependency with `collect_ignore_glob`, so the whole suite reads as present while
  executing zero times, survives any dependency rename or extras split. So the lane
  that installs them also sets `CREW_CONTAINER_TESTS_REQUIRED=1`, and under that
  variable the suite refuses to skip: a missing dependency or a non-POSIX host is a
  collection error, every `test_*.py` that defines a test function must contribute at
  least one collected item, every `test*` name the source declares must yield an item
  of its own, and the total must sit at or above `_MIN_COLLECTED` while running no
  more than `_FLOOR_MARGIN` above it. That last bound is what keeps the floor honest:
  a hand-written floor left behind by a growing suite stops measuring anything, so
  the collection outrunning it is an error rather than a cushion, and the message
  names the value to write. Its accepted cost is a merge race: two branches may each
  add up to `_FLOOR_MARGIN` tests, clear the bound separately, and compose past it
  without either one editing the constant, so the lane can red on `main` for a commit
  that did not grow the suite. That is a one-integer follow-up rather than a
  regression, and the error message says so. The variable can only ever turn a skip
  into a failure, never the reverse, so setting it can hide nothing. This is the same shape as
  `backend-test-sandbox`'s `unshare` probe, moved inside the instrument.
- **`coverage-gate` is fail-closed, and the split made that load-bearing.** It runs
  `if: always()` and its first step converts any non-success upstream result into an
  explicit failure, because GitHub treats a **skipped** required check as satisfied.
  That was already the right shape when the only way to skip a test job was a path
  filter or a failed dependency. It is now the mechanism that keeps the whole
  `await-fast-gate` design honest: a red gate deliberately SKIPS `backend-test` and
  `frontend-test`, and without this step a required Coverage Gate would skip with
  them and be reported as satisfied — so the barrier that exists to save runner time
  would also have quietly removed the coverage floor. The `if: always()` is what
  makes it emit a real verdict, and the first step is what makes that verdict red.
  `frontend-coverage-merge` carries the other half of the same problem and solves it
  the opposite way: its `!cancelled()` needed an explicit
  `needs.frontend-test.result != 'skipped'` clause, because a skipped shard set has
  nothing to stitch and the merge would otherwise go red for missing an artifact
  instead of for the gate the developer actually has to fix. A FAILED shard set still
  has something to stitch, which is why the clause names `skipped` and not both. It
  also compares the raw line-rate and rounds only for display, so 89.95% cannot pass
  a 90% floor.
- **`coverage-gate` enforces two different shapes.** The project floors
  (`BACKEND_MIN`, `FRONTEND_MIN`) compare one lane-wide average; the per-file floor
  (`PER_FILE_MIN`, `scripts/check_per_file_coverage.py`) requires *every measured
  file* to clear it. Both are needed because an average is satisfiable without
  touching the files that carry the risk — a well-covered large file pays for a
  bare small one. The per-file gate exempts only the files listed in
  `.github/coverage-baselines/{backend,frontend}.txt`, and that list may only
  shrink: an unlisted file below the floor fails, a listed file that slides further
  fails, and a listed file that *clears* the floor by the same noise band fails
  until it is removed. Refresh with `--update-baseline`, which **prunes only** —
  it cannot add a path or rewrite a recorded rate, so neither a new offender nor a
  regression can be cleared by refreshing instead of by adding tests; seeding a
  new lane is a separate `--seed-baseline`. The floor's rationale and measured
  cost live in the script's docstring, not here, so they cannot go stale in two
  places. Per-file enforcement is skipped for a lane whose suite ran as a
  coverage-free subset, because subset rates are not comparable to a baseline
  recorded on the full suite.
- **`eslint src/ --max-warnings 0` is a hard ceiling, not a stored baseline.**
  The tree carries no warnings, so any warning a change introduces fails this
  job. Never lift the ceiling to admit one: a ceiling above the measured count is
  a budget new warnings land inside without anyone seeing them, and a warning
  admitted that way is indistinguishable from the rest. Fix it, or suppress that
  one line with `// eslint-disable-next-line <rule> -- <why the code is correct>`,
  which is reviewable in the diff where a lifted ceiling is not.
  `test_eslint_warning_ceiling.py` pins the zero and pins that `ci.yml` declares
  exactly one ceiling, so it cannot be lifted quietly — and because the value is
  fixed rather than measured, naming it here cannot go stale.
- **The i18n chain separates diff-scoped zero-tolerance checks, whole-repo hard
  zeros, a whole-repo growth ceiling, and report-only measurements.** The first
  three classes can fail; report-only rows cannot. Full rules:
  [i18n-gates.md](i18n-gates.md).
- **Every gate that needs a base ref fails rather than skipping when it cannot
  resolve one.** `actions/checkout` fetches depth 1, so
  `.github/scripts/resolve-i18n-base.sh` fetches the one commit and exits non-zero
  if it cannot; a gate that cannot run must fail, not pass.
- **`I18N_BASE_REF` is `pull_request.base.sha`, not `origin/main`.** The base tip is
  a moving target measured at step time while the checked-out tree is a snapshot
  from job start, so anything landing on `main` in between would appear only on the
  base side and be charged to every PR in that window.
- **The e2e gateway boots with `KIROCREW_STRICT_ON_LOOP_PERSIST=1`**, so an
  un-offloaded session-JSONL mutator that enters the lock on the event loop raises
  and fails the gate at PR time. `KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE=1` turns an
  environment-resolution miss into a hard failure, since a skipped suite would
  otherwise count as a pass having run zero browser specs. Details:
  [e2e-gate.md](e2e-gate.md).

### Expand a bash array the `+` way, not the quoted way

In a workflow `run:` block, write an array's value expansion as
`${arr[@]+"${arr[@]}"}` rather than `"${arr[@]}"`. Bash only stopped treating an
EMPTY array's expansion as an unset variable in 4.4, and macOS ships 3.2.57 as
`/bin/bash`, so under `set -u` the quoted form aborts the whole step with
`arr[@]: unbound variable` the moment the array happens to be empty. The `+` form
expands to nothing when the array is unset or empty and to every element
otherwise, on every bash, so it changes nothing about how Actions runs these
scripts on Linux.

That matters because these scripts do not only run on the Actions runner: about
two dozen tests EXTRACT a `run:` block and execute it with the host `bash`
(`test_pr_readiness_evaluate.py`, `test_fork_pr_description_workflow.py`,
`test_release_macos_fail_closed.py`, and others), so the macOS suite above runs
this shell under 3.2. A count guard is not a substitute: the array that cost a
nightly HAD one, and was emptied again after it, which is why
`test_workflow_array_expansion_bash32.py` asks for the local form at the
expansion instead of reasoning about reachability.

## `build.yml`: the artifacts still build

PR-time proof only, no publishing.

- **`build-wheel`** builds the frontend, stages it into the package, builds the
  wheel, then `pip install dist/*.whl` and `kirocrew --version` as a smoke test.
  Bare `--version` is a pre-dispatch fast-path (see
  `docs/system-specs/modules/cli.md`), so it proves the console script exists
  and exits 0 — not that `kiro_crew.cli`'s import chain resolves. An
  `import kiro_crew.cli` probe is what carries that meaning; the wheel lane
  does not run one, so an undeclared runtime dependency reaches gateway boot
  before any pip-install lane fails.
- **`build-desktop`** builds the Electron app unsigned through `make desktop` on
  `ubuntu-22.04` and `ubuntu-22.04-arm` for every PR; `macos-15` joins the matrix
  only when a packaging-sensitive path changed. Non-PR runs include all three,
  and every instantiated leg uploads its artifacts.
- **`build-windows-installer`** assembles the real python-build-standalone backend
  payload, builds and silently installs the NSIS artifact, then runs the installed
  gateway and bytecode-floor checks. See [e2e-gate.md](e2e-gate.md#buildymls-installer-job-boots-the-gateway-it-installed-on-every-pr).

**Neither desktop lane ever RUNS the bundled backend.** `build-desktop` here and
`build-desktop.yml` in the release lane both build the real `kirocrew-backend`
tree via `packaging/build-desktop.sh` — which provisions a
python-build-standalone interpreter and pip-installs the project into it — and
then only upload the artifact. The wheel lane at least runs `kirocrew --version`,
which since the `--version` fast-path lands before dispatch proves startup only.
So a packaging change that breaks the packaged app (a layout change, a launcher
rename, a dependency that fails to install into the bundled interpreter) passes
every gate: the tests that cover packaged-app behavior monkeypatch `sys.frozen`
and `sys.executable`, so they stay green against a simulated environment. The
cheap fix is to run the already-built launcher once in `build-desktop`, the
packaged analogue of the wheel lane's `--version`.

## `issue-gate.yml`: every PR traces to a sized issue (PAUSED)

Nothing else stops a feature or fix from being built on impulse, reviewed on its
own terms and merged with no record of why it exists or whether anyone agreed it
should. Issues already carry that record, and `Issue Gate` is the link that makes
a pull request consult it.

**Paused.** `GATE_ENFORCED` in the workflow is `"false"`: the job logs a notice,
writes a one-line job summary and passes before it reads the PR or any issue, so
it costs no API quota and blocks nothing. The reason is that the rule reads labels
the Captain writes, and the Captain's scheduled scan is not running yet; with no
labels arriving, every PR -- forks first -- would sit red on an issue nobody can
label. To switch the rule on, set `GATE_ENFORCED: "true"`; any value other than
`"true"` or `"false"` fails the job closed, so a typo can never read as "paused".
`test/test_issue_gate_refs.py` pins the switch as a literal boolean and runs the
step script, in both positions, against a stubbed `gh`.

**How it is enforced.** `PR Readiness` is the one status the branch ruleset
requires, so the gate is enrolled as a lane in `pr-readiness.yml`'s spec list
(`issue-gate.yml|Issue Gate`, appended beside `Code Review` because both run on
`pull_request` with no base filter and a read token, forks and stacked PRs
included) and in its `workflow_run` trigger list. A lane that list omits is a gate
that can go red without reddening the PR -- that is why enrolment is here and not
a second branch-protection entry. The merge queue needs no `merge_group` run of
the file: the queue's own `PR Readiness` poll admits only heads whose pull-request
verdict already included this lane.

**Who writes the triage state.** Not a workflow in this repository.
`issue-triage.yml` writes only `channel:`, the fixed type set, `area:` and
`platform:`. The Captain -- the maintainer-operated Kiro Crew triage crew (the
Issue Radar crews running against this repository) -- scans issues that carry no
tier and writes one of `tier:T1` .. `tier:T4`. It also marks the issue
`pending-triage`. `tier:T1` and `tier:T2` issues are handed to everyone and need
nothing more. A `tier:T3` or `tier:T4` issue is synced to the maintainers' task
tracker; its point of contact reads it and flips `pending-triage` to `triaged`.
A tier says how big the work is; it does not say anyone has looked, which is why
`pending-triage` / `triaged` exist as a separate pair. The older `needs-triage`
label and the verdict labels (`auto-fixable`, `needs-investigation`,
`needs-human`) are the Issue Radar dispatch pipeline's own state: they decide who
runs an issue, not whether a PR may merge, and the gate no longer reads them.
This repository holds the label contract (`TIER_LABELS`, `TIER_PASS_LABELS`,
`TIER_REVIEW_LABELS`, `PENDING_LABEL`, `TRIAGED_LABEL` in the workflow) and not
the crew itself, so a change to the label set is a change in both places.

**One grammar.** Which issues a body declares is decided by
`.github/scripts/issue_gate_refs.py`, an adapter onto the declaration grammar
`kirocrew-prepare-pr/scripts/pr_status.py` exports as its one public entry point
`declared_issue_numbers(body, repo)` -- the masking and the issue targets the
local kirocrew-prepare-pr loop uses too, so a change there reaches the gate and nothing is
re-derived in the workflow (a hand-rolled grep there, or an adapter rewrapping a
private pattern, drifts unnoticed). By reference to that grammar: a line that
starts (three columns of indent at most, an optional bullet) with a closing verb
(`close|closes|closed`, `fix|fixes|fixed`, `resolve|resolves|resolved` -- the
issue auto-closes on merge) or a non-closing `Refs` / `Part of` (the issue stays
open), plus `#N`, `OWNER/REPO#N` or a github.com issue URL, after HTML comments,
fenced code blocks (an unclosed fence through end of body) and inline code spans
are masked; every reference on that line is read, and what follows is free, so
`Fixes #123 (the Windows half)` counts. The PR template's own `<!-- ... Fixes
#123 -->` hint, a `>`-quoted or inline-code `Closes #N`, a four-column code line,
a reference buried mid-sentence and a bare `#N` are not declarations. Only
references naming this repository count, and a URL only on the github.com host,
since GitHub resolves nothing from `https://example.com/.../issues/N`; that rule
is part of the grammar itself, the adapter adds nothing to it. The tier and triage label
names the gate reads are pinned by `TestLabelContract` in
`test/test_issue_gate_refs.py`, the one in-repo place both sides of the contract
can read, so a rename shows up as a red test rather than as every PR going red.

The gate asks which issue the work is FOR, not what closes. That is why the
non-closing verbs count here: an author shipping half of an issue writes `Part of
#N`, the gate checks the same tier and triage labels, and the issue stays open for the rest;
`Closes #N` is the author saying the merge finishes it. `pr_status.py`'s own
`NOTICE:` path answers a different question (why did the HOST resolve no closure)
and keeps its whole-line, closing-verbs-only classifier for it -- but it no longer
accepts a `no linked issue:` opt-out line the gate would reject; its `NOTICE:`
names the gate instead. A body declaring
more than `MAX_DECLARED` (20) distinct issues is a finding, not a read: each
declared issue is an API call against the shared hourly token pool, from a body an
author controls, and a PR for that many issues is a PR to split.
`test/test_issue_gate_refs.py` and the `declared_issue_numbers` tests in
`test/test_prepare_pr_status.py` pin all of this.

**The grammar comes from the default branch, not the PR.** The workflow checks
out the repository's default branch at run time -- which the PR cannot write -- and
runs the adapter from there, so a PR cannot change what counts as a declaration
without that change first landing on `main`. Nothing from the PR's tree is
executed. The default branch rather than `pull_request.base.sha` on purpose: a
stacked PR's base is a feature branch, and one cut before the gate landed would
carry no grammar script and read as bootstrap. The workflow FILE is still read
from the merge ref, as every `pull_request` lane here is; the repository's answer
to that is the fork approval gate and CODEOWNERS review (see
`fork-workflow-guard.yml`), not something this lane can fix alone. Bootstrap: a
default branch that predates the gate has no grammar script; that state is skipped
with a notice, never filled by running PR code, and is dead once the gate is on
`main`.

**The rule, in full.** The visible body declares at least one issue of this
repository. Every declared number must be an issue (not a pull request), not
closed as `not_planned`, and carry exactly one tier label (`TIER_LABELS`:
`tier:T1` a bug whose fix keeps the design, `tier:T2` a small additive feature,
`tier:T3` a change to an existing experience that needs a one-pager, `tier:T4` a
new concept that needs a design review). None, or two, means nobody has settled
how big the work is, so the gate reds rather than guessing. Then the tier decides:

| Tier on the issue | Issue Gate |
|---|---|
| none, or more than one | red |
| `tier:T1`, `tier:T2` | green, whatever triage labels it carries |
| `tier:T3`, `tier:T4` with `triaged` | green |
| `tier:T3`, `tier:T4` with `pending-triage`, or with neither | red until a person flips it to `triaged` |
| `tier:T3`, `tier:T4` with both `pending-triage` and `triaged` | red; remove `pending-triage` |

The big tiers wait on a person for everyone, fork PRs and in-repo PRs alike: a
maintainer who wants one through sooner applies the `issue-gate: waived` label.
One bad reference fails the whole PR: a sized issue beside an unsized one is
still work nobody sized. The job summary lists each problem and says how to go
green: once the label lands, any edit to the description re-runs the check, which
is how a fork author -- who cannot press re-run -- gets there without a push.

Deterministic on purpose: no model, one checkout of the default branch (for the
grammar, nothing built), two API reads. The body is read from the API at run time rather than from
the event payload, and `edited` and `labeled` are in the trigger list, so adding
`Closes #N` to the description (or the waiver label) turns the check green
without a no-op push. Every read fails closed -- an unreadable body or issue reds
the check naming the read as the cause, re-runnable -- because a lane that passes
on "nothing found" after reading nothing is the polarity `Screenshot Evidence`
already had to fix once. The step keeps the runner's default `bash -e` and takes
every verdict-bearing exit status (an API read, the grammar script) through `if`,
so `-e` can only stop the step on a genuine bug, never skip the 404 or
read-failure branch. The body is untrusted author input and only ever reaches the
grammar script on stdin.

**Two exemptions, both visible in the run log.** The `dependabot[bot]` author is
skipped with a notice: its PRs are generated from a manifest and have no issue to
point at. `github-actions[bot]` is deliberately not exempted: this repository
leaves "Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests" off (see
`test-durations.yml`), so no PR can carry that author and an arm for it would be
dead code claiming coverage. The `issue-gate: waived`
label, applied by a maintainer, is the manual override: it waives the requirement
with a WARNING, whatever the issue's labels say. A maintainer uses it for a
`tier:T3` / `tier:T4` issue nobody has read yet, an unsized issue, a fork PR the
maintainers want through, a production fire (whose issue is written once the fire
is out) and a release PR -- the version-drop and
CHANGELOG-section PRs that [release](../build/release.md) describes, which are
maintainer work with no tracking issue. There is no self-service body marker:
unlike the screenshot waiver, the whole point of this gate is that someone other
than the author agreed to the work, so the override has to be a maintainer
action (only a user with triage rights can apply a label).

**Not a goal here, and what a stall looks like.** An issue is expected to get its
tier from the Captain's scan soon after it is filed. One that sits with no tier,
or a `tier:T3` / `tier:T4` one that sits in `pending-triage`, is a defect in the
Captain or its hand-off, to be reported as such; it is never a reason to pick the
issue up unsized, and the gate deliberately has no "silence means yes"
fallback. Nothing in this repository alarms on that overdue state yet -- the
crew runs outside `.github/`, and an in-repo overdue sweep is a separate
change, filed as [#16308](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/issues/16308).
Until it lands, a stalled crew is visible as PRs red on "no tier label" or
"still waiting for a person"; the maintainer's per-PR fallback is the
`issue-gate: waived` label, and a run of those waivers is the signal to go fix
the crew, not to loosen the gate. The cost this puts on a drive-by contributor
-- a one-line fix waits on a tier too -- is accepted by the maintainer as the
price of the rule (decided in
[#16064](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/issues/16064)); a lighter path
for trivial fixes is a policy change to propose on an issue, not a waiver to add
here.

**Issue-less PR shapes this repository produces, and their path through the
gate.** A `deferred-finding` issue filed from an accept-and-defer disposition
needs no extra label: once the gate is on, the Captain tiers it like any other
untiered issue and the follow-up PR can pass. The three pull requests scheduled workflows
generate -- `test-durations.yml` (`chore(test): refresh .test_durations`),
`add-contributor.yml` (`docs: add new contributors to README`) and
`memory-benchmark.yml` (`chore(bench): accept new memory-benchmark baseline`) --
are opened by a maintainer from a compare link, so their author is human and no
bot exemption applies; each generated body and each compare-link notice now
carries `Part of #16362`, the standing tracking issue for workflow-generated PRs,
so the gate passes mechanically once that issue is tiered. The release
version-drop PR uses the waiver label, above.

**Known residual.** The gate judges the declared issue when a PR event runs it.
An issue that is closed as not planned, or loses its tier or `triaged` label, after the PR's
last `opened` / `synchronize` / `reopened` / `edited` / `labeled` / `unlabeled` event
and before merge is not re-read: no issue-side event re-runs a `pull_request`
lane, and `pr-readiness-sweep.yml` re-fires the readiness recompute, not the
lanes. Both reversals are deliberate maintainer writes that no workflow in
`.github/` performs, the window closes on any PR activity, and the remedy is a
revert; an issue-side revalidation lane (a reverse index from issue to the open
PRs declaring it, plus a write path to re-dispatch their gate runs) would exist for
this path alone and is not built.

## `code-review.yml`: the deterministic pre-gate

No model, no secrets, so it is safe on forks and always runs. It is the grep-half
of the AUTOSDE rules; the semantic half is delegated to the line reviewers.

- **`autosde-rules`** blocks unambiguous frontend violations on added lines: an
  inline `<svg viewBox>` outside brand-mark components (`KiroGhost.tsx`, `*Logo.tsx`,
  `*Ghost.tsx`), a `<div>`/`<span>` with `onClick` and no `role`, `.innerHTML =`,
  Mermaid `securityLevel: 'loose'`, and an oversized `max-w-[>=900px]` page wrapper.
  It also blocks three backend keystones: a sensitive credential or keystone path
  read that does not go through `is_sensitive_path()`, `denied_commands.json`
  dropping off `security._SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` or the governance boot-integrity
  tuple, and a bare `bool()` on an operator-editable boolean opt-out field
  (`bool("false")` is truthy, which would silently disable every protection).
  Advisory warnings, which never fail: unsanitized `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`,
  hardcoded Tailwind colors, new CSS `@keyframes`, sub-10px text.
- **`inclusive-language`** runs a SHA-pinned `woke` (`WOKE_VERSION`, fetched through `get-woke`) over added lines only, failing on `(error)` severity findings; grepping the terms in `.woke.yml` is NOT equivalent to the gate, and an intentional term is exempted with `# wokeignore:rule=<term>` **on the offending line itself** — `woke` matches per line, so a marker on its own line exempts nothing and leaves the gate red (see the markers beside `master_fd` in `dashboard/handlers/terminal.py`). <!-- wokeignore:rule=master --> Legacy violations are burned down separately; this stops
  new ones.
- **`sast`** runs Semgrep in a pinned container: first `semgrep --test` over the
  custom rules in `semgrep/` against the annotated fixtures in `semgrep-tests/`
  (both directions — a `ruleid:` line must match, an `ok:` line must not — so a
  rule regression goes red here, not on a later unrelated PR; the rules dir is
  non-hidden because semgrep 1.78's test mode cannot discover tests under a
  hidden directory), then the scan itself, diff-only against the base,
  community packs plus `semgrep/`, with `--error`. The fixtures are listed in
  `.semgrepignore` so the deliberately vulnerable fixture code is never read by
  the scan. Blocking.
- The production dependency audit (`dependency-vulnerability.yml`, which runs
  `scripts/check_npm_audit.py` over every lockfile-backed Node project and fails
  closed on **high or critical production** vulnerabilities) is **not** a PR
  job. It reaches the npm registry, whose slow hours made it the one red X on
  otherwise-green PRs and then failed nightlies for hours at a stretch. It runs
  where a vulnerable dependency would actually ship: before every release build,
  and — since main carries no dependency gate of its own — before every nightly
  **publish**. On the nightly it gates the publish jobs only, never the builds,
  so a slow registry delays publication of an already-built nightly instead of
  failing the build. Time-boxed exceptions live in
  `.vulnerability-exceptions.json`, and a registry stall or connection fault is
  retried inside one shared time budget before it fails (see the
  transient-failure contract in the security spec).
- **`pr-hygiene`** enforces a Conventional-Commits PR title (it becomes the
  squash-merge message), at most two commits (`git rev-list --count <= 2`), and a
  `## Pattern harvest` section on `fix`/`revert` PRs containing either
  `Rule candidate:` or `Not generalizable:`. One commit stays the norm; the second
  is there so a mechanical follow-up (a regenerated artifact, a formatting sweep)
  can stay separable from the change it accompanies. It also runs
  `.github/scripts/pr-description-check.sh`, the same rules `fork-pr-description.yml`
  applies to forks: the template's required headings, `## Not a goal` included, and
  a filled `**Goal:**` line under Problem / Motivation. On failure its error
  annotation names the missing parts and the fix (rebuild from the template,
  save the description, no push), and the step writes the full steps to the job
  summary. All four checks are blocking.

Separately, **`dependency-review.yml`** fails a PR that adds or changes a
dependency whose license is off the curated allowlist in
`.github/dependency-review-config.yml`. A maintainer can bypass it for the commit
they reviewed with the `license-override` label, honored **only** on the `labeled`
event, so a later push arrives as `synchronize` and re-runs the gate; a new,
unvetted dependency cannot ride in on a stale override.

**`docker-smoke.yml`** is paths-filtered to the container surface (`docker/**` plus
the three source files the container contract spans: the bind override in
`dashboard/origin.py`, the probe Host-barrier exemption in `dashboard/server.py`,
and the liveness payload in `dashboard/handlers/core.py`). It builds the image from
a locally-built wheel and proves, across a real container boundary, that
`KIROCREW_BIND=0.0.0.0` makes the gateway reachable from the host, that token auth
still guards the API on that non-loopback path, that `/api/health` works (the image
HEALTHCHECK depends on it), that kiro-cli runs inside the image, and that channel
credentials passed as container env are moved into the data home's `.env` and
scrubbed from every long-lived process environ.

**`crew-image-build.yml`** runs `docker build` for the AWS Control crew images, which
nothing did before: `backend-test-crew-container` imports the image's Python modules and
runs them on the HOST, so the recipes that merged in #9223 each named a producer script
that was not in the tree and every check stayed green — the image could not be built from
a clean checkout, and no gate said so.

It does not name the two recipes. `scripts/crew_image_build_plan.py` asks the tree which
`Dockerfile*` exist under the crew runtime directory and derives each one's role and
producer from the recipe's own text — a pre-`FROM` `ARG` interpolated by the `FROM` is a
digest-pinned layer, a concrete `FROM` is a base, and the producer is the `scripts/*.sh`
the recipe cites — then refuses anything it cannot account for, including a `FROM` that
interpolates an out-of-scope `ARG` and would silently expand to an empty string. So a
third recipe added later is built or reds the lane, rather than being as uncovered as
these two were. `test_crew_image_build_plan.py` holds the cheap half of that reasoning on
every pull request with no Docker at all.

The crew layer's base is referenced by digest, and only a push produces a repository
digest, so the lane runs a throwaway `registry:2` on `127.0.0.1`: real digest, no
credentials, and therefore runnable on a fork PR with no secrets. It is paths-filtered to
the crew runtime subtree, the producers and the wheel-packaging manifests, and carries a
weekly `schedule` because that path set cannot be complete — the build reaches Debian,
PyPI and the pinned kiro-cli tarball. Measured cold: ~100 seconds of build for a 1.5 GB
image. Like `docker-smoke.yml` it is absent from `pr-readiness.yml`'s lane list: that file
resolves lanes by workflow file and a lane reading "(not started)" freezes the verdict at
pending, which a paths-filtered lane would do on most PRs.

## The AI review ladder

Five reviewers, each with a distinct question and a distinct trust posture. The
design axis is **what each is allowed to read** (its prompt-injection surface) and
**whether it can block**.

| Reviewer | Check name | Harness | Reads | Question | Blocks? |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Opus 5.5 | `Opus 5.5 Review` | Agentic Opus 5.5 with Sonnet 5.5 as the overload fallback, `--max-turns 180` per stage, **two real invocations** (discovery -> validation) | **Code only, and no shell**: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`. The diff is prefetched to a file, so `Bash(gh pr diff:*)` is not granted -- its prefix match also admits `gh pr diff <n> > <path>`, which a directive in the PR-authored diff could use to overwrite the stage-2 prompt | Line-level correctness, security, AUTOSDE | Yes, fail-closed |
| GPT 6.1 | `GPT 6.1 Review` | Non-agentic, **two GPT invocations** (discovery, then authoritative falsification), `reasoning_effort: medium`, plus conditional Opus 5.5 adjudication of blocking candidates | Code plus PR title and body as nonce-wrapped **UNTRUSTED** context | Line-level second perspective, plus description-versus-diff consistency (advisory) | Yes, fail-closed |
| Design Review | `Design Review` | Agentic Opus 5.5, with Sonnet 5.5 as the overload fallback | **Code only, and no shell**: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`. The diff and the PR title/description are prefetched to the data files `authentic.patch` and `pr-intent.txt`, so no `Bash(...)` is granted -- every such grant is prefix-matched, so one admits `<verb> ... > <path>`, which a directive in the PR-authored diff could use to overwrite this job's own inputs | Should we build this, and is it the right *shape*? | Advisory; red only on a genuine `BLOCK` |
| UX Review | `UX Review` | Agentic Opus 5.5, with the same fallback; **two real invocations** on same-repo PRs (blind read -> reconcile) | Pass 1: the PR's screenshots **only** -- the attachments its body links, downloaded, plus any committed image; pass 2: **no shell** (`Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`), reading pass 1's report plus the prefetched `authentic.patch` and `pr-intent.txt` | Can a first-time user who has read nothing tell what each new element is and does, and do state changes stay one continuous element? | Advisory; red only on a genuine `BLOCK` |
| First Principles | `First Principles Review` | Agentic Opus 5.5, same fallback, `--max-turns 120` (inventorying and counting is grep-heavy) | **The whole repository, and no shell**: `Read`, `Grep`, `Glob`. The diff and the PR title/description are prefetched to `authentic.patch` and `pr-intent.txt`, for the same prefix-match reason as the rows above | What is the author trying to do, and does each thing this ships *deserve to exist*, already exist, or only patch a symptom? | Advisory; red only on a genuine `BLOCK` |

### The description a verdict read, and the digest that names it

Every lane whose model judges the author's stated intent reads the title and
description from ONE shared capture, `.github/scripts/pr-description-capture.sh`,
sourced by `design-review`, `ux-review`, `first-principles-review` and their three
fork counterparts. The capture runs once per job, writes `pr-intent.txt`, and the
prompt points the model at that file and at nowhere else.

It is one script rather than a copy per lane because each lane stamps the digest of
those bytes into its published verdict, under a `### Description read` heading:

    [DESCRIPTION-READ] <sha256>

What that digest is taken over depends on whether the lane's verdict reads anything
besides the prose, and the heading says which:

| lanes | the stamp is | why |
|---|---|---|
| `first-principles-review` and its fork twin | `sha256` of `pr-intent.txt` | the verdict reads the prose and the diff, and the diff is pinned to a commit so it cannot move underneath it |
| `design-review`, `ux-review` and their fork twins | `sha256` of a **manifest** naming `pr-intent.txt` and each evidence file the lane's model is pointed at | the media strip replaces every attachment URL with the same placeholder, so swapping one attachment for another leaves the prose byte-identical while the reviewer sees different evidence |

The manifest is one `<label> <sha256>` line per input, newline-terminated, in the
order the lane listed them -- `description`, then `evidence-1`, `evidence-2` and so
on -- so the composition is reproducible by hand and two evidence files cannot be
confused for one longer one. An evidence file whose own bytes are per-run paths is
folded in by its normalized content instead: every line starting with `/` reduced to
its basename, every other line verbatim. That is what makes the manifest reproducible
off the runner at all, since the screenshot list and the rendered-evidence manifest
that embeds it are written as absolute temp paths.

The heading states the evidence count, so a reader knows which of the two forms to
recompute before concluding anything from a mismatch. The recipe at the top of
`pr-description-capture.sh` reproduces the `pr-intent.txt` form; against a lane with
a non-zero count it mismatches by construction rather than because the description
moved.

#### One read per job

The four lanes that stamp a manifest read that description twice: once in the
evidence step, through `.github/scripts/pr-attachment-evidence.sh`, and once in
the capture step. While each script fetched the API itself, a description edited
between the two steps paired the OLD attachments with the NEW prose, and the
manifest digest was taken over that pair -- a revision that never existed,
reported to a reader recomputing it as a match. No later run corrected it,
because the lanes fire on `opened, synchronize, reopened` and a description edit
starts none. The window was ordinary: pushing a commit starts the run, and
pasting a screenshot in the next minute lands inside it.

`.github/scripts/pr-body-snapshot.sh` is now the only place either script reaches
the API. It fetches the whole pull request once, splits the title and the body out
of that one response, and caches them under `$RUNNER_TEMP`; whichever consumer
runs first pays the read and the other reads those same bytes. Keying the cache to
`$RUNNER_TEMP` makes "one read per job" the default rather than something a lane
has to opt into, so a lane added later inherits it without wiring. A *later* job
still reads afresh, which is what keeps a re-run after an edit judging the new
text. The composed bytes are unchanged from the two-read form, so a digest
published before this existed still recomputes to the same value.

Two implementations of the media strip or the 8000-byte cap would make the same
digest mean two different things, and a reader recomputing it would get a mismatch
from a description nobody had touched.

The digest covers the bytes the MODEL received -- after the media strip and the cap --
not the raw API body. That is deliberate and it cuts both ways: an edit the strip
erases cannot change the model's input, so it must not move the digest either, or the
stamp would report a description the verdict never saw. What the stamp therefore
answers is one question: has the description changed since this verdict was formed?
A mismatch means any finding drawn from the description is unproven.

Three properties are load-bearing, and each is pinned:

- The digest is taken at CAPTURE time, so it names what the model was given rather
  than whatever the description says when the verdict is published. A publish-time
  digest would match in exactly the window it needs to catch.
- It is a bare 64-character sha256 or the step fails closed. `sha256sum <file>`
  escapes a filename containing a backslash and prefixes the line with one, so the
  digest reads from stdin; a guard that only tested for empty would publish the
  escaped form, which no reader can reproduce.
- The capture step runs BEFORE any `configure-aws-credentials` step in its lane. On a
  same-repo PR the checkout is the merge ref, so a sourced script is the PR's own
  copy; a session assumed earlier persists for every later step.

A read failure is not a missing description. The capture retries three times and then
fails the step, naming the read as the cause, rather than handing the reviewer an
empty file and letting it judge a PR that appears to state no intent.

### Why a first-principles lane is not a second Design Review

Design Review takes the PR's **stated problem as its frame** and judges the shape of
the solution. Two blind spots survive that. The first is **plurality**: a change
with one stated purpose routinely ships several observable differences — a control
that moved, a relabelled button, a flipped default, a new knob, a retry — and only
the one named in the description gets examined. The second is **depth**: a fix aimed
at the symptom the author happened to trip over passes every lane, because each line
is correct, the shape fits and the surface renders.

So this lane is defined by a method rather than a topic. It states the author's
**intent** in one sentence and whether the change is a fix or an addition, then
**inventories** it into the **observable differences** it ships — written the way a
person would notice them, not the way the code expresses them — and runs every
remaining question **per item**:

A new capability is only one of the kinds that count. A **move, reorder or regroup**
is its own item, and it is the kind that goes unexamined most often precisely because
nothing became newly possible, so nothing reads as "added". The same applies to a
rename, a changed default, an added or removed confirmation, a change in what is
visible by default, and a change in when something happens. If the change is a *fix*,
every item that is not the fix is called out as **riding along**.

A move also carries a **higher** bar than an addition, not a lower one: the capability
already existed, so the only harm available is that people could not find it, and the
review must name who was failing and how that is known. "It groups better" is analogy,
and it does not outweigh the relearning cost every existing user pays.

- **Does it deserve to exist?** The zero option (what observably breaks if this item
  ships nothing), the delete option (could the same harm be removed by deleting code
  or a concept instead of adding one), and provenance — is the requirement *derived*
  from a constraint you can point at, or *inherited* from convention, symmetry, "for
  flexibility"? Reasoning by analogy is named and rejected explicitly, because
  analogy is how an unnecessary feature enters a codebase looking reasonable.
- **Does it already exist?** A grep for the mechanism that already does this job. A
  second spelling of one capability is a finding even when no code is duplicated,
  because both spellings must then be maintained and will diverge.
- **Does it fix the cause?** Each item is placed on a named chain — **symptom**
  (patched where it was observed), **mechanism** (the code that produced it), or
  **cause** (the decision or invariant gap that let it misbehave). Symptom-level
  with a reachable in-scope cause is a finding. Generality is then decided by
  *counting* unfixed sibling instances of the same cause, so "this is a point patch"
  has to come with paths.

Three constraints keep it honest:

- **One contract, read from the base ref.** The lenses live in
  `.github/review-prompts/first-principles.md`, and both lanes `git show` it from the
  PR's **base** commit — the same mechanism the Opus lanes use for their two prompts.
  That removes the second copy entirely, and it means a pull request cannot edit the
  reviewer that judges it. A contract *absent* from the base is not an error — it is
  what happens on the pull request that introduces or moves the contract, so the lane
  reports a non-blocking "no contract on the base commit" and produces no verdict. It
  never falls back to the head's copy, because a rename would then let a change hand
  the reviewer its own rubric.
- **Count before you claim.** Every duplication, consumer-count and unfixed-sibling
  finding must state the count and the pattern grepped; an uncounted claim is a
  fabrication and must be dropped. This is what stops the lane drifting into taste.
- **Every suggestion is a subtraction.** It may propose only deletions, shrinks,
  deferrals, or "use the thing that already exists" — it may not even ask for a doc
  or an RFC. A reviewer allowed to propose additions becomes a source of the exact
  surface it exists to remove.
- **The inventory is printed, even on a PASS.** A `PASS` here is a claim about *every*
  item, so the item list is the evidence a human needs to check that claim. This is
  a deliberate divergence from the sibling lanes, whose clean verdict collapses to
  one line.

It runs whenever a diff touches product or CI surface — **including a plain bug
fix**, which is where the root-cause lens earns the most. Only a change that ships
no capability at all (docs, tests, screenshots, generated files) skips, so the
Opus 5.5 spend goes to diffs that can actually produce a finding.

A `BLOCK` here fails the lane's own check and `pr-readiness.yml` scores that failure as
a readiness blocker, exactly as it does for Design Review and UX Review. Every other
outcome -- `PASS`, `CONCERNS`, an errored or verdict-less run -- exits 0.

Two of its `BLOCK` triggers are read off the evidence rather than judged, so the
"prefer `CONCERNS`" tie-breaker does not reach them:

- **Product shape needs a recorded decision (lens 9).** An item that changes a
  default, changes what a first-class loop, monitor, agent, skill or command does by
  default, or removes or replaces an existing user-facing capability, must trace to a
  decision the repository already recorded: an RFC under `docs/request-for-change/`
  that the **base** commit carries with one of exactly four statuses -- `accepted`,
  `in-progress`, `partial`, `implemented`, the directory README's vocabulary for
  "design agreed"; `draft`, `superseded` and any undefined value are not a decision,
  so the set is closed and nothing fails open -- and a `partial` RFC main deliberately
  diverged from does not cover the diverged shape; or a maintainer's
  `/ai-review override first-principles <head>`
  on that head. The override is consumed by the same-repo lane only: the fork lane
  re-rolls instead, which cannot clear a trigger read off the base RFC list, so on a
  fork PR the remedies are merging the RFC first or a maintainer pushing the branch to
  this repository. The workflow writes the RFC status list from the base sha in the same
  step that extracts the contract, so a PR cannot record its own decision by flipping
  `status:` or shipping the RFC beside the change -- both read as `draft`. That base sha
  is the one the triggering event recorded, and a bare re-run reuses it: once the RFC has
  merged, the author pushes a commit (or rebases) to have the lane read a base that
  carries it -- a re-run alone cannot clear (c). Missing
  both: `BLOCK`, punchline `product-shape change without accepted RFC`. This is not
  the lane asking for a document (which it may not do); it reports that a required
  record is absent and names the two ways it gets made. This is also the First
  Principles lane's *cannot evaluate*: the recorded decision is the one piece of
  evidence this lane requires and cannot produce itself (consumer counts it greps for
  under lens 5; a decision it may not make), so its absence on a product-shape item is
  the verdict the lane cannot reach, and it is never `CONCERNS`. A shape an accepted
  RFC already licenses is not relitigated by asking for its grounds. An ordinary fix
  with thin provenance stays where it was: an `inherited` item, `CONCERNS`.

A third trigger is read off the diff too: **a deleted pin is a prior decision, and
silence about it is the same case as mislabelling it.** When the diff deletes or
rewrites a test, an assertion or a comment that pinned the *opposite* behaviour and
stated why, and the PR shows no evidence the pin was wrong -- no git history, no pin
message, no linked issue -- its framing is contradicted by the diff whether the
description calls the pin "a gap" or never mentions it at all. Symmetry or
consistency with a sibling is not that evidence. Before this clause, only the
mislabelled form reached `BLOCK`; a pin deleted without a word slipped to the
advisory tier as `undeclared` (#10119 deleted a comment reading "This deliberately
supersedes the earlier ... pill spec" plus its pin tests, said nothing, and drew
`CONCERNS`).

**Each finding is stated once.** The lane's output is the verdict header, one bold
punchline that opens with the problem, a `### Not justified as shipped` list, the
collapsed inventory, and -- on `BLOCK` only -- `### Blockers`. Every item that is not
`justified` gets exactly one entry in that list, carrying a `Subtraction:` line where
one exists and its own `Clears when:` line last (the kirocrew-prepare-pr extractor reads from
`Clears when:` to the end of the item as the clearance); there is no `### Watch` and
no `### Subtractions`. Those two sections used to restate the same items a second and
third time (on #10119: three items, three sections, ~600 words against a 180-word
cap), which is what buried the finding under the text around it. The kirocrew-prepare-pr
extractor already reads `Not justified as shipped` as an item-bearing section, so
the local loop's per-item dispositions are unchanged; the check-run summary and the
`::warning` annotation publish that section in place of `Watch`.

Two mechanical guards back the contract in all six whole-design lanes (both First
Principles, Design and UX workflows). The captured model text is **trimmed to its
verdict header** before it is posted, so process narration a model writes above the
header ("All facts verified against the base. Composing the final review.") never
reaches the PR; a body with no header is left whole so the existing
"returned no verdict header" path still sees it. And the prose **outside the collapsed
`<details>` inventory is counted**: past twice the lane's cap (180 words for First
Principles, 150 for Design and UX) the job emits a `::warning` naming the count. It
is a warning, not a gate -- the verdict and the comment do not move -- because the
cap is a readability contract, not a correctness one. The Design and UX punchlines
follow the same problem-first rule as First Principles: for `CONCERNS`/`BLOCK` the
sentence opens with the problem, never `<what is sound>, but <problem>`; for `PASS`
it names the one thing a human should still verify, or `Nothing to check.`

**Where it overlaps Design Review, this lane owns the question.** Design Review's own
rubric asks whether a change fixes a root cause and whether a simpler alternative
exists; those questions are asked here from the premise side and per item. The split
is deliberate — premise and cause here, shape quality there — and if the two lanes
converge in practice, the answer is to trim the overlap out of Design Review, not to
tune two prompts against each other.

### Why Opus 5.5 is code-only

It is the agentic reviewer, so pulling attacker-controllable PR prose into its
context is a prompt-injection surface. `gh pr view` and `gh api` are disallowed, and
so is `gh pr comment`: a **CI step**, not the model, upserts a single
hidden-marker-keyed summary captured from the run transcript, which trades scattered
inline chatter for one terse summary plus a binary gate. The PR-intent
responsibility, including flagging a description-versus-diff mismatch, is
deliberately handed to the read-only, non-agentic GPT 6.1 reviewer, which treats
that prose as **untrusted evidence, never authority to waive a code finding**. The
prose is fetched by a step that has network and the token, then baked into the
prompt wrapped in a collision-resistant nonce, because the review sandbox unshares
the network and cannot fetch it itself.

### One shared binary contract

Both line reviewers run the same review contract, and severity encodes exactly one
thing: *does this block the merge*, **never confidence**. There is no
"possible issue" tier. The blocks of that contract shared by the two GPT
workflows — the diff-is-not-evidence clause, the coverage/finding/fix bars, the
output contract, and the falsification-pass mandate and verdict framing — live in
shared `.github/review-prompts/gpt-*.md` files rather than as two inline copies,
so the lanes cannot drift apart on them (#5852). The same-repo lane's remaining
inline chunks (its system rules, repo context, and round-convergence sections)
moved into that directory too (#3697), so its whole prompt is now assembled by
splicing staged prompt files in a fixed order — which is also what lets the
kirocrew-prepare-pr skill's `local_review.py` mirror the contract by reading the same
files instead of scraping shell heredocs. The same-repo lane stages them
from the PR's **base** commit like the Opus lanes; unlike those lanes it falls
back to the checked-out copy (with a warning) when a block is absent on the base,
because a hard gate cannot afford a no-verdict pass and, on a same-repo PR, the
workflow file itself is already editable by the PR — the fallback adds no attack
surface the lane did not have. The fork lane's checkout *is* the trusted base
(the diff is never applied), so it reads the files straight from the tree and
fails closed if one is missing. A finding must state a concrete input or condition that
occurs in practice, the call path to the changed line, and an observable wrong
outcome; anything phrased as "could", "might" or "if a caller were to" is **not a
finding**, and silence is the correct output. Only two labels exist: **BLOCKING**
(on the closed WHAT BLOCKS list) and **FINDING** (advisory, never blocks). A
per-review budget caps a review at 2 BLOCKING findings, and the calibration note
says "No findings." is the expected output for a typical PR.

### Asymmetric multi-pass is intentional

BOTH line reviewers now run **two real invocations**: a discovery pass that
generates candidates, then an **authoritative falsification** pass whose primary
job is to *kill* them. The Opus lane used to run one pass with two internal phases; that
was measured on this repo to suppress findings the same model reports reliably
without the precision clauses, because a prompt asked to discover AND to police
its own precision stops discovering. Its discovery half therefore carries no
precision gates, and its validation half applies a confidence floor and the closed
blocking list. A
candidate survives only if pass 2 re-derived the input, the call path and the
observable outcome itself from code it opened in that pass. Pass 2 may also *add* a
defect discovery missed, in both lanes, but only under that same three-part
grounding and the same confidence floor — killing a candidate stays its primary
job, and a self-found finding gets no second opinion, so it earns no cheaper path
in. In both lanes such a finding is tagged `(origin: validation)` in the posted
review, because it is un-falsified by construction: the tag is what lets a reader
weight it accordingly, and what lets the precision of self-added findings be
compared against survivors' rather than assumed equal. Pass 2 is the only
gated verdict. Falsification raises precision *within a single run*, which is why
neither reviewer carries cross-round state: each judges only the current SHA's code
and therefore cannot contradict itself across rounds.

### Verdicts are structured markers

The markers are the **only** gate:

- Opus 5.5 emits `[OPUS-REVIEWED] <sha>` always, and `[BLOCK-MERGE] <sha>` only when a
  blocking finding exists. Both are parsed out of the action's `execution_file`
  transcript rather than a `--json-schema` structured output, because the harness's
  internal structured-output tool is unreliable when other tools are enabled:
  reviews completed with a success result yet returned no structured output,
  failing this gate closed on healthy reviews.
- GPT 6.1 emits `[GPT-REVIEWED] <sha>` / `[BLOCK-MERGE] <sha>`. When the provider
  *refuses* the request — declines to review the diff because of what it contains,
  as opposed to crashing or timing out — the **same-repo lane** publishes a distinct
  terminal state: the synthetic verdict body names the refusal in prose (no
  reviewed marker, so the gate still fails closed), and the classification rides
  the verdict assembly's `refused` step output. There is deliberately no refusal
  marker in the body — the body on the clean path is model prose, and a marker
  would invite prose-grepping, so a review that merely quotes the refusal wording
  cannot be reclassified. The gate's message names human adjudication
  (`/ai-review override`) instead of advising a re-run: the refusal is caused by
  the reviewed content and is empirically sticky — 12 consecutive identical
  refusals across 10 heads were measured on one PR — so a re-run is not a workable
  remedy. A failed pass is classified as refused only when the provider's own
  error line appears line-anchored in the tail of that pass's captured stream,
  because the stream also carries PR-controlled text (the prompt embeds the PR
  title/body, and the reviewer echoes the diff). Without the distinction, every
  security fix whose evidence is a working exploit read as a permanently
  re-runnable crash (#8685). The fork GPT lane (`fork-gpt-review.yml`) still
  reports only the generic incomplete state and is tracked separately.
- Design and UX emit `Design-Verdict:` / `UX-Verdict: PASS | CONCERNS | BLOCK`,
  parsed from a header line.

A missing reviewed-marker for the current head fails the gate closed, because a
no-output review must not look clean. A BLOCKING-labelled finding without the
`[BLOCK-MERGE]` marker is only a non-gating **advisory warning**, since a coherence
check on that pairing mis-fires whenever the model quotes prior text.

The Opus discovery pass has its own marker, `[OPUS-DISCOVERY] <sha>`, and the
`Capture discovery candidates` step fails closed when it is absent, before
validation runs. That branch keeps its existing `::error::` line and `exit 1`, and
in addition prints one `::notice::discovery-capture-diagnostics` line. The line
carries fixed keys only: the execution file's shape (`absent`, `empty`, `array`,
`object`, `jsonl`, `other`, `unparseable`), the captured byte count, how many
transcript messages carry a `result`, the number of `compact_boundary` system
messages, the number of permission denials, that same number split by the
denied tool (`denied_read`, `denied_grep`, `denied_glob`, `denied_bash`, each an
exact `tool_name` match, and `denied_other` for every other name, a missing or
non-string name, or a malformed entry; the five sum to `permission_denials` and
no recorded name is ever echoed), whether the full marker appears in at least
one assistant `text` block of the transcript (`marker_in_assistant`), and four
measurements of the text the extraction itself produced before
redaction: its character count, and whether the full marker, a short-SHA marker
or the literal `<HEAD_SHA>` placeholder appears in it. That text is the shell
variable the marker grep was fed, so on a JSONL transcript it is every record's
`.result` concatenated and a non-string result is the JSON `jq -r` rendered,
exactly as the candidate file sees them. It reaches jq over stdin, never as a
process argument. Each value is a count, a boolean or one word from a closed
set, validated by shape before it is echoed; a file jq cannot parse yields
`unparseable` and `unknown` transcript counts, never jq's error text. Counts
that come from `wc` are stripped of the padding BSD `wc` (macOS) adds before
they are echoed, so every token on the line is one `key=value` pair on every
platform. A `true` full-marker value on this branch means the capture, not the
model, lost the marker (the redactor rewrote it). A `true` `marker_in_assistant`
with a `false` full-marker value means a scanned assistant text block contains
it but the extracted result does not. It does not establish message order or
prove review completeness. `false` says only that no scanned `text` block
carried it. In both cases the
gate still fails and nothing lifts a marker out of an earlier message. A
`compact_boundaries` of `0` means no `compact_boundary` message was observed in
the file; it is not proof of anything the transcript does not record. The
success path still prints the redacted candidate file as a tuning signal, as
before; the failing branch prints no transcript or candidate content, and neither
path uploads the execution file.
`test_ai_review_workflows.py::TestOpusDiscoveryCaptureExecutes` runs the real
step against fixtures that plant sentinel strings in the tool arguments, denied
tool names, tool results and the model's text, and asserts none reach stdout or
stderr; one case runs the step with a `wc` shim that pads like BSD `wc` and
asserts the line still parses one token per key. The same block runs verbatim in
`fork-opus-review.yml` as trusted workflow text; it never executes a helper from
the fork's tree.

What the first diagnostics line said. On
[PR #10586](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/pull/10586) the same-repo
discovery pass lost its marker at two heads
([run 34787154779](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/actions/runs/34787154779),
[run 34791198099](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/actions/runs/34791198099)).
Observed on the second: `exec_file=array captured_bytes=294 result_messages=1
extracted_chars=293 marker_in_extracted=false short_sha_marker_only=false
placeholder_marker=false compact_boundaries=0 permission_denials=4`, with a
result message reporting 19 turns and `is_error: false`. The extraction selected
the one result message the transcript had; that message did not contain the
marker; the redactor did not rewrite one. The capture is not where the marker
went. What the 293 characters said, and which four tool calls were denied, is
not observable from that run, by design; the per-tool denial counts exist so
the next occurrence answers the second question. The two marker-less passes
were also the two with the largest prefetched diffs on that PR (996,100 and
1,093,568 bytes against 466,134 to 778,441 bytes for the passes that produced
the marker) and the fewest turns (19 against 26 to 62). That is a correlation
across two heads, not a mechanism: the diagnostics do not measure what the
model read or how much context it used, and this page does not claim the diff
exceeded the model's context. The prompt
(`.github/review-prompts/opus-discovery.md`, read from the base commit, so a PR
cannot change the prompt that reviews it) defines two output shapes, a
candidate list or `No candidates.`, each ending in the marker and each described
as the product of inspecting every hunk; a pass that stops short of that has no
conforming shape. A short free-text final message is one hypothesis consistent
with these numbers, and it is unconfirmed. No reading of the diagnostics line
changes the verdict.

A lane's summary comment is **one slot shared by every run on the PR**, and it
is upserted in place. The comments API has no `If-Match`, so a write to that
slot is last-writer-wins, and it exposes no edit history, so the loss is
undetectable afterwards: a failed run's "review incomplete" body once replaced
a posted verdict and a `[BLOCK-MERGE]` finding vanished from every surface a
reader or tool checks (#8292).

Eight of the ten lanes that upsert a verdict comment now let exactly one kind of
run claim that slot — a **completed verdict for the PR's current head**. The two
other kinds each lose a live verdict, so each leaves an existing comment
untouched (#8344):

- **No `"<stamp> <head>"` proof marker** — a review failure. Preserving the
  verdict and prepending a staleness notice is *not* a safe alternative: it
  reads the body and writes a merge of it back, so a verdict published between
  the read and the write is restored away.
- **A completed verdict for a superseded head** — the same loss arriving late.
  An older run can finish after a newer one published, because the fork lanes'
  `concurrency` group is keyed per head so they are not cancelled, and a
  cancelled same-repo run still executes its `if: always()` posting step. The
  step reads the PR's head and stands down when it is not the head it
  reviewed.
- **A head that cannot be read.** Writing is the destructive half of the
  guard, so it does not proceed on an unknown: a head unreadable after three
  attempts is *not confirmed current* and the slot is left alone. The read
  retries first — with the same bounded backoff this lane's other gating reads
  use — because one blip is not evidence about the PR, and an API broken
  enough to fail all three would fail the write too.

Whether a comment exists is the other gating input, so that read retries on the
same bounded backoff. A lookup still erroring afterwards counts as "a comment
may exist", not as "none does", so a withheld run posts nothing rather than
plant a second marker comment over a possibly-live verdict. When the lookup
succeeded and found nothing there is no verdict to lose, so the body is posted
as a new comment. Nothing is lost by standing down: the comment names the head
it reviewed, each head's own check-run is finalized fail-closed, and
`pr_status.py` matches reviewer stamps against the current head, so a comment
left in place for an older head reads as *stale* and never as an approval of
this one.

Human overrides and skip notices are current-head determinations rather than
review failures, so their upsert sites keep replacing the comment
unconditionally, and a completed verdict for a **confirmed** current head whose
*comment* lookup failed still CREATEs rather than stay silent (a duplicate
comment is recoverable, an unposted verdict is not). The eight guarded lanes
define the guard as a `guarded_comment_upsert` bash function that
`test_ai_review_workflows.py` pins byte-identical across every lane, so the
invariant cannot drift lane by lane.

Two lanes stay outside that function, and both exclusions are deliberate:

- **`codex-review.yml`** carries #8342's own inline preserve-and-prepend shape,
  pinned byte-for-byte by its own tests — it is the one site left with a
  read-modify-write window on the slot.
- **`claude-review.yml`** keeps a plain lookup-then-PATCH. Its incomplete path
  posts **nothing at all**, so the #8292 class — a failure notice burying a
  verdict — cannot reach it. What remains is only the superseded-completed
  window: its `concurrency` group cancels an older run per PR, but the posting
  step is `if: always()`, which a cancelled run still executes, so an older run
  holding a completed verdict can still claim the slot.

### Security posture of the reviewer jobs

- Explicit fork guards (`head.repo.full_name == github.repository`) on **every
  step**, so on a fork the job starts and then does nothing rather than failing an
  unsatisfiable credential step. The guard is per-step and not job-level because
  GitHub never evaluates a **skipped** job's `name:` -- while it was job-level,
  every fork PR published the raw name expression as its check name. Fork coverage
  still comes from the separate `fork-*` pipeline below.
- **The job name is conditional on the head repository**, so a fork PR gets
  `<check> (same-repo lane, not applicable to forks)` instead of the protected
  name. Same-repo PRs keep the exact protected name. Without this, both lanes
  publish one name and GitHub resolves a required status check to the **newest**
  check-run of that name: a `pull_request` event firing after the fork lane
  posted its verdict (a reopen, or an `edited` title/body on `codex-review.yml`)
  would make the same-repo lane's own run the newest one and satisfy the
  gate on a review that never ran. `pr-readiness.yml` was never fooled by this
  -- for a fork it reads only the check-runs bound to this PR and attempt by
  `external_id` and treats "no completed bound run" as pending -- so the rename
  closes the branch-protection half of the gate.
- `persist-credentials: false` on checkout, so `actions/checkout` never writes the
  token into `.git/config` where a reviewer reading untrusted PR content could find
  it.
- AUTOSDE rules are extracted from the **base** commit, not the PR head, so a PR
  cannot weaken the rules that govern it.
- Bedrock credentials are assumed late, after dependency installation, so a
  compromised or version-drifted release never observes them.
- The GPT reviewer runs in a read-only, network-unshared sandbox (which is why the
  job clears `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` first: the sandbox's
  bubblewrap fails at netns setup otherwise).
- Review output is redacted for AWS key ids, ARNs, 12-digit account numbers and
  secret-key or session-token shapes before any public comment.
- Dependabot PRs skip the review work and let the gate pass, since they run with a
  read-only token and no credential access.
- A lane's job timeout is a runaway backstop, not a review budget: 30 to 160
  minutes, sized per lane off its turn budget so a healthy review self-terminates
  well before it, so the timeout exists solely to fail the gate closed on a true
  hang. The Opus lanes sit at 120, because both of their stages share one job and
  the wall therefore bounds their sum.

### Advisory means advisory, with one exception

Design Review and UX Review are advisory except on `BLOCK`: their suggestions must be
proportionate ("never recommend extra layers, abstractions or future-proofing the
problem does not require"), and their tie-breaker is to choose `CONCERNS` over
`BLOCK` when torn, reaching for `BLOCK` only when the **design** or the **experience**
is wrong and never merely because the change is large. A genuine `BLOCK` verdict
fails that workflow's own check and `pr-readiness.yml` scores that failure as a
readiness blocker; every other outcome exits 0.

One class is exempt from the tie-breaker in both lanes and in First Principles:
**a verdict the lane cannot reach because required evidence is missing is a
`BLOCK`, never a `CONCERNS`.** A UI diff with no screenshot of the controls it adds
(UX lens 12), a persistent-element state change with no recording (UX lens 13), a
reshaped user-visible surface the Design reviewer has never seen rendered -- each is
`cannot evaluate: missing <X>`. Filed as `CONCERNS`, an unevaluated change reads as
"looked and found little" and passes readiness green; PR #5185 shipped 44
`website/src/` files that way, with the UX lane itself recording that the blind read
never ran. Absence of evidence is read off the screenshot list, the recording list
and the description, not judged, so it is a fact and the lanes report it as one.
The Design trigger accepts the same evidence the UX lane admits: a
`github.com/user-attachments` asset in the description or an image committed at
HEAD -- and it reads presence the same way. Both Design lanes run a "Collect
rendered evidence" step that sources the shared allowlisted fetch script, downloads
and types every attachment the description offers, lists the committed images the
revision adds or changes (by sourcing `.github/scripts/pr-committed-evidence.sh`,
which reads every blob out of the object store at the head SHA with `git cat-file`
and never off a working tree -- one admission path through one set of gates for a
same-repo PR and a fork PR alike; the two differ only in where the workflow learns
the head SHA), and writes one evidence file the prompt is told to read; the
description's text is not the predicate, so a fabricated or dead URL does not count
as evidence. A transport failure is listed as "presence unconfirmed" and caps the
Design verdict at `CONCERNS` rather than failing the lane, because the UX lane fails
its run on the same failure and readiness already holds. An image hosted off a
commit outside the PR, or one the description says shows another PR, is not evidence
of this revision.

**Design Review checks the readers of anything a PR takes away.** Both Design
lanes run a TAKE-AWAY CHECK: the reviewer lists what the patch removes, renames,
hides, tightens or migrates, greps the tree itself for readers across every entry
point (crew page, chat, subagent, cron, app bundles, prompt builder, release), and
compares them with the description's `## Backwards compatibility` section, where
each reader is one `Reader: <path>:<symbol> -- <entry> -- <why it still works |
test name>` line, or the section is `Removes nothing: <why>`. A reader a
`Breaking:` line names counts as listed and accepted. A reader that breaks under
the patch and is not listed is a `BLOCK` naming it (`Removes nothing` lists no
reader); a listed reader with a weak reason is `CONCERNS`. A reader a `Compatible:` line names by `<path>:<symbol>` counts as
listed too. When a description cut at the capture cap is missing the section, or
the section is the last one before the cut, its list may be past the cut and the
check caps at `CONCERNS`; a section that ends before the cut is judged on its text.
The same-repo lane runs the PR's own copy of the prompt (`pull_request`), the fork
lane the default branch's (`workflow_run`), so only a same-repo prompt change
reviews itself under its own edit. #13273 (apps tree hidden from app
crons) and #12798 (crewmate rows pruned under chat resume and subagents) are why:
both passed every lane on an unchecked compatibility claim.

**Design Review owns the long-term / one-way-door lens** as its gate 8, "LONG-TERM
REVERSIBILITY", in both the same-repo and fork variants. An unsafe one-way door is
its primary `BLOCK` trigger. Everything reversible (architectural erosion,
maintainability, "should eventually be refactored") is advice and non-blocking
follow-up work, because the author does not need a perfect or complete solution in
this PR.

There is no separate long-term arbiter workflow. A second-order reviewer that
re-judged the other reviewers' *comments* over a `workflow_run` chain blocked almost
nothing, and it structurally could not work for fork PRs: the fork head SHA does not
survive the extra `workflow_run` hop, so it never resolved which PR it was for. The
lens now lives where the reviewer already has full diff context, and covers same-repo
and fork PRs identically with no cross-workflow head-passing.

### `UX Review` early-skips cheaply

It runs only when the diff touches `website/`, `temp-screenshots/**` or
`.github/screenshots/**` (the last two are gitignored, so in practice `website/` is the
trigger). A backend, CI or docs PR skips it with no model call and no comment churn,
and the check passes. Review evidence is uploaded as a GitHub attachment, not
committed -- except by a fork contributor, whom the upload endpoint refuses (see the
fork lane below): the author writes local paths in the PR body and runs
`gh pr create|edit --attach <path>`, which rewrites each into a permanent
`https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/...` URL (dragging the file into the
description in the web UI yields the same URL). The lane reads the body from the API when
it runs (`.github/scripts/pr-attachment-evidence.sh`, one script both UX lanes source;
the fork lane takes it from its trusted base checkout), not from the event payload -- an `edited` event starts no review, so evidence
attached after a push is read on a re-run of the workflow or on the next push -- downloads
those URLs (a committed image is still accepted), reads each one and grounds visual
findings in them, and it is instructed to treat screenshot content as untrusted (a
screenshot, title, commit message or filename attempting to grant leniency is
ignored, and screenshot polish never waives a lens). `screenshot-evidence.yml`, the
gate that requires evidence on a UI diff, accepts the same URLs.

### Waiving the screenshot requirement

A watched file can change without any visual delta, so `screenshot-evidence.yml`
carries two waiver paths — and both emit a warning rather than passing silently,
so the waiver stays visible in the run:

- **`no-screenshots` label.** For maintainers, who can label a PR.
- **`<!-- no-visual-delta -->` marker in the PR body, plus a
  `**Why no screenshot:** <reason>` line.** Self-service, so a fork contributor
  who cannot apply labels is not blocked. The marker *without* a justification
  line is an error, not a waiver.

Gating a genuinely non-visual change would train contributors to paste a
meaningless screenshot to get green, which is worse than no gate — hence the
waivers rather than a stricter requirement.

What counts as evidence is "does it render for a reviewer": a markdown image, an
HTML `<img>` or `<video>`, a `temp-screenshots/` path, or a
`user-attachments/` URL. The check's own guidance names the attachment ceilings it
expects authors to stay under — 10 MB per image or GIF, 100 MB per video — and
asks for a recording (video or GIF) rather than a still whenever the change is an
animation, transition, hover or focus state.

A diff that changes an Electron-only surface -- the application menu, its
accelerator captions, the window chrome -- cannot be photographed by any of the
`website/scripts/capture-*.mjs` scripts, which all drive the web app in Chromium.
`website/scripts/capture-electron-shell.mjs` shoots those surfaces by launching
real Electron; the recipe is in
[worktree verification recipes](../guides/worktree-verification-recipes.md).

### `UX Review` reads the screenshots blind before it reads the diff

On same-repo PRs the lane is two model calls with a context wall between them.
**Pass 1 (blind read)** gets the `Read` tool and a list of the images the PR carries
-- the `user-attachments` URLs linked from its body, downloaded to the runner, plus
any image it commits -- copied under opaque names (`shot-01.png`, ...) so an
author-chosen filename such as `pinned-turn-chip.png` cannot prime it -- and nothing
else: no diff, no PR title or description, no `Grep`/`Glob`/`Bash`. It is told it is
a non-technical person opening the product for the first time and
writes down, per element, what it appears to be, what a click would do, how sure it
is, and whether it would dare to click. **Pass 2 (reconcile)** gets the diff, the PR
text and pass 1's report as a data file, and adjudicates rather than re-reads.

Why the wall exists: PR #6783 minimized a banner into a corner chip labelled
"Pinned turn". Every AI lane passed it -- this one wrote that the chip was
"self-teaching ... visibly labelled" -- and the product owner could not tell what the
chip was. A reviewer that has read the diff and the description before it looks at
the pixels has already learned the author's vocabulary; it can check that a label
exists, is localized and is reversible, but it can no longer test whether a stranger
understands it. The old lens 12 ("five-second proxy: imagine an uninformed reader")
asked exactly that of a reviewer that was no longer uninformed, so it was replaced.

Three rules follow from the split, all read off evidence rather than judged:

- **Coverage.** Every user-visible control the diff adds or changes must appear in a
  screenshot the PR carries -- an attachment linked from its body, or a committed
  image. One that does not is an *evidence gap*, listed under
  `### Evidence gaps`, and the verdict is `BLOCK` -- `cannot evaluate: missing <the
  control>` -- because a lane that has not seen a control cannot judge it and a
  verdict it cannot reach must not read as advisory. The same holds for a lens-13
  state change with no recording, and for a blind read not performed because the PR
  supplied no admissible image. A blind read that was *unavailable* -- images admitted
  and pass 1 itself failed -- is the lane's own failure, not the author's gap: it caps
  at `CONCERNS` and a re-run of the workflow is the remedy. When *any* attachment
  download from the description fails for a transport reason (5xx, 403/408/429, no
  answer; a definite 404 is the author's URL), the same-repo evidence step **fails the
  run** instead of asking the prompt to cap the verdict or to exempt the controls that
  attachment would have shown: a lane that could not see everything the author
  supplied must not read as advisory, so the check is red, readiness holds, and a
  re-run is the remedy -- exactly as a hard model-step error is handled. A download
  that fails the same way on the re-run is the attachment URL itself, which the
  author fixes. The fork
  lane holds the same way: its evidence step fails on the same condition and its
  Finalize step completes the check-run as `failure` (an errored fork run would
  otherwise resolve `neutral`, which readiness scores as pass), so a fork UI change
  the lane could not evaluate does not merge on the strength of a throttled asset
  host either; a maintainer re-runs the lane. An image
  the evidence step did not admit (not a `user-attachments` asset, not committed at
  HEAD -- e.g. a raw URL pinned to a commit outside the PR) does not close a gap. A
  diff that adds or changes no user-visible control has no gaps and needs no
  screenshot.
- **Primary controls.** A control on the change's main path that the blind reader
  misread (named a different thing or outcome than the diff implements), could not
  identify, or would not dare to click is a `BLOCK`, quoting the reader's words. A
  correct reading the reader rated only "a guess", secondary misreads, and
  vocabulary collisions ("Pinned turn" next to the existing "Pinned messages") are
  `CONCERNS`.
- **State-transition continuity (lens 13).** When a user action or state flip
  minimizes, collapses, relocates or replaces a *persistent* element the user has
  already identified, the change must animate *one* element between the two states
  (shared layout, a landing spot the eye can follow, continuous text, restore as the
  reverse), respecting `prefers-reduced-motion`. A hard swap in the diff
  (`flag ? <Chip/> : <Card/>`, an unmount/mount with no shared-element transition)
  with no stated reason is a `BLOCK`. Async lifecycle states (loading, empty, error
  -> content) are not in scope. The convention is also stated in `website/AGENTS.md`
  so authors meet it before the check does. Static screenshots cannot show
  continuity, so this class of change needs a recording (a `.gif`/`.mp4`/`.webm`
  attached to the PR body, or committed); none is an evidence gap. The reviewer
  cannot play the recording -- it verifies the mechanism in the diff and that the
  recording exists, and a human watches it.
- **Placement is an app-wide question (lens 0).** Every control, row, page, menu
  entry or setting the diff adds or moves must sit where a user looking for it
  would go first, next to the controls about the same thing -- judged across the
  whole app (settings tabs, sidebar sections, menus, modals, the command palette),
  not within the one panel the screenshot shows. The reviewer names the surface
  that is already about that thing; if one exists and the control is elsewhere,
  that is a finding. A placement defended only by where a reporter, an issue or the
  author asked for it is not a design decision and is itself a finding: a request
  fixes that the control must be reachable, not where it lives. The lens exists
  because PR #12037 put a *billing* opt-in (spend credits to read the balance) on
  Settings > Display, said in a code comment that this was "the reporter's
  placement rather than" a design choice, and every lane passed it: the UX lane
  checked the toggle's look, words and states inside Display and never asked
  whether Display was the page.

The fork lane (`fork-ux-review.yml`) carries the same rules but has **no blind-read
pass**: it reviews in a single pass, after the diff. Its evidence step reads the PR
description from the API and downloads the allowlisted `user-attachments` URLs onto
the runner (the job's egress allowlist names the two hosts a download touches,
`github.com` and the `github-production-user-asset-6210df.s3.amazonaws.com` bucket
its 302 points at), so the reviewer
opens the same images a same-repo review would. Media the fork PR *commits* under
`temp-screenshots/` or `.github/screenshots/` is read too, by
`.github/scripts/pr-committed-evidence.sh`: the blobs come out of the object store
the authentic-diff step already fetched, typed by their bytes and copied under the
same index names, so the fork head is still never checked out as files. That matters
because `gh --attach` is *unavailable* to a fork contributor -- its upload endpoint
answers read permission with a 404 ([cli/cli#14302](https://github.com/cli/cli/issues/14302))
-- leaving them the web-UI drag and the committed path. The script carries its
admission contract in one block at its head: every path the head holds under those
directories is a candidate whatever its diff status, and a screenshot that was only
*moved* from a path the base already held (a `git mv`, status `R100`) is refused by
name and counted, not read -- its bytes show the base's rendering, not this
revision's -- while a moved file whose bytes changed is read like any other. A control
no supplied screenshot shows is still an evidence gap, a `BLOCK` (`cannot evaluate`)
the author closes by attaching *or* committing the image. A control the evidence
*does* show but no blind reader has read caps the fork PR at `CONCERNS`: that is the
lane's limitation, not the author's gap, so it does not block. A maintainer who wants
the blind read pushes the branch to this repository.

**What happens to committed evidence at merge.** It merges. The squash lands the
`temp-screenshots/` files on `main` as tracked files (the ignore rule stops mattering
once a path is tracked) and their blobs in history, and it never does so silently:
they are in the diff the maintainer merges. The merging maintainer then removes them
from the tip in a follow-up `chore(evidence): drop the committed review media of #<n>`
PR (`git rm -r temp-screenshots/<topic>`), so review media does not accumulate on
`main` the way it did before the sweep that emptied the directory. That removal is
the reversible half. The blobs are the irreversible half: a deletion commit leaves
them in every clone's pack, and only a history rewrite -- which that sweep deferred to
a separate, maintainer-approved change -- takes them out. This cost is accepted
because it is bounded: fork PRs are the minority, `pr-committed-evidence.sh` refuses a
file over its size ceiling, and the guidance asks for two or three shots. The
evidence stays readable at the squash commit
(`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/blob/<sha>/temp-screenshots/...`) after the
removal, so the removal PR names that SHA. The why lives with the rule it excepts, in
kirocrew-prepare-pr's `references/rationale.md`.

The PR identity (number, repository, shas, data-file paths) is passed to both passes
in `--append-system-prompt`, not in `prompt:`. GitHub rejects a workflow file
silently (zero jobs, nothing on the PR) when any expression-bearing string exceeds
21000 characters, and the review prompt is past that once it carries these rules, so
`prompt:` must stay expression-free.

### Human override

`ai-review-human-override.yml` lets a repository **writer** record a judgment with:

```
/ai-review override <fable|gpt|design|ux|first-principles|scope|all> <current-head-sha>: <one-sentence reason>
```

A writer's agent running the `kirocrew-prepare-pr` loop may post this command for
a finding it judged a false positive or over-engineering, and must report it
afterwards; it never posts one for a security, data-loss, corruption, crash or
removed-guard finding, which goes to a person. Its reason starts with `agent:`, so
the record still names the writer whose account posted it and accountable for it,
while a reader can tell the agent's call from a person's ruling.

`scope` targets the [Security Scope Review](#security-scope-review-what-a-tightening-newly-refuses) lanes. Each target names a lane by its command spelling, and `pr_status.py` resolves that spelling to a reviewer through the lane's comment key — so `gpt` is the `codex-ai-review` lane's reviewer `GPT`, and `fable` is the `claude-ai-review` lane's reviewer `OPUS`. `scope` is the exception: its lane consumes the record like any other, but it has no reviewer binding, so the script has no row to report it under.

`pr_status.py` reads the marker too, and reports an accepted record as its own row —
`GPT: OVERRIDDEN by @<actor>` — rather than as a fresh stamp. The two markers prove
different things: `[<NAME>-REVIEWED] <sha>` is proof a **model** produced a verdict for
this commit, and the override record is proof a **writer** adjudicated it (in person, or
through their agent with an `agent:` reason) on a path where
the model is deliberately not re-run, so no stamp exists to find. Without that, an
accepted override turns the lane's check green while the canonical script still reports
`stale reviewer stamp(s)` for it. The record must name the head **exactly**: it is written
by the workflow from `.head.sha`, so the prefix-and-elision tolerance that exists for
model-transcribed stamps does not apply. A record naming one lane also keeps that lane in
the evaluation, so deleting the bot comment that carries a stale stamp cannot make the
reviewer disappear from the check instead of answering for it.

`issue_comment` workflows execute from the trusted default branch, never from the PR
head. The handler validates the command shape, a 7-to-40-hex SHA that must be the
**current** head, writer-or-above permission, and a non-empty reason under 500
characters, then posts a **bot-authored** marker comment that the reviewer workflows
trust. Raw PR comments can never turn a gate green directly; only that marker can.
The scope is **this commit only**, so a new push needs a new judgment. The workflow
then re-runs the affected reviewer, cancelling an in-flight run first so its stale
verdict cannot race the human decision. On a fork PR the affected reviewer is the
`workflow_run`-triggered Stage-2 lane, whose run objects are keyed to the default
branch — the handler locates the lane run through the run URL the lane stamps into
the `details_url` of the check-run it posts on the PR head, verifies the resolved
run belongs to the expected fork workflow, and re-runs it. The fork lanes consume
no override marker, so that re-run is a fresh review roll rather than a forced
pass. PR Readiness's supersession gate does read the record, so when that clean
re-roll replaces the BLOCK at the same head, the replaced block counts as
adjudicated rather than dropped (see the supersession bullets under PR
Readiness). A rerun failure after the judgment has recorded is reported as a warning
annotation plus a PR notice naming the lane to re-run manually — never as a failed
run, which would make a recorded judgment look rejected.
`test/test_ai_review_workflows.py` pins the contract from both ends:
`test_handler_requires_write_permission_fresh_sha_and_reason` for the authorization and
freshness checks, and `test_fable_consumes_only_a_bot_authored_sha_scoped_record` plus
`test_gpt_has_clear_verdict_banner_and_human_override` for the consumer side, so an
untrusted PR comment or a decision for an earlier push cannot turn a gate green.

## `Security Scope Review`: what a tightening newly refuses

A security fix is almost always a deny rule made stricter, and "stricter" has a
cost no reviewer sees by reading the pattern: the set of ordinary operations the
tightened rule *also* newly refuses — a read-only `gh` query, a feature-branch
push, an installed cron. This lane names them. It asks one question — which
legitimate operations does this change newly refuse? — and answers it against the
real deny composite at the base ref and at the head ref, on macOS, Linux and
Windows.

It does **not** judge whether the fix is secure enough, and it does not replace
the [denial-differential gate](denial-differential.md). The denial differential
classifies a committed corpus of known golden paths; this lane has a model
**propose** candidate legitimate operations the corpus does not yet name, and
`scripts/deny_diff.py` **decides** each one by classifying it at both refs. Model
proposes, script decides: a candidate is data the classifier reads, never an
operation it runs, so a confirmed regression is the script's finding and never the
model's.

It runs on two surfaces. `.github/workflows/security-scope-review.yml` is the
same-repo lane. `.github/workflows/fork-security-scope-review.yml` gives a fork PR
the same review from the trusted base branch, triggered by the completion of
`Fast Gate` and gated on `head_repository.full_name != github.repository`, and it
posts under the same check name so branch protection is satisfied on either path.

### Scope

The lane runs only when the change touches the security surface: the deny
composite's own modules (`src/kiro_crew/security/`, `src/kiro_crew/hooks.py`,
`src/kiro_crew/hook_runtime/`, `src/kiro_crew/deny_guidance.py`,
`src/kiro_crew/platform/security_authority.py`), the security-conductor's
`rules-of-engagement.json` and `golden-paths.json`, and the lane's own harness
(`scripts/deny_diff.py`, `scripts/scope_candidates.py`, `scripts/scope_redact.py`,
`.github/review-prompts/security-scope.md`, and this workflow). A tightening can
also live outside those paths, so the `security-scope-review` label forces the
lane on. The surface list is a sentinel-delimited array in the same-repo workflow,
and the fork lane reads that one array from the base commit, so the two lanes
scope one surface rather than two that drift. A change that touches nothing on the
surface and carries no label resolves "nothing to scope" and passes.

### Four jobs, split by what each may hold

The job graph is `generate` → `validate` → `adjudicate` → `publish`, and the split
is a trust boundary: the job that holds the Bedrock credential runs no repository
Python, and the job that can write a comment runs only base-committed harness.

| Job | Holds | Runs | Platform |
|---|---|---|---|
| `generate` | the Bedrock credential (`id-token: write`) | Opus 5.5, which proposes `candidates.json` reading with `Read` / `Grep` / `Glob` | ubuntu |
| `validate` | `contents: read` | `scope_candidates.py validate`, which proves the model's file is a corpus the differential can consume | ubuntu |
| `adjudicate` | `contents: read` | `deny_diff.py`, classifying each candidate at the base ref and the head ref | ubuntu, macOS, windows |
| `publish` | `pull-requests: write` | the fold and comment assembly, staged from the base commit | ubuntu |

The model is `us.anthropic.claude-opus-5-5`, with `us.anthropic.claude-sonnet-5-5` as
the overload fallback. `generate` mints the credential but runs no repository
Python, so a prompt injection reaches no product code. `validate` and `adjudicate`
execute the change's own harness — `adjudicate` materializes each ref's own
`kiro_crew.security` into its own directory and classifies against it in a child
process — but hold no credential and no write token, so a judge supplied by the
change under judgement decides nothing worth stealing. `publish` holds the only
write token and reads every program it runs out of a committed base-commit blob,
so the change under review cannot supply the code that folds its own verdict.
`adjudicate`'s legs do not fail-fast: one platform's regression is not evidence
about another's, and the path fence's home-directory ordering and the argv
tokenizer differ per OS.

### The verdict, and why it fails closed

The review emits `[SCOPE-REVIEWED] <sha>` and a `Scope-Verdict: PASS | CONCERNS |
BLOCK` header. The header is the model's opinion and never a gate on its own. The
gate is the differential: a script-confirmed newly-refused operation reds the lane
whatever the model wrote. A model `BLOCK` with no confirmed regression scores
CONCERNS unless it stands on a demonstrated platform gap; a clean fold with a
`PASS` header and a marker for this head passes.

Every outcome that could not settle a verdict — a fold that errored, a confirmed
row that had to be redacted, a platform leg that never reported, or a review that
left no `[SCOPE-REVIEWED]` marker for this head — routes through one constant,
`_UNSETTLED_CONCLUSION` in `scripts/scope_candidates.py`. It is the strict value,
and both lanes map it to a **failing check**. That is the fail-closed contract:
"could not run" and "found nothing" are the same badge to a reader, so they must
not be the same exit code — an unmeasured tightening must not read as "nothing
newly refused". The conclusion table lives in one place,
`scope_candidates.py conclude`, which both lanes call, so a fork can never resolve
more permissively than same-repo.

**That strict value is a ruling, not a default.** Fail-closed was chosen over
resolving neutral, with the cost named: a Bedrock outage or one flaky matrix leg
reds the lane on a PR whose scope may be fine. On a fork PR a re-run clears it: a
run that could not measure marks its own check-run unsettled (a
`[scope-floor:unsettled]` prefix on `output.title`), so the per-head floor does
not stand behind that run and a later clean run publishes clean. On a same-repo
PR the floor's state is the publish job's own check-run conclusion, which the run
cannot mark, so a re-run alone cannot clear a prior flake there — the escape is
the SHA-scoped `/ai-review override scope <sha>`, which bypasses the floor. It is
worth paying on three grounds. It is the failure this lane exists to catch, so the lane
must not commit it about itself. Its blast radius is bounded to the population that
needs the strictness — `generate` resolves `in_scope=false` for a change outside the
security surface, and every step that mints a credential or calls the model is gated
on that answer, so an off-surface PR spends no Bedrock call and completes green
without a model verdict. It is not a workflow-level skip: the cheap deterministic
steps still run, which is deliberate, because a lane reporting `skipped` is read as
"the review has not posted yet" and waited on. What the gate buys is that the two
failure sources this ruling is about — an outage and a flaky matrix leg — cannot red
a PR the lane would not have judged. And
it matches `Opus 5.5 Review` and `GPT 6.1 Review`, both fail-closed in the table
above; a security lane resolving softer than them would be the weakest link in the
same rollup. To reverse the ruling, set `_UNSETTLED_CONCLUSION = "concerns"` — one
constant, no other edit, both lanes already map `concerns` to a non-blocking
neutral. That stays one constant on purpose: `conclude` reports `settled=no` by
comparing against the constant rather than against a token spelling, so the fork
lane keeps marking unsettled runs after a flip instead of silently treating them as
measured. The same-repo floor is indifferent to the value — its state is the job's
own conclusion, and any non-`success` prior floors the head — so `/ai-review
override scope <sha>` remains that lane's escape either way.

### When it goes red

Read the lane's comment. Each row is an operation the classifier confirms `<sha>`
newly refuses, with the tier that refused it and the refusal text. Narrow the rule
so it no longer catches the row. A human who has judged the scope acceptable by
hand records `/ai-review override scope <current-sha>: <reason>` on the same-repo
lane.

**A fork PR's override does not clear this lane yet**, and that is a gap rather than
a rule. The fork lane consumes no override marker today, so a scope judged acceptable
on a fork clears only by re-raising the change from a branch in this repository —
where the same-repo lane does honour the override — or by a maintainer with admin
rights dismissing the required check. It is worth being exact about why, because the
lane used to claim a threat it does not have: the marker is posted by
`ai-review-human-override.yml` as `github-actions[bot]` after that workflow checks the
commenter's write permission, and the same-repo lane authenticates it by that bot
login on this repository's own comment feed, read with this repository's token and
pinned to one head SHA. Nothing in that chain depends on the pull request being
same-repo. Reading it on the fork lane is missing work, tracked in #10109, not a
door held shut. A *transient* failure needs none of this: such a run marks its own
check-run `[scope-floor:unsettled]`, sets no per-head floor, and clears on a re-run.

## `sensitive-change-review.yml`: a reasoned human approval

A PR that touches the sandbox, the command floor, the tool gate, secret
scrubbing or redaction (`SENSITIVE_GLOBS` in
`.github/scripts/sensitive_change_review.py`) stays red until a person with
write access approves the current head and fills the `## Sensitive change
review` template in the approval: what rule changed, before and after, the
worst case, the sandbox evidence checked, no regression (tools still work,
backward compatible, existing tests) and how to undo. Each answer needs at
least three words. Bots, the PR author and approvals of an older commit do not
count, and there is no waiver label. CI never runs the sandbox here; it only
checks the approval and its text. The checker always runs from the default
branch, so a PR cannot weaken it.

A fork PR that touches a sensitive path is refused, whatever its approvals: a
maintainer takes it over on a branch of this repository, credits the author
with `Co-authored-by:` and `Supersedes #<n>`, and drives that PR green. On a
same-repository PR the gate keeps one sticky comment (by `github-actions[bot]`,
marked `<!-- sensitive-change-review -->`) listing the sensitive files and the
template to paste into the approval. That comment is why the job holds
`pull-requests: write`.

**Advisory for now.** `PR Readiness` does not read it yet. Enrolling it waits on
the workflow itself running from default-branch context
([#16870](https://github.com/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/issues/16870)); until then a PR
can edit the workflow file to skip the check.

## `pr-readiness.yml`: the aggregator

It executes no tests. It resolves the PR's current head SHA, **drops stale events**,
reads the head's `pull_request` workflow runs **once** and picks the latest run per
monitored workflow out of that page, and publishes **one `PR Readiness` commit
status plus one `readiness:` label**.

- **Always required:** Fast Gate, CI, Build, Code Review, Issue Gate, and
  Internal Content Scan (the same-repository workflow or the fork check-run). `Fast Gate` is a lane in
  its own right and not merely CI's precondition — a red gate must red the PR, and
  `await-fast-gate` reports `failure` rather than the gate that actually broke, so
  the readable verdict has to come from the gate workflow itself. It carries CI's
  `branches: [main]` filter, so it sits in the same stacked-PR carve-out: on a PR
  whose base is not the default branch it never starts, and a monitored lane that
  reads `(not started)` would freeze the verdict at pending forever.
- **Additionally required on a same-repo PR:** CodeQL, Opus 5.5 Review, GPT 6.1
  Review, Security Scope Review, and completion of Design Review, UX Review and
  First Principles Review.
- **Design Review, UX Review and First Principles Review are completion-required
  AND block on a genuine `BLOCK`:** the aggregator scores each lane's `failure`
  conclusion as a readiness blocker. Each lane's status step fails the check on a
  `BLOCK` verdict and exits 0 on `PASS`, `CONCERNS` or a verdict-less run; the
  same-repo lanes additionally go red when the model step itself errors (no
  `continue-on-error`, so a review that did not run is an honest red that a re-run
  clears, never a verdict), while the fork lanes resolve such a run to `neutral` --
  with one deliberate exception: the fork UX lane completes as `failure` when an
  attachment download failed for a transport reason, because a change the lane could
  not evaluate must not read as advisory.
  So a `failure` means a design judged wrong, an experience judged broken, a surface
  judged unjustified, a change the lane could not evaluate on the evidence supplied,
  or -- same-repo only -- a review that errored before producing a verdict.
  Where this was decided: the aggregator has scored these three lanes' `failure` as a
  readiness blocker since it began reading them (`pr-readiness.yml`, the Design / UX /
  First Principles branch of the check-run reader), which is what turned them from
  advisory into gates; the evidence-gap and product-shape rules in the prompts are
  the verdict-side counterpart of that promotion (issue #10476), so that a lane which
  could not evaluate a change reaches the verdict the aggregator already enforces.
  The rollback for those rules is one revert of that change; the aggregator's scoring
  is unaffected by it.
- **Security Scope Review is required and fails closed:** the aggregator scores
  its `failure` as a plain blocker, because that conclusion covers both a
  script-confirmed newly-refused operation and a run that measured nothing — an
  errored fold, a missing head marker, or a platform leg that never reported.
  It is deliberately not relabelled `(BLOCK)` the way Design Review is, because
  a `failure` here does not always mean a verdict was reached.
- **CodeQL is not a checked-in workflow.** It runs via GitHub default setup. The
  aggregator first resolves the analysis run by
  `path == "dynamic/github-code-scanning/codeql"`, then reads the exact head SHA's
  `CodeQL` check from the `github-advanced-security` app. A successful analysis
  run does not mask a failed security result. An absent, running, or interim
  neutral result remains `checking`; `skipped` still counts as passed for the
  managed workflow.
- **Labels:** `readiness: checking` (pending), `readiness: action required` (a
  blocker), `readiness: passed`. Exactly one is ever present.
- **It also enforces the disposition rule.** Besides scoring lanes, readiness runs
  `pr_status.py --disposition-gate` (checked out from the default branch, never
  from the PR head — this workflow is `pull_request_target` and holds write
  tokens) and folds each violation of the one-lane / one-rationale-per-finding
  rule into its blocking list. That is the only enforcement point that binds a
  writer who never runs the kirocrew-prepare-pr loop, which is what a blanket
  single-rationale record used to escape through (#6658). The rule keeps ONE
  implementation: the readiness step calls the same script the local gate does
  rather than re-reading the marker grammar in shell. A record set it cannot read
  is `pending`, never red — a transient comments-API failure must not fail the
  required status — and a record whose author the collaborators permission API
  does not confirm as a writer is ignored, exactly as `codex-review.yml`'s
  adjudication ledger ignores it, so the gate never blocks on a record that holds
  no downgrade power. One consequence to know: readiness has **no
  `issue_comment` trigger**, so correcting the offending comment fires nothing by
  itself. `pr-readiness-sweep.yml` mode 5 covers that — it treats a disposition
  record whose `updated_at` is newer than the verdict as evidence the verdict is
  stale, and re-fires the recompute within one sweep tick (~5 minutes). Deleting the record with
  no replacement leaves nothing observable and waits for a push or a manual
  dispatch. The comparison is not race-free and is not claimed to be: the gate
  reads the comments early in the readiness job while the status is published at
  the end, so a record created in between is missed by that run and also looks
  older than the verdict to the sweep. What bounds that residual is the harm
  model, not the detection -- a violating record's only power is letting the
  adjudication ledger downgrade a REPEATED finding on a later review round, and a
  later review round takes a push, which recomputes readiness and catches the
  violation.
- **An advisory lane that published no verdict is neither passed nor failed.**
  Design, UX and First Principles decide their conclusion from their own output
  file, so a lane that computed a verdict and then failed to write its PR comment
  still completes `success` — the publish-failure arms of the shared comment
  upsert emit an `::error::` and return 0. Counting that as reviewed is what let
  the required status read green while `pr_status.py` read BLOCKED off the same
  slot. The same `--disposition-gate` call reports which of those lanes owe the
  head a verdict they never published, from `evaluate_reviewer_markers` — so the
  freshness, enrolment and human-override rules have one definition and the two
  gates cannot disagree. The question is asked of a slot that EXISTS and is
  stale, not of the whole lane set: a lane with no slot has two causes that read
  identically from the comments -- it published nothing because it deliberately
  had nothing to say, and its create-path publish was lost -- and only the lane
  itself can tell them apart, by leaving a notice naming the head. Reporting
  absence before the scope-skip arms write one would hold every revision that
  touches no UI surface on a lane a re-run cannot fill, so that half waits on a
  change to those lanes. Two answers still exempt a lane whose slot is there: a
  writer's override record for this head (that path does not re-run the model, so
  no stamp can exist), and a slot holding the lanes' own stampless "skipped"
  notice FOR THIS HEAD (a re-run reproduces it rather than filling it; a notice
  naming an earlier head is not an answer for this one). Readiness lists an owing
  lane as a named **pending** that re-running that lane clears, never a red: a
  `failed` there would publish a BLOCK verdict no reviewer reached (#13363).
- **It also reports a verdict this head's own re-sample replaced.** A review
  lane's marker comment is ONE slot keyed on the lane, never on the head, so a
  second sample at one head overwrites the first and the board keeps only the
  survivor. Every body the slot ever held survives in GraphQL
  `userContentEdits`, so readiness runs `pr_status.py --supersession-gate` and
  folds each lane where a replaced sample BLOCKED this head, while the body now
  presented does not, into its blocking list. A sample blocks in either spelling
  the lanes use: `[BLOCK-MERGE] <head>`, which GPT and Opus write, or a
  `<Lane>-Verdict: BLOCK` line from Design, UX or First Principles, which never
  write that marker at all. The history read is a cheap question first — how
  many bodies has this slot held — and pays for the bodies themselves only when
  that count exceeds one, because a slot holding one body has nothing that could
  have been superseded. An unreadable count is not zero.
- **A sanctioned clear is read where a model cannot write, and only on the one
  lane that has one.** Adjudication and `/ai-review override` clear a GPT block
  by rewriting `[BLOCK-MERGE] <head>` to `[BLOCK-MERGE-DOWNGRADED] <head>`,
  which necessarily leaves a superseded blocking body behind — so that clear
  must be recognised or the gate reds a legitimate one forever. It is NOT
  recognised by grepping the marker: on the non-blocking path the presented body
  embeds the model's own output file verbatim, so review prose over a diff
  containing that string would forge a clearance, the same reason
  `codex-review.yml` refuses to grep its own refusal marker. It is read from the
  workflow-authored `(all downgraded on adjudication)` heading, which is printed
  from the parsed decision ABOVE the first `<details>` while the model's output
  sits inside one, head-scoped to that same region. That shape holds only for
  `codex-review.yml` and `fork-gpt-review.yml`, so the exemption is restricted
  to the GPT lane by name and `test_prepare_pr_supersession.py` asserts from
  source both that no other workflow prints the heading and that only those two
  wrap their prose — a lane gaining the path, or GPT losing its wrapper, reddens
  there instead of quietly widening the exemption.
- **The clearance path differs by lane family, and the gate's failure text says
  which.** On the GPT lane, clear the verdict the sanctioned way and the gate
  reads it as cleared. The whole-design lanes have no downgrade artifact at all,
  so a superseded BLOCK there cannot be stamped away. Their same-head exit, and
  every lane's, is `/ai-review override <lane> <head>`. The same-repo arm
  replaces the slot with an unstamped note, which ends the reading. A Stage-2
  fork lane writes no note, so the gate reads the record itself. A block counts
  as adjudicated when an accepted override for that lane (or `all`) names this
  head EXACTLY, its marker comment was written by a trusted marker author
  (`github-actions[bot]` by default, with the marker as its leading bytes), and
  the record was posted strictly after the block was published. A block
  published in or after the second of the newest record stays named. The record's
  time is when the handler posted it, which can trail the command by the
  handler's queueing time, so a block landing inside that window is a stated
  residual. A marker for another
  head or lane, from an untrusted author, or quoted inside any other comment
  clears nothing. A new head is the other exit, and it discards every other
  lane's verdict for this head. An override posted after the last readiness
  evaluation is read at the next one; to recompute now, run
  `gh workflow run pr-readiness.yml --ref main -f pr=<n> -f sha=<full head sha>`.
  An ordinary same-head
  re-sample that did not drop a block is reported for information and does NOT
  gate. A reading the gate could not establish is `pending`, never red, for the
  same reason the disposition gate's is — an unreadable comment history is not
  "no verdict was superseded" — and the step is skipped for `dependabot[bot]`
  with the same condition the lanes carry, because on such a pull request no
  lane ever publishes and `pending` would strand the status for the life of the
  head with nothing able to clear it. The local `pr_status.py` fails closed on a
  dropped block and on an unreadable reading, because that exit code is what
  arms `gh pr merge --auto`; an empty lane population is a separate cause and
  does not, since the marker evaluation beside it already reports it.
- **Unapproved fork runs remain blocking but are attributed separately.** GitHub
  reports a fork workflow held behind *Approve and run* as `action_required`
  even though it has not executed. Readiness keeps the failure status and
  `readiness: action required` label, but lists those lanes under **Awaiting
  maintainer approval** instead of **Blocking**. It does not call them pending:
  only a maintainer can clear the condition, while pending statuses are eligible
  for automatic self-healing.

Two subtleties:

- **It refreshes when a lane STARTS re-running; a lane's completion reaches it through
  the sweep.** Readiness subscribes to `workflow_run: in_progress` only -- not `completed`,
  not `requested`. A `workflow_run` dispatch is spent the moment GitHub delivers the event,
  before the job runs a step, and every subscribed type fires once per monitored workflow
  per revision plus once per re-run attempt. With `completed` listed that was 24 runs per
  head update by construction and 30 measured, 3006 an hour against ~100 head updates,
  ≥60% of every workflow run this repository created, for a job whose full evaluation
  takes 9-16 seconds. The `pr+sha` concurrency group collapses the burst for execution,
  but a collapsed run has already consumed its dispatch, so the group does not bound that
  cost -- and neither does anything a step does. The only lever on dispatch is which
  events are subscribed.

  So completions are delivered by `pr-readiness-sweep.yml`, every 5 minutes (GitHub's
  shortest schedule). It scans every open pull request over GraphQL -- a separate pool
  from the REST budget the lanes share, a handful of requests for the whole open set --
  and dispatches a recompute for exactly the heads on which a monitored check completed
  after the current verdict was published: 37 heads in a measured 15-minute window,
  against 282 completion events. A pending is examined once it is at least the publish
  lag old (180 s), and a check counts as evidence when it completed after the verdict's
  publication minus that same lag; binding the two to one value is what makes a rescue
  self-terminating on the next tick whatever the cadence (`test_pr_readiness_sweep.py`
  pins the pairing and the reasoning). The cost is latency in the safe direction only: a
  verdict goes green up to one tick plus the lag later than the event made it, never
  earlier.

  `in_progress` stays because it is the one signal completions cannot carry: a monitored
  workflow going BACK to running. A re-run reuses the same run and increments its attempt,
  so `requested` never fires for it and the runs page shows the pre-re-run conclusion
  until the attempt finishes. Without it, a re-run of an already-green lane would leave
  readiness publishing the pre-re-run `success` for the whole re-run -- and since that
  status is the branch-protection handle for the entire fan-out, armed auto-merge could
  merge a revision whose lane is failing at that moment. A sweep cannot close that: its
  evidence is completed checks, and a running lane has none yet. `requested` is the type
  that carries nothing: it fires at run CREATION, when no lane can have a verdict yet and
  readiness has already published `checking` from the `pull_request_target` path.
- **A lane that is itself `workflow_run`-triggered cannot be monitored.** GitHub runs such
  a workflow from the default branch, so the `workflow_run` payload its completion hands
  readiness names the default branch as `head_branch` and the default branch's tip as
  `head_sha` — never the pull request's head. `Resolve current pull request revision` then
  asks which open pull request has `<this repo>:<default branch>` as its head, an answer
  that is empty by construction, and the run exits `SKIP` having published nothing and
  spent one request from the shared hourly REST pool. The seven stage-2 fork reviewers
  (`Fork * Review`, `Fork Internal Content Scan`) all key on Fast Gate this way and were
  listed for years on the stated intent that their completion refreshed a fork verdict; it
  never could. Measured 2026-09-26: 700/700 runs across those seven lanes carried the
  default branch, and because their dispatches all keyed on ONE concurrency group (the
  default branch's tip) rather than per head update, they accumulated across every open
  pull request at once — 158 no-op readiness runs on a single default-branch SHA, 96% of
  readiness's run creation, ~5,100 wasted requests an hour against a 15,000/hour
  installation pool. A fork verdict is refreshed instead the way every verdict is:
  `pr-readiness-sweep.yml` re-fires by PR number when a check on its head completes.
  Two fences hold the rule
  — the trigger allowlist and the job gate's event check — and
  `test_ai_review_workflows.py` pins both.
- **A run triggered by an `in_progress` event holds the verdict and stops.** That event
  MEANS a monitored lane is running, so nothing the status says is known to be true. The
  run makes one read -- of the workflow run the event names, never of the commit status --
  to ask whether that is STILL true, because queue delay can execute a hold long after its
  event. A lane that has since completed gets no hold: its completion is the sweep's
  evidence, and a hold written now would stamp the status newer than that completion and
  push it below the evidence floor with no later event left to lift it. A lane still
  running gets `pending`, written unconditionally, and the run does nothing else -- three
  requests in all, no evaluation. Reading the STATUS first would reopen the stale-success
  window the publish step's POST comment records three guards failing to close; a pending
  over a pending only moves the stamp, and a pending over a failure blocks the merge just
  the same. An unreadable run holds anyway, stamped `[read-failed]`, so the sweep's
  age-based retry recomputes it regardless of evidence. The lane's completion then reaches
  the sweep as evidence newer than the hold, and the recompute it dispatches publishes the
  real verdict with the labels to match. `test_pr_readiness_publish.py` runs the hold step
  against the publish harness and pins all three arms.

  A `success` is re-checked before it is published, on every head: the publish step reads
  the runs page once more and downgrades to `pending` if a monitored lane has started since
  (to `failure` if one has turned red), so a run in an isolated `pull_request_target` or
  `workflow_dispatch` group cannot land a stale success over a re-run -- and this is the
  write a re-run's hold cannot defend against on its own, since the hold lands in seconds
  and the delayed publish lands after it. A fork head's runs list the fork as
  `head_repository`, so the same filter answers for a fork's CI, Fast Gate, Build, Code
  Review and content-scan re-runs. The seven Stage-2 fork review lanes run from the default
  branch and never appear there; on a fork success they are read once more from the head
  SHA's check-runs, bound as the verdict step binds them -- to this pull request AND to Fast
  Gate's newest run + attempt, since a Fast Gate re-run leaves the previous attempt's seven
  green rows on the SHA until the re-run's lanes post theirs -- and a lane with no current
  row or a row still running holds the publish, while a row completed red (each fork lane
  fails its check ONLY on a real BLOCK) publishes red. Both arms collapse a lane's runs the
  way the verdict step does, a cancelled max-id run yielding to a later-started sibling, so
  the re-check never reds a lane the evaluation scored green. CodeQL is read on same-repo heads only -- it
  is a `dynamic` run, invisible to a re-check filtered to `event=pull_request`, and its
  security verdict is a separate exact-SHA check-run a re-scan re-opens; a fork head cannot
  run it.

  The fork re-check is the one read that binds a row by **name** as well as
  `external_id`, so #16238's rename (`Opus 5 Review` -> `Opus 5.5 Review`, `GPT 5.6 Review`
  -> `GPT 6.1 Review`) froze every fork head reviewed before it at "(not started)". The
  job's `LEGACY_LANE_NAMES` table (old name -> current name, renamed lanes only) lets an
  old-name row answer for its lane **only when the head has no bound row under the current
  name**, read exactly like one: red publishes red, running holds, and the `external_id`
  binding still applies. The hold step and `MONITORED_LANES` key on run ids and workflow
  files, so they need no alias. A head stuck before the alias merged has no new check
  evidence for the sweep, so re-dispatch it once:
  `gh workflow run pr-readiness.yml --repo kirodotdev/KiroCrew --ref main -f pr=<PR> -f sha=<full 40-char head sha>`
  (a short sha reads as a stale revision and publishes nothing).
  Remove the table once no open PR has a pre-#16238 head (#16373).

  Each run ends with a `pr-readiness: core rate limit -- N/M remaining` log line
  (`GET /rate_limit` is free) so the pool's draw can be measured rather than estimated.
  Screening events before the evaluation was measured and then withdrawn: settling an
  event skips the publish, and the publish is the only write that corrects an isolated,
  never-cancelled publisher's stale success, so every screened shape moved that write
  earlier and widened the window in which such a success is the last write on the sole
  required status. Commit statuses are last-write-wins with no conditional write, so no
  read closes it. That is why the remaining reduction was taken at DISPATCH -- dropping
  the `completed` subscription -- which carries no such exposure: it moves no write
  earlier, it only delivers the final one a few minutes later.
- **A `pull_request_target` run gets its own isolated concurrency group.** Those are
  the only readiness runs that surface as a CheckRun in the PR's rollup, and GitHub
  marks any superseded run "cancelled" whichever way `cancel-in-progress` is set, so
  sharing a cancelling group would show a spurious cancelled check on the PR even
  though the authoritative commit status is fine. Un-collapsed runs on superseded
  revisions simply no-op green, because the evaluate and publish steps are idempotent
  and stale-SHA guarded. The `workflow_run` and `workflow_dispatch` runs do not appear
  in the rollup, so they keep the cheap per-`(pr, sha)` burst collapse.
- **The pending sentinel is conditional.** A `pull_request_target` open/synchronize
  run is meant to surface a transient "checking" signal, but it can be
  runner-queue-delayed past the `workflow_run` runs that already published the
  terminal verdict for the same SHA. Adding the sentinel unconditionally would then
  clobber a decided verdict back to `checking` with no further event left to
  recompute it on an unchanged commit, freezing the status at pending indefinitely.
  So it is added only when the live evaluation still found something genuinely
  incomplete.
- **It reads each collection once, not once per lane.** All monitored workflow runs
  come from one `actions/runs?event=pull_request&head_sha=` page (19 workflows in this
  repository fire on `pull_request`, one run each per head), selected per lane by
  `.path`; on a fork, all seven check-run lanes come from one paginated read of the
  head's check-runs, bound per lane by `external_id`. Per-lane reads were ~11
  requests per evaluation at ~250 evaluations an hour under load -- the largest
  single draw on the hourly REST pool every workflow here shares through
  `GITHUB_TOKEN` (15,000 requests an hour, the Enterprise Cloud ceiling). That pool
  ran dry on 2026-09-15 and again on 2026-09-23: every AI lane failed closed and this
  job logged `API rate limit exceeded for installation`. The one cost of the
  consolidated read is that a renamed monitored workflow file reads as
  `(not started)` instead of a loud 404; `test_pr_readiness_evaluate.py` pins every
  monitored file to `.github/workflows/`, so the rename fails its own PR instead.
  The PR lookup for a `workflow_run` event is scoped the same way: the event
  carries the head repository and branch, so `pulls?state=open&head=<owner>:<branch>`
  answers in one request; the walk over every open PR (seven pages at 600 open PRs)
  remains only for an event that carries neither field. The default branch comes from
  the event payload, and `pr_status.py --disposition-gate` reads the PR's comment pages
  once for both the disposition records and the reviewer markers (it walked them twice),
  and `pr_findings.py` uses the same shared read.
- **A transport error during evaluation is non-terminal.** Every read-only `gh`
  call goes through a bounded retry helper (3 attempts with backoff, 120s cap per
  attempt); a non-429 HTTP 4xx is treated as permanent misconfiguration and fails
  the job loudly instead of retrying. A secondary rate limit (`HTTP 403 ... secondary
  rate limit`) is retried like a 429; the **primary** limit (`API rate limit exceeded
  for installation`) is not -- it refills at the top of the hour, not within the
  backoff, so a retry only adds to the volume that emptied the shared pool. It takes
  the same non-terminal branch below after a single attempt. If an **evaluation**
  read still fails after the retries, the evaluate step publishes an explicit
  non-terminal "could not be evaluated" verdict (`pending` under
  `readiness: checking`) instead of exiting
  non-zero — so a transient network/TLS blip during evaluation never leaves a red
  check-run or skips the publish step (issue #2753: the same commit evaluated
  green then red 39 seconds apart). Exhausted retries in the other steps (context
  resolution, closed-PR label cleanup, the publish step's own reads) still fail
  the job — only the evaluation loop has the non-terminal branch. This does not
  weaken the gate: `pending` blocks merge exactly like `failure`, and only a
  transport error with no already-observed blocker takes that branch (a genuine
  failure recorded by an earlier lane dominates and the verdict stays the
  terminal red `action required`, with a summary note that the evaluation was
  truncated). Recovery is automatic — the self-heal sweep re-fires stale pending
  statuses, and any later monitored-workflow event recomputes sooner. A truncated
  run defers (publishes nothing) only when the revision already carries a
  **blocking** verdict — the merge is already held and pending would only discard
  the red's diagnostics. Every other prior state publishes pending: an existing
  *success* is re-pended (a rerun means validation state is unknown again, and a
  stale green left mergeable is the unsafe direction — pending can only ever
  block, never allow), and an unreadable verdict state gets the same fail-safe
  treatment. The status
  POST itself is never retried: commit statuses are last-write-wins with no
  conditional write, so any retry races a concurrent run's newer verdict — a
  failed POST fails the step loud and a re-run republishes. The label writes
  keep only the narrow 404/already-exists race tolerance they already have.
- **Nothing keys off `workflow_run.pull_requests`.** That array is empty whenever the
  head repository is a fork, the same GitHub behaviour the `fork-*` workflows already
  work around. The job gate admits every `pull_request` and `dynamic` run and lets the
  head SHA resolve to a PR through `pulls?state=open&head=<owner>:<branch>` matched on
  `head.sha` (not `repos/:repo/commits/:sha/pulls`, which lists only PRs whose head
  commit is reachable in this repository -- empty for every open fork PR), and a
  monitored run is bound back to the PR by `(head_repository.full_name, head_branch)`
  on top of the `head_sha=` query — a pair that is populated on a fork run, and
  unique because only one open PR can exist per source repository + branch. Keying
  either place on the PR number froze a fork PR at pending forever: the gate skipped
  every re-evaluation, so
  the verdict was whatever the `pull_request_target` run saw *before* the monitored
  workflows existed, and the lookup independently reported already-green workflows as
  `(not started)`.

## Fork PRs

A fork PR gets no repository OIDC credentials or secrets, and this repository's
managed CodeQL workflow is not scheduled for fork heads. Two consequences.

**A fork PR can still reach `readiness: passed`.** The `fork-*` pipeline below runs
the AI reviews from the trusted base branch and posts them as check-runs under the
same names the same-repo lanes use, so `pr-readiness.yml` evaluates a fork from
those check-runs and a fully green fork is fully validated. That read is **bound to
the lane's `external_id`**, which carries the PR number plus the triggering run id
and attempt (`<lane>-pr-<PR>-<run>-<attempt>`), not the check-run name alone: two
open PRs can share a head SHA and each posts a check-run under this same name, and a
rerun on an unchanged head leaves the previous attempt's row in place, so a
name-only read could let a sibling PR's clean verdict — or a stale previous-attempt
row — answer for this PR. Readiness derives the expected id from the newest run of
the triggering workflow (`Fast Gate`); when no matching row exists yet the lane
reads as pending, which holds the merge rather than borrowing an answer. A
human-override rerun (`gh api .../runs/<id>/rerun`) re-executes a lane's run
directly without Fast Gate re-running, so the trigger-bound id stays identical
between the stale failed attempt and the fresh rerun -- readiness resolves that by
collapsing every check-run sharing an id to the newest by check-run id (distinct per
POST, monotonically increasing), so the fresh rerun always wins. `pr-readiness.yml`
does NOT see that rerun's own `workflow_run: in_progress` event: a `Fork <lane>` run
is `workflow_run`-triggered, so it is barred from the trigger allowlist and its
payload could not resolve a pull request anyway. The evaluation therefore reads
check-runs at whatever state the triggering lane's event found them in, and a rerun
whose fresh "Open check-run" row lands after that read still shows its OLD completed
verdict until the next event. `pr-readiness-sweep.yml` mode 2 closes that within 15
minutes on the check evidence. The `WR_NAME = "Fork $cname"` branch in the evaluate
step was written for this race and has never been reachable; its comment records that.
CodeQL is
the single ineligible lane, reported as a non-blocking "Not eligible" note rather
than a blocker. Readiness therefore says the same thing on a fork as anywhere else: the
eligible automated validation passed for this revision. Human approval and branch
protection remain separate gates.

**The `fork-*` pipeline gives fork PRs AI review anyway, in two stages.**
`fork-opus-review.yml`, `fork-gpt-review.yml`, `fork-design-review.yml`,
`fork-ux-review.yml`, `fork-first-principles-review.yml` and
`fork-security-scope-review.yml` each trigger on the
**completion of `Fast Gate`** (stage 1) and run privileged from the default branch
(stage 2), gated on
`workflow_run.head_repository.full_name != github.repository`. Each posts a check-run
named exactly like its same-repo twin (`Opus 5.5 Review`, `GPT 6.1 Review`,
`Design Review`, `UX Review`, `First Principles Review`, `Security Scope Review`),
so branch protection is
satisfied on either path, and it opens that check-run as early as possible keyed to
`head_sha` so a job that dies still leaves a fail-closed result.

Stage 1 is `Fast Gate` rather than `CI` because what stage 2 needs from stage 1 is a
TRUSTED workflow's word on the head commit, and `Fast Gate` gives that in about a
minute where `CI` took ~54. That is a latency change, not a trust change: the
security properties below hold whatever stage 1 is, since none of them depend on
`CI` having gone green. `CI`'s verdict was a quality precondition here, never a
security one — and `fork-workflow-guard.yml`, which IS a security lane, still keys on
`CI` and is unaffected.

On a fork PR this lane is the **only** publisher of that name -- the same-repo twin
renames itself (see the reviewer-job security posture above) -- so the protected
status can only be reported by a review that actually ran.

`fork-gpt-review.yml` publishes its GPT verdict by editing one marker comment in
place, so an incomplete run must never bury a posted verdict (the class of bug tracked
as #8292). It goes further than a preserve-and-prepend approach: an incomplete run never
modifies an existing comment at all. Overlapping runs for different SHAs can read the
comment before a newer run publishes its verdict, so an incomplete run that read verdict
V1 first must not PATCH V1 back over a newer run's V2 that landed in between -- and even
a PATCH that only preserved the verdict and prepended a notice would restore that stale
body. So when an existing bot comment is present, an incomplete run leaves it entirely
untouched (a diagnostic log line only), whether or not it carries a `[GPT-REVIEWED]`
verdict. Completed and blocked verdicts still replace the comment as before, and the
fail-closed `Finalize check-run` step is unchanged, so an incomplete run is never
mistaken for an approval and merge safety is unaffected.

Nothing the fork controls can influence these reviews:

- `workflow_run` **always** runs the workflow definition from the **default branch**,
  so a fork editing these files in its PR has no effect on what runs.
- `github.event.workflow_run.head_sha`, `head_repository.full_name`, and
  `head_branch` are set by GitHub and form the authoritative trigger identity. The
  four review resolvers changed in D1 (Design, GPT, Opus, and UX), plus Workflow
  Guard, aggregate every open-PR page, match all three values as jq data, and
  proceed only when exactly one candidate remains; empty or ambiguous identity
  fails closed instead of degrading to a SHA-only first match. First Principles
  and Security Scope remain outside D1's resolver-conversion boundary: they filter
  repository and ref when those fields are present, but retain first-match and
  empty-field compatibility until the dependent D2 change normalizes them.
- Fork-lane concurrency uses the immutable numeric id of the triggering trusted
  workflow run. GitHub retains that id across attempts but assigns distinct runs to
  sibling PR triggers, so reruns collapse while case-only or very long fork refs
  neither collide nor expand the group. The workflow guard prefixes the trusted
  event name, then uses the same run id for `workflow_run` and the immutable
  pull-request id for `pull_request_target`, keeping those numeric ID domains
  separate; its case-sensitive `(repository, ref, SHA)` resolver remains the
  authorization check. Because a run-id group no longer cancels a second trigger
  on the same head (a close/reopen produces a fresh run id), each lane's
  finalize sweep — which completes a check-run row this PR left stranded, matched
  by the `<lane>-pr-<PR>-` prefix — now also compares the row's `external_id`
  run-id dimension and leaves alone any row written by a NEWER run, so an older
  trigger's run can never overwrite a newer one's verdict on the same head.
- The base SHA is re-fetched from the PR via the API and the diff is re-derived from
  GitHub's compare endpoint pinned to `(base_sha...head_sha)`. Stage 1's artifact is
  an untrusted **hint** only, so a fork faking it changes nothing.
- The fork's code is only **read** (the trusted base tree plus the authentic diff as
  a data file), never built, installed or executed.
- `step-security/harden-runner` with `egress-policy: block` and a narrow endpoint
  allowlist, plus short-lived Bedrock-only OIDC credentials, bound the blast radius
  of any prompt injection. That allowlist is coupled to the reviewer's own setup, not
  just to the model call: `allowed_non_write_users` auto-enables the action's
  bubblewrap isolation, which the action bootstraps over apt, so the ubuntu archive
  hosts are load-bearing -- and it then installs the CLI itself over `claude.ai`
  and `downloads.claude.ai`, so those are too. The two phases are sequential, so an
  allowlist carrying only the first still never reaches the model: a green apt phase
  is not evidence the bootstrap resolves. Remove either and the install exits before
  any model call --
  the blocking lane then goes red, and an **advisory** lane publishes `review
  incomplete` as a *neutral* check, which is how three reviewers can stop reviewing
  every fork PR without turning anything red (#12099). The endpoints for both that
  bootstrap and the bun release asset are pinned by tests in
  `test/test_ai_review_workflows.py`, because a `workflow_run` lane always executes
  the default branch's yaml and so cannot exercise its own change pre-merge.

**`fork-workflow-guard.yml`** blocks a fork PR that modifies anything under
`.github/**`, the vector a fork would use to fake basic-CI results (rewrite `ci.yml`
to pass) or tamper with CODEOWNERS. It is deterministic on purpose: "does the diff
touch `.github/**`" is a file-path check, so a grep on the authentic changed-file
list is completely reliable, instant and free, where a model gate would be slower,
cost money and could hallucinate. It runs from the default branch (via `workflow_run`
of CI, plus `pull_request_target` for the override-label re-evaluation), so a fork
cannot disable it, and a fork's own `pull_request` runs have no `checks: write` to
forge its verdict. A maintainer who has reviewed a legitimate workflow change applies
the `allow-fork-workflow-change` label and the guard re-evaluates green; the label is
stripped on a new revision, so the override cannot carry over.

One class of file under `.github/**` is exempt: the ratchet baselines
(`.github/coverage-baselines/*.txt` and `.github/*-baseline.txt`). They are plain
data consumed by gates that run from the trusted base workflow, so a fork editing one
cannot run code or forge a check-run -- the worst it can do is loosen its own ratchet,
which is a visible line in the diff that CODEOWNERS review already covers. A fork PR
that adds a file, or shrinks a baselined one, has to edit these to pass the coverage
and lint gates, so guarding them blocked every such contribution for nothing. The
exemption is an exact-shape allowlist (a `.txt` leaf directly under
`coverage-baselines/`, or a top-level `*-baseline.txt`), not a directory prefix, so
`.github/coverage-baselines/x/evil.yml` or `.github/workflows/foo-baseline.txt` are
still caught.

## `dependency-vulnerability.yml`: the production npm gate

Every publication runs one blocking production-dependency control in
`.github/workflows/dependency-vulnerability.yml`. It deliberately does NOT run per pull request: the
audit reaches the npm registry, whose slow hours made it the one red X on otherwise-green PRs
(re-run by hand until it passed) — and a gate people learn to re-run until green is not a gate. It
runs where a vulnerable dependency would actually ship, so nothing vulnerable is published, and a PR
that adds or bumps a dependency is checked by the release or nightly that would carry it.

The two callers hang it off different layers on purpose:

- **`release.yml`** — the release wheel and desktop builds depend directly on the gate, so all
  publish, sign, and GitHub Release jobs are transitively unreachable when it fails.
- **`nightly.yml`** — every job that ships bytes to a nightly-channel user (`publish-cli`, the six
  `publish-linux-*` callers, `publish-windows-x64`, `publish-docker`, `sign-and-notarize`) depends on
  the gate; no build job does. main has no dependency gate of its own, so without this a
  high/critical production vulnerability landing on main shipped to nightly users unaudited until
  the next tagged release. Gating the builds instead is what once failed the nightly for hours at a
  stretch — hanging it off publication means a slow registry delays publishing an already-built
  nightly, and a re-run publishes the same artifacts once the audit answers.
  `test_dependency_vulnerability_gate.py` pins both halves: every publish job gated, no build job
  gated.

The gate audits all lockfile-backed Node applications independently:

- `website/package-lock.json`
- `website/electron/package-lock.json`
- `site/package-lock.json`

CI pins Node `24.19.0`, then invokes the exact npm package `npm@10.8.2` through `npx` with
`audit --omit=dev --package-lock-only --ignore-scripts --audit-level=high --json`. It neither
installs project packages nor runs project lifecycle scripts. High and critical production
findings block; information, low, moderate, and development-only findings do not.

**Transient-failure contract.** The audit is an idempotent read, so a stall or connection fault is
retried rather than failed on the first try. The pinned npm is resolved once up front
(`npx --yes npm@10.8.2 --version`, verified to print exactly the pinned version) so the download a
cold runner pays is never charged against an audit's own timeout. Each attempt is bounded by
`AUDIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (180s); an attempt that times out, raises a subprocess error, or exits with
a status other than npm's documented audit results 0/1 **and** carries one of npm's connection-level
markers on stderr (`ETIMEDOUT`, `ECONNRESET`, `EAI_AGAIN`, `E503`, ... — `TRANSIENT_STDERR_MARKERS`)
is retried up to `AUDIT_ATTEMPTS` (3) times with a short backoff. Every attempt of every audit in a
run draws on one shared wall-clock budget (`AUDIT_TOTAL_BUDGET_SECONDS`, 720s, under the job's 15-minute ceiling): no attempt gets
more than the time left, and no retry starts unless the budget still holds its backoff plus a full
attempt's ceiling, so retries cannot outgrow the job's own `timeout-minutes`. Exit 0/1 are never treated as transient
whatever stderr says (1 is the audit answering "vulnerable"), and every other failure below is
definitive and never retried. Exhausting the attempts or the budget fails closed, naming the attempt
count so a persistent registry outage reads as one rather than as a flaky gate.

**Fail-closed contract.** A missing `npx`, missing manifest or lockfile, a warm-up that does not
yield the pinned npm, a transient failure that outlives the retries or the budget, a non-transient
subprocess error, an exit status other than npm's documented audit-result statuses 0/1, empty or
malformed JSON, npm
`error` response, unsupported audit report version, inconsistent counts/status, broken advisory
reference, or high/critical record without a stable advisory identity fails the job. Exit 1 is
accepted only with a structurally valid report that contains high/critical findings. String `via`
references are recursively resolved to leaf advisories, cycles and missing references are errors,
and findings are deduplicated by lockfile, affected package, and advisory. npm registry/advisory
availability is consequently an explicit release dependency: an outage blocks rather than skips
the control.

**Exception contract.** `.vulnerability-exceptions.json` is validated before any audit against the
contract represented by `.vulnerability-exceptions.schema.json` and the stricter date checks in
the gate. The root has exactly `version: 1` and `exceptions`; each exception has exactly:

| Field | Contract |
|-------|----------|
| `package` | Exact npm package name; wildcards are forbidden. |
| `advisory` | Exact canonical `GHSA-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx` or fallback `npm:<numeric source>` identity. |
| `paths` | One or more exact audited lockfile paths from the list above; no duplicates. |
| `reason` | Trimmed 20–500 character risk justification and mitigation. |
| `owner` | Accountable GitHub `@user` or `@org/team`. |
| `expires` | Real ISO `YYYY-MM-DD` date, no more than 30 days ahead at validation time. |

An exception matches only the package + advisory + lockfile tuple; it cannot suppress another
package, advisory, or project. Duplicate scopes, unknown fields, unsupported paths, malformed
identifiers, or an expiry more than 30 days ahead invalidate the complete file. An expiry date is
valid through that UTC date; beginning the next UTC day, the stale entry fails the entire gate even
if its advisory is no longer reported. Renewal requires a reviewed edit that moves the date back
within the 30-day window and confirms the owner, reason, and mitigation remain current. Remove an
entry as soon as the dependency is fixed; Git history is the approval record.

Run the same control from the repository root with:

```bash
python scripts/check_npm_audit.py
```

The command contacts npm's registry/advisory service. Unit tests mock the subprocess boundary and
cover malformed output, operational failures, report resolution, schema constraints, expiry, and
exact-match exception behavior without network access.

## AI-review human overrides: the authorization rules

The command grammar and the marker contract are in [Human override](#human-override); this section states the authorization and freshness rules the handler enforces.

Human judgment is the final authority over the Opus 5.5 and GPT 6.1
AI-review results. A repository member with `write`, `maintain`, or `admin`
permission can record a false-positive, not-applicable, or accepted-risk
decision with the command below. A writer's agent may post it on that writer's
behalf only under the [Human override](#human-override) rule: never for a
security, data-loss, corruption, crash or removed-guard finding, always with an
`agent:` reason, and the writer whose account posted it stays accountable.

```text
/ai-review override <fable|gpt|design|ux|first-principles|scope|all> <current-sha>: <reason>
```

The decision is intentionally explicit and commit-scoped. The handler resolves
the current PR head and accepts a 7–40-character SHA prefix only when it matches
that head; the trusted record stores the full SHA. Any subsequent push therefore
invalidates the decision and causes normal AI review on the new commit.

**Trust boundary** — `.github/workflows/ai-review-human-override.yml` runs on
`issue_comment`, so GitHub loads it from the default branch. It never checks out
or executes PR-controlled code. Before changing a result it requires:

1. The exact command shape above and a non-empty, at-most-500-character reason.
2. A current-head SHA match.
3. The commenter to have `write`, `maintain`, or `admin` collaborator
   permission. PR authors receive no exemption.

After validation it posts a `github-actions[bot]` comment whose hidden marker
binds `{target, full head SHA, actor, source comment id}`. Reviewer workflows
trust only this bot-authored marker; a raw author or third-party comment cannot
turn a gate green. The handler has only review-control permissions
(`actions:write`, `checks:write`, `pull-requests:write`, and
`contents:read`), and receives no `id-token` or `contents:write`.
`pull-requests:write` is required for the handler to create the trusted record
on a pull request; `issues:write` alone does not make that write reliable for a
GitHub Actions installation token.

For Opus 5.5 and GPT 6.1, the handler re-runs the existing PR workflow. The
re-run resolves the trusted marker before acquiring AWS credentials, skips the
model invocation, updates the existing summary with a human-override banner,
and exits its original gate successfully. Either event ordering — an override
recorded before a reviewer starts, or one arriving during model execution —
leaves the SHA-scoped human decision authoritative.

The marker-keyed comments expose the override command to repository
writers. GPT 6.1 also normalizes each current-commit result into a
top verdict plus one sentence: `✅ no blocking findings`,
`🔴 changes requested (blocking)`, an incomplete state, or a human-override
state, so a green verdict from the previous commit is never left looking
current.

When no current-SHA override is active, GPT 6.1 injects a bounded
ADJUDICATION LEDGER into the review prompt: the bot-authored override
records, plus the marker and finding-title lines of review-disposition
comments whose authors' current collaborator permission is `write`,
`maintain`, or `admin` (verified per login against the collaborators
permission API — the same check the override handler applies to its actor).
Prior review bodies are never injected. The ledger is nonce-delimited,
capped at 6,000 bytes, and explicitly untrusted data: it can downgrade the
repetition of an adjudicated finding class to advisory, and it can never
waive a new defect or authorize a green verdict.

GPT makes exactly two GPT calls. Pass 1 discovers candidates across the
full diff; pass 2 attempts to falsify each candidate and emits the only GPT
verdict exposed to the comment and gate. Blocking candidates may then receive a
separate, conditional Opus 5.5 adjudication. Pass 2 also drops or downgrades a
candidate whose proposed fix violates the FIX BAR, a BLOCKING candidate that
cannot be anchored to an AUTOSDE rule or residual defect class, and a
relocated variant of a ledger-adjudicated class; an adjudication goes stale
for lines the current head materially changed. A prior disposition never
hides a currently provable new defect. Any failed call makes the review
incomplete and leaves no current-SHA reviewed marker, so the gate fails
closed.

## Readiness: what the aggregate does and does not mask

The job's inputs and outputs are in [`pr-readiness.yml`: the aggregator](#pr-readinessyml-the-aggregator); this section states the masking guarantees.

`.github/workflows/pr-readiness.yml` publishes one current-revision answer for
the repository's fan-out of CI and AI reviews. The commit status context is
`PR Readiness`; the PR carries exactly one matching managed label:
`readiness: checking`, `readiness: action required`, or `readiness: passed`.
The workflow creates missing labels idempotently, replaces the prior readiness
label, and removes readiness labels when the PR closes. A passed label means
the automated lanes passed for that SHA; it does not represent human approval.
Making `PR Readiness` a required status remains an explicit branch-protection
or ruleset setting outside the workflow.

The aggregate covers the latest PR result for Fast Gate, CI, Build, Code Review,
Issue Gate, Internal Content Scan, Opus 5.5 Review, GPT 6.1 Review (two GPT passes plus
conditional Opus adjudication), Security Scope Review, Design Review, UX Review,
and First Principles Review. For managed CodeQL it requires
both the dynamic analysis workflow and the exact-head `CodeQL` security result
published by the
`github-advanced-security` app. This preserves failures from an Analyze job and
also prevents a successful analysis workflow from masking alert-driven failure.
Default setup can publish a neutral interim result before every configured
language reports; that state remains `checking` and the existing stale-pending
sweep requests another evaluation if no workflow event follows the final result.
Fork PRs cannot receive repository secrets or
OIDC credentials, and this repository's managed default-setup CodeQL workflow
is not scheduled for fork heads. The secret-backed AI reviews therefore run for
forks from the trusted base branch via the `fork-*` pipeline and are graded from
the head SHA's check-runs, leaving CodeQL as the only lane explicitly ineligible
for a fork. Missing or running eligible lanes
produce `checking`; blocking workflow/check failures produce
`action required`; drafts remain `checking`.
Design Review, UX Review, and First Principles Review must complete. `PASS` and
`CONCERNS` remain advisory, while a genuine `BLOCK` fails the lane and blocks
readiness; same-repository model execution failures also remain blocking until a
successful re-run or authorized override. Mergeability, behind-base state,
and human review decisions are not part of this event-driven aggregate because
they can change without an aggregate refresh event; branch protection and the
live `kirocrew-prepare-pr` status check own them.

Every event resolves the PR's current head through the GitHub API. An event
carrying an older expected SHA is ignored, so a late
run cannot relabel the new revision. A code-free `pull_request_target` handler
updates same-repository and fork PRs from the trusted base workflow. Actions
that start or restart validation for the same SHA, including a PR description
edit that re-runs Code Review, force the aggregate to `checking` before run
lookup so an older successful same-SHA run cannot keep readiness green. Trusted
base-repository `workflow_run` events refresh it as eligible lanes finish,
including the `fork-*` reviewer completions that carry a fork's verdicts.
Readiness-label events cannot recursively rerun or cancel a review: ignored label
events use a per-run concurrency key, so they cannot cancel an
active review or replace a pending authoritative reviewer event.

The bundled `kirocrew-prepare-pr` skill owns the local pre-push procedure. It resolves
read-only reviewers and gates from the base-ref profile, extracts each reviewer's
own CI contract, and binds publication to the verifier-cleared SHA. AI-comment
repair delegation follows [Agent repair routing](#agent-repair-routing), not a
replacement of that profile. Dispositions retain the prior judged SHA, finding
identity and evidence; they never carry a human override onto a new head.

`kirocrew-prepare-pr/scripts/pr_status.py` folds the aggregate status in as one signal,
never an override of the rows: its FAILURE blocks and its PENDING waits, but its
green does not clear an observed failing or pending duplicate check in GitHub's
rollup, because the aggregate's `context` is a forgeable display string a status
publisher on the pull request can set. Older PRs without the aggregate retain the
fail-closed legacy rollup behavior. Only the commit-status `context` named
`PR Readiness` is read as the aggregate; a same-named CheckRun cannot mask
another failure. Unresolved review threads are reported for visibility but are
advisory rather than an automatic readiness failure.

## Over-engineering resistance

AI-native coding skews toward over-engineering, and a naive AI reviewer compounds it
by demanding still more mechanisms, which produces unending review loops. Every layer
resists this:

- **Both line reviewers share an identical FIX BAR:** every finding must carry a fix
  expressible as an edit to lines **this PR changed**. If the fix would need a new
  function, module, abstraction, config knob, dependency, or an edit to untouched
  code, it is out of scope for the bot. GPT 6.1 drops such a finding; Opus 5.5
  **demotes it to advisory instead of dropping it** -- the author cannot land the
  remedy in this PR, so it must not gate the merge, but the signal is real and a
  human decides. A regression the diff itself introduces still blocks either way,
  since reverting the hunk is an in-diff fix. **The absence of a
  mechanism is never a finding.** This makes "add mechanism X" structurally
  un-reportable: the demand fails the bar before it can become a finding. A scope cap
  complements it: Opus 5.5 stays within the evident scope of the diff (it is code-only),
  and GPT 6.1 stays within the PR's stated purpose, flagging a
  description-versus-diff mismatch as an **advisory** finding rather than a block.
- **The WHAT BLOCKS list is closed:** exhaustive, never extended, never reasoned about
  by analogy, with no "and other serious issues" clause. A finding blocks only if it
  is a `blocking: true` AUTOSDE-rule violation on a changed file (or this PR
  weakening such a rule), or a **reachable and concrete** residual-class defect: a
  security hole with a named trigger, a crash or data loss or corruption on a path
  this diff changes, or a removed guard with no compensating replacement. Style,
  naming, speculative performance and hypotheticals never block.
- **Design and UX suggestions must be proportionate,** and Design carries the
  simpler-alternative ethos: actively flag when a materially simpler solution exists,
  but always advisory.
- **`kirocrew-prepare-pr`'s severity gate closes the loop:** validate each finding's
  legitimacy first, fix the true Critical and High ones, **rebut a false positive with
  evidence rather than appeasing it by changing correct code**, and defer the low ones.
  Combined with the single-commit rule and description reconciliation, that keeps a PR
  converging on its stated purpose instead of accreting scope round over round.

The net effect: expensive or irreversible risk blocks, and everything else is advice a
human can take or defer. "More mechanism" is deliberately not a demand that can block.
