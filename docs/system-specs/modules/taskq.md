# Task Queue (`kiro_crew/taskq/`)

## Overview

`taskq` is the durable store and state machine under persistent, row-backed
work the gateway accepts and owes an outcome for. A persistent subagent spawn is
written to `$KIROCREW_HOME/tasks/tasks.db` **before** its id is returned; a
gateway that crashes finds the row on restart, settles what the previous
incarnation left active, and dispatches what never started. Memory pressure
defers a row instead of refusing it. Incognito and Temporary work, and an
operator-selected `agent.task_queue_enabled=false`, use the in-memory admission
path and create no task row. The in-memory spawn queue is a bounded window over
the store's rows, so 2000 accepted persistent tasks are 2000 rows and at most
`agent.task_dispatch_window` Python objects.

The package is the single scheduling source of truth. TaskRunner's
`runs.json`, the workflow `RunRegistry`, and the subagent run folders
(`state.json`, `tombstone.json`, `result.txt`) remain **artifact and evidence
stores**, referenced from a row's `result_ref`; none of them is read to decide
what to dispatch. Design record:

Files:

| Module | Owns |
|---|---|
| `model.py` | `TaskRecord`, the state vocabulary (`STATES`), the one validated `TRANSITIONS` table, `check_transition`, side-effect classes, lease/backoff constants. |
| `store.py` | `TaskStore`: open/journal selection, write-before-ack `accept`, atomic `claim`, generation-fenced writes, `cancel` (from anywhere non-terminal, or conditional on `only_from` / `generation`), `defer` and `deferred_longer_than`, the owed-report reads (`finish(report_owed=)`, `mark_reported`, `owed_reports`), `task_events`, the window reads. `TaskStoreUnavailable`. Network-filesystem detection. |
| `migrate.py` | Schema versioning (`SCHEMA_VERSION`, `apply_schema`) and the idempotent legacy import. |
| `reconcile.py` | `reconcile_on_boot`: settle every row a dead incarnation still owned. |
| `__init__.py` | `open_default_store(home)`: open, import, reconcile, in that order. |

Adapters (who writes rows today): the subagent manager through the `taskq_*`
glue in `subagent_manager/admission/taskq_bridge.py`, plus one shared
`RunnerAdmission` for TaskRunner steps and workflow agent calls — see
[subagent.md](subagent.md) § Durable task queue and § Runner adapters below.
After a restart, the generic reconciler marks interrupted runner rows
`awaiting_adapter` until the owning TaskRunner or workflow adoption sweep settles
or resumes them; that marker is recovery hand-off, not their normal dispatch path.

## Schema (v1, the only shape any build has written)

```sql
CREATE TABLE tasks (
  id TEXT PRIMARY KEY,            -- stable; the subagent id / run id
  parent_id TEXT, root_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  session_key TEXT NOT NULL,      -- owning session; "" for cron/hook roots
  kind TEXT NOT NULL,             -- subagent | workflow_agent | taskrunner_step | chat_turn | cron | hook
  harness TEXT NOT NULL,          -- acp backend id, never a model id
  provider TEXT,                  -- provider lane (the model override for a subagent)
  params_json TEXT NOT NULL,      -- full spawn kwargs: enough to re-dispatch from the row alone
  workspace TEXT,
  scope_ref TEXT NOT NULL,        -- {memory_store, allowed_tools, approval_mode, app}: references, not grants
  state TEXT NOT NULL,
  attempts INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,   -- dispatches so far (bumped by claim)
  next_run_at REAL,               -- NULL = eligible now
  lease_owner TEXT, lease_expires_at REAL,
  generation INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0, -- bumped by every claim and every cancel
  progress_json TEXT, result_ref TEXT, deadline_at REAL,
  idempotency_key TEXT,           -- UNIQUE when present (NULLs never collide)
  side_effect_class TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT 'unknown',
  created_at REAL NOT NULL, updated_at REAL NOT NULL,
  wait_json TEXT,                 -- the WaitRecord while the row is in a WAITING state
  lane TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT ''   -- fairness lane (root session key or 'system'); nested rows inherit the root's
);
CREATE INDEX tasks_parent ON tasks(parent_id, state);  -- wake-by-child lookup
CREATE INDEX tasks_lane ON tasks(lane, state, next_run_at, created_at);  -- per-lane dispatch heads
CREATE TABLE task_events (task_id, seq, ts, kind, data_json, PRIMARY KEY(task_id, seq));
CREATE TABLE meta (key PRIMARY KEY, value);   -- schema_version, incarnation
```

`task_events` is append-only. Core store kinds include `accepted`, `claimed`,
`transition`, `deferred`, `stale_result`, `rejected_transition`, `deliver`,
`imported`, `awaiting_adapter`, `wake`, `wait_updated`, and `child_settled`;
wait, dependency, input-answer, and stop-recovery adapters append the additional
named event kinds described in their sections below. `apply_schema`
runs the one `CREATE ... IF NOT EXISTS` set above on every open (idempotent; a
missing index is regained) and stamps `meta.schema_version = SCHEMA_VERSION`
(`1`); there is no older shape to upgrade from, so the first `if current < N`
step lands only when the shape changes. It refuses a NEWER version.
`meta.incarnation` is the id of the process that last
opened the store; `TaskStore.previous_incarnation` exposes the one before it.

The store file and its directory are owner-only (`platform_compat`).
`params_json` carries the unredacted task text, exactly as the in-memory queue
entry did; it is written nowhere else.

**A GRANT is never a property of the row.** `params_json` is "enough to re-dispatch
from the row alone", and the pump respawns a recovered row by forwarding those
params verbatim — so anything in there is replayed after a restart, on nobody's
renewed say-so. Two keys are therefore process-local and dropped at build time
(`taskq_bridge.taskq_build_record`): `_agent_prevalidated`, an off-loop agent check
whose app could be disabled by the time the row starts, and `approval_mode`, whose
`"auto"` skips the spawn gate AND pre-approves the run's tools. A recovered row
faces the gate its caller faced. `scope_ref` still RECORDS both, which is why the
schema calls that column references rather than grants: no start path reads it.
The one in-process exception is the accepting process's own `approval_mode` for a
row still waiting, restored on its window refill (subagent.md,
`_held_approval_modes`); a restart never sees it.
Pinned by
`test_taskq_admission_integration.py::test_an_ad_hoc_auto_approval_is_never_persisted_on_the_row`,
and the legacy importer drops a persisted `auto_approve` for the same reason
(`migrate.import_legacy`).

## State machine

Fifteen states, one table (`model.TRANSITIONS`), consulted by every write.
`succeeded` in the owner's vocabulary is `done` here (`model.SUCCEEDED`).

```text
queued ──claim──▶ admitted ──▶ starting ──▶ running ──▶ done
  ▲                 │            │            ├─▶ waiting_children ──┐ (WAITING: wake ▶ running,

  └── retry_wait ◀── waiting_infra ◀───────────────┘
 terminal: done | failed | cancelled | unknown_side_effect
```

| Set | States | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `CLAIMABLE` | `queued`, `retry_wait`, `recovering` | a claim may take the row (subject to `next_run_at` and an absent or expired lease) |
| `WAITING` | `waiting_children`, `waiting_permission`, `waiting_dependency`, `waiting_input` | a LIVE run yielded its lane slot; the runtime stays resident; a `WaitRecord` says why (see Waits) |
| `ACTIVE` | `admitted`, `starting`, `running`, `recovering` + `WAITING` | some incarnation owns the row (slot, runtime, or pending rebuild) |
| `EXECUTING` | `starting`, `running` | a runtime is executing under the row; only its owning run can stop the work |
| `PARKED` | `STATES - TERMINAL - EXECUTING` | non-terminal with nothing executing: queued, deferred, in a recovery backoff, or parked on a wake a caller delivers |
| `TERMINAL` | `done`, `failed`, `cancelled`, `unknown_side_effect` | never regress |

`EXECUTING` and `PARKED` partition the non-terminal states, and the partition is
what a wait-level cancel is allowed to act on: `PARKED` is the `only_from` the
store fences `cancel_wait` with, and `EXECUTING` is what `/api/tasks/{id}` and
`/cancel` route to the owning run instead. `admitted` is PARKED, not EXECUTING —
it is claimed and never started, the statement the boot reconciler spends
(§ The claim/start boundary). Pinned as a partition over `STATES` by
`test_overload_integration_glue.py::test_every_state_gets_the_route_verdict_its_own_set_names`,
so a state added to the table without a set fails there instead of silently
losing an operator's cancel.

`recovering` is in both `CLAIMABLE` and `ACTIVE`: a live owner holds its lease
while rebuilding the runtime; a dead owner's lease lapses and the dispatcher
re-claims it. Rules folded into the table:

- `cancelled` is reachable from every non-terminal state and beats everything.
  A CALLER may narrow that to the states it is willing to end
  (`cancel(only_from=…)`); the table does not.
- `failed` is reachable from every non-terminal state (auth re-validation, an
  agent name that stops resolving, a runtime that cannot be built).
- `done` and `unknown_side_effect` are reachable from every `ACTIVE` state,
  the `WAITING` states included: a run can finish before its `running` or
  wake write landed, and reconcile settles what the artifacts prove from
  wherever the crash left the row. `waiting_infra` and `retry_wait` hold no
  runtime and cannot have finished.
- A `WAITING` state leaves only to `running` (wake), `recovering`,
  `retry_wait` (park: the runtime was reclaimed) or a terminal; never straight
  to another wait -- one reason per record. `running → retry_wait` is the
  transient in-run failure.
- `unknown_side_effect` is terminal-pending: only a reconciling adapter that
  can query the external system moves it, and only to `done` or `failed`.
- `admitted → queued` is the expired admit wait (`agent.admit_wait_secs`) and
  the reconcile verdict for a claimed-but-never-started row.

A forbidden edge is never raised at the store boundary: `transition()` returns
`False` and appends `rejected_transition`, because a late writer trying to
regress a terminal row is an expected event, not a bug in the caller. An
unknown state NAME raises `InvalidTransition` — that is a typo.

**A `False` return is a REFUSAL, and a caller that ignores one publishes a state
the row does not have.** The state a caller believes follows the write's result,
never the caller's intent (`Admitted._write` is the shape). Where the belief
gates execution, the write is the fence — see the claim/start boundary below.
`model.steps_to(old, new)` is the one concession, for a POSTED write whose
refusal reaches nobody: it answers with the table's own path (`(new,)`, or
`(starting, new)` when the skipped `starting` step reaches it — `admitted →
starting → running`), never an edge `check_transition` would reject, never an
identity, and never through a terminal. It exists so a mark whose predecessor was
lost is replayed rather than refused for good.

**`starting` is the ONLY intermediate it will insert, and that is the safety
property, not an implementation limit.** A rule of "at most two legal edges"
also blesses `running → retry_wait → queued` and `running → recovering →
admitted`: two legal steps that walk a LIVE row backwards into a state a
dispatcher takes — the re-dispatch-after-work class this helper's callers exist
to close. Direction is therefore enforced IN the helper, never asked of callers
in prose. The restriction cannot be spelled "refuse a CLAIMABLE target from a
non-CLAIMABLE `old`" either: `recovering` is claimable and `admitted` is not, so
that would refuse `taskq_mark(info, "recovering")` — which fires on a
`session/new` timeout, before the first stream event, exactly when the row may
still be `admitted`. The surviving two-step set is `admitted → starting →
{running, recovering, retry_wait}`, pinned exhaustively in
`test_taskq_state_machine.py`.

`TaskStore.advance(task_id, state, generation=)` is the ONE store entry point
that walks that path, so no caller can hold the guarantee while another does not
(§ The claim/start boundary).

### Side-effect classes

`side_effect_class ∈ {none, idempotent_key, unknown}` (default `unknown`).
`none` and `idempotent_key` rows whose owner died are re-dispatched
(`recovering` with backoff -- `model.recovery_backoff_secs` is the shared
recovery ladder's DEFAULT schedule from `recovery/policy.py`, bound at import:
deterministic because `next_run_at` orders rows (the dispatcher jitters on
wake), and pure, so it is the one wait that does NOT follow the
`agent.recovery_backoff_*` snapshot the process ladder takes at boot
([session.md](session.md) § Recovery ladder)); `unknown`
rows go to `unknown_side_effect`. Every terminal `transition()` and every
`cancel()` emits `kirocrew.taskq.completions{outcome=<state>}`. A
subagent run is `unknown` unless its caller says otherwise: its task is
arbitrary and may have pushed a PR. No blind replay of send/pay/submit.

## Write-before-ack

`TaskStore.accept(records)` commits every record in one transaction and
returns the ids only after `COMMIT`. Any failure — a locked database past
`BUSY_TIMEOUT_SECS` (2s), disk full, a duplicate id or idempotency key, a
schema this build cannot write — rolls the whole batch back and raises
`TaskStoreUnavailable`. A caller holding that exception has accepted nothing.
The subagent adapter turns it into a rejection with
`error_code="task_store_unavailable"`, which `POST /api/spawn` forwards as
`code`, and `spawn_run` reports as a task that failed to start. Items are
stored one row each; nothing is batched into a summary row.

Policy refusals — empty task, memory identity, cwd, governance — run BEFORE
accept and leave no row. From accept on, every exit either starts the row,
defers it, or marks it failed.

**`TaskStoreUnavailable` is the ONE type a database failure reaches a caller as,
reads included.** Every public read is wrapped at the store boundary
(`store._typed_read`), not at its call sites. A read is exactly as failure-prone
as a transaction under `journal_mode=delete` — what a data home on a network
filesystem auto-detects into and what `agent.task_store_journal_mode=delete`
selects — because DELETE mode blocks readers behind a competing writer, where WAL
does not. Leaving reads raising `sqlite3.OperationalError` was an omission and not
a design: `except TaskStoreUnavailable` already guarded `state_of` / `get` /
`events` / `count_pending` / `list_rows` / `active_rows` reads across the runner
adapter, the dependency coordinator and every module of the admission package —
the bridge, its wait ledger, the pump and the fairness window — arms that could
not fire. The escape that mattered ran through `TaskStore.advance`,
which reads the row's state before it writes: raw, it left `taskq_mark`'s
best-effort hand-off (`_post_store_write`, which catches the typed error only) and
reached the spawn gate and the run loop, where the pre-queue `store.transition`
had swallowed the identical condition. Pinned in
`test_subagent_dependency_mark.py` and `test_taskq_runner_adapter.py`
(`_requeue_unstarted`'s read-back).

**Off the event loop.** `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` waits up to the busy timeout for
another connection's writer lock, so no store call may run ON the gateway's
loop thread from an async caller. The cost is worse than that timeout alone:
`TaskStore._lock` is ONE `RLock` held across the whole transaction including
the busy wait, and the writer thread is a second contender on it, so a
loop-thread call can queue behind the writer's entire transaction. Past
`dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs` (25 s on the desktop) the watchdog dumps
stacks and kills the gateway.

`TaskStore.run(fn, *args)` executes a store method on the store's ONE dedicated
writer thread (`taskq-writer`) and awaits it. **`run` itself never touches
`_lock`**: it reaches its executor through a separate `_executor_lock` that
guards the executor SLOT and nothing else. Taking `_lock` there would hand the
loop the very busy wait `run` exists to move off it — the writer thread holds
`_lock` across `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` — and would do it invisibly, because that take
is not a connection accessor and `loop_thread_calls` counts nothing.
`test_overload_integration_glue.py::TestStoreOffLoop::test_run_does_not_take_the_connection_lock_on_the_loop`
pins it by WHO releases a held lock: a coroutine scheduled before the `run`, so
a frozen loop leaves it to time out instead. The discipline is diagnosed at
the connection accessor by a module-level `on_loop_db.OnLoopDBGuard` (label
`task store`), which is where a check has to live to catch the interprocedural
case `scripts/check_sync_io_in_async.py` cannot see -- an `async def` that calls
a plain helper that runs the query. Its switch is this surface's own
`taskq.store.STRICT_ON_LOOP_ENV` (`KIROCREW_STRICT_ON_LOOP_TASK_STORE`), NOT
`on_loop_db.STORE_STRICT_ENV`, so arming a task-queue test does not also arm the
knowledge store's tracked backlog; `dev_mode_arms_strict=False` for the reason
`knowledge/store.py` gives. Unarmed it is one throttled WARNING with a stack and
the call proceeds; armed it raises `OnLoopStoreError`. `guard.allow_on_loop()`
is the vetted per-block opt-out. `TaskStore.loop_thread_calls` counts on-loop
takes beside it, because a test asserting "this path took NO on-loop call"
needs a number rather than the absence of a log line.

`POST /api/spawn` therefore goes through
`SubagentManager.spawn_async`: `prepare_spawn` runs every policy gate and
returns a `PreparedSpawn` (id, params, the `TaskRecord`), the record is written
through `store.run(admission.taskq_accept_record, record)`, and only then does
the sync `spawn(**params, _preassigned_id=id, _store_accepted=True)` start the
run -- write-before-ack, with the write off-loop. The same shape serves every
other accept path: `continue_conversation_async` (the follow-up watcher
and `POST /api/spawn/{id}/continue`; the sync `continue_conversation` shares its
prelude, `_continue_prelude`), the app `SpawnSDK` (`apps/spawn_sdk.py`,
which awaits `spawn_async` when the manager has it), and the CHANNEL keyword
spawn door -- `spawn <task>` / `bg <task>` from Slack and `/spawn <task>` from
Telegram, which reach `messaging.commands.spawn_task_reply`. That helper and
`spawn_command_reply` are `async` for exactly this reason, and
`commands._spawn_off_loop` is the same `spawn_async`-when-present shape the
dashboard and the SDK use, so a channel handler on the gateway loop never takes
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` itself. The `/api/tasks` reads run in `asyncio.to_thread`.

That split is a requirement on the CALLER, not a preference. `_continue_prelude`
takes no store call at all, but the sync `spawn` it hands off to takes TWO
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE` transactions on the calling thread — `taskq_accept`'s row write
and `taskq_claim` — so a coroutine that reaches the sync entry pays both on the
loop. The wait is not bounded by `BUSY_TIMEOUT_SECS` (2.0 s, the
cross-connection half): each transaction first takes `TaskStore._lock`, which the
store's own writer thread holds for the whole of whatever store call it is
running, and that wait has no timeout. Measured against a 1 s writer-thread hold,
a coroutine caller's loop serves 0 of the ~95 due 10 ms heartbeat ticks through
the sync entry and 91 through `continue_conversation_async`. Neither write can be
posted instead (`_post_store_write`): the accept's error is what REFUSES the
spawn, so its value has to be awaited, which is what `spawn_async` does. Pinned
by
`test_subagent_continuable.py::test_the_continuation_path_takes_no_store_call_on_the_loop`
(dispatch, the run's mode publication and the terminal settle, under
`loop_thread_calls` with the guard armed) and, for the manager's own continuation
caller, by `::test_the_followup_watcher_dispatches_no_store_call_on_the_loop`.

Reads are held to the same rule, because a queue-depth answer that counts rows
outside the window is a `count_pending` on the same connection.
`SubagentManager.queued_count_for_async` / `has_pending_work_for_async` (over
`admission.taskq_overflow_async`) serve the cron reset-deferral guards and the
chat slot-mode gate; `admission.taskq_pending_ids_for_async` serves
`cancel_for_parent`. Each snapshots the in-memory exclusion set on the loop and
runs only the `count_pending` / `list_pending` half on the writer thread, and the
sync entries stay for the sync callers. `cancel_for_parent` drains the in-memory
queue BEFORE that await, so its "queue entries are removed before the first
suspending await" guarantee still holds.

The dashboard's attached-children guard is on that list too, and it is the one
with the widest set of callers: `chat_utils.subagents_attached_async` is what a
session teardown consume, every 409 route that shares
`_subagents_attached_response`, the RSS-recycle probe and the `chat_done` frame
take, because the guard's queued half is a `_queued_depth` — a `count_pending`
for rows this incarnation never accepted, which is exactly what makes a reset
after a restart see children the in-memory registry cannot. The synchronous
`subagents_attached` stays for callers with no loop under them, and
`test_overload_integration_glue.py::TestStoreOffLoop::test_no_coroutine_calls_the_synchronous_attached_children_guard`
is a whole-package ratchet rather than a list of the converted sites: ONE
coroutine left on the sync entry puts the busy wait back on the loop. Because
that guard wraps its probe in `except Exception` (an unreadable queue is unknown
children, not zero), the strict guard's raise comes back as a fail-closed
ANSWER, so its pin counts `loop_thread_calls` and never expects an exception.
The `SessionManager` sub-agent probe therefore accepts a coroutine predicate and
the cleanup boundary awaits an awaitable answer; `_has_attached_subagents` hands
the answer back UNCOERCED, since `bool()` of a coroutine is True for every
session while never running the probe.

The three channel/dashboard sites reach those entries through a local probe
(`slack.gateway._subagent_work_pending` / `_subagent_queued_count` /
`_subagent_batch_pending`, `dashboard.chat_folders._subagent_work_pending`)
rather than calling them
directly, for the same reason `spawn_sdk` and `handlers.messaging._spawn_on_loop`
probe for `spawn_async`: the manager is duck-typed at those sites, and a double
without the async sibling must answer synchronously instead of having an
`await` land on a non-awaitable.

The same rule reaches the whole-wave reads. `admission.taskq_batch_pending_async`
(a `fetch_pending_by_batch` on the writer thread) is what
`SubagentManager.batch_members_pending_async` and the reaper's
`_sweep_stuck_waves_async` / `_sweep_digest_holds_async` take, and
`admission.lane_snapshot_async` serves `GET /api/spawn/lanes`: it reads the rows
per lane AND resolves a session key whose parent is no longer live
(`lane_for_session`'s `store.get`) in one `store.run`, then assembles the window,
the live runs and the scheduler balance on the loop. The dependency
coordinator's FIRST build reads every waiting row (`rebuild`), so a coroutine
takes `SubagentManager.dependency_coordinator_async` — the run loop's dependency
arms do, and the gateway builds it off-loop
(`_ensure_subagent_coordinator`) before each loop-side wiring pass reads
`_subagent_dependency_coordinator`. `monitoring.taskq_coordinator` re-raises
`OnLoopStoreError` out of its rebuild guard rather than reporting it as a failed
rebuild, so an armed run names the on-loop caller instead of silently restoring
nothing.

Every remaining class is an ORDERING problem rather than un-offloaded work —
which is the whole of why `dev_mode_arms_strict` is still `False`, and the only
thing that would flip it: both classes below have to be restructured or wrapped
in a vetted `allow_on_loop()` block first, because arming it while either stands
raises on an ordinary cancel or Stop-all and the developer's rational response
— unsetting the variable — silences every other surface's guard too. Volume is
not the bar: closing the last un-offloaded WRITE (the drained defer, below) left
`False` exactly as it was. An un-offloaded READ is never one of these classes:
it is a defect, found with `TaskStore.loop_thread_calls` under an armed pin (see
`TestStoreOffLoop`), because a `try/except Exception` around a caller swallows
the guard's raise.

- the terminal write on an unwinding arm (`except CancelledError` /
  `except BaseException` in `taskrunner`, `workflows.agent_pool`, and both the
  `waiting_dependency` cancel and `_end_row_on_cancel` — `admit`'s
  `CancelledError` arm, for a row whose handle never reached the caller — in
  `adapters.runner`) stays SYNCHRONOUS, because an
  `await` there can be interrupted before the write is submitted and a dropped
  terminal write leaves the row active for the next boot's reconciler;
- `admission.taskq_cancel_queued`, reached from a single `cancel`
  (`cancel_impl`), has to cancel the row before a drain can claim it AND drop it from
  the window before a stagger timer can start it — an await between those two is
  a race in either order, so closing it is a restructure, not an offload. (Its
  OWN read-then-cancel window is closed inside the store instead: § A cancel
  whose PRECONDITION came from an earlier read.) Stop all is that restructure,
  and no longer in this class: `taskq_post_cancel_queued` QUEUES one
  writer-thread job for every row (`taskq_cancel_queued_each`) and only then
  are the window entries dropped, both before the first await, so a refill or
  a claim queued afterwards lands behind the cancels; a refill fetch queued
  before it is fenced by the parent's `_stopping_parents` mark, which keeps
  `_refill_apply` from windowing that parent's rows. An inline pump is not
  ordered behind that thread, so there the job runs inline, as
  `_post_store_write` does.

**The DRAINED spawn's defer is offloaded, boolean and all.** Its write is on the
pressure path, so a locked database once held chat and the heartbeat for the
whole 2 s busy timeout: `gate.py`'s `_deferred` takes `store.defer` inline, and
`spawn_impl` is a SYNC frame the pump reaches through `self._manager.spawn(...)`,
so the fix is neither an `await` in place nor discarding the answer. What made
the write look un-offloadable was its BOOLEAN — `_from_queue` does not prove a
row exists, because `_queue` also holds entries that never reached the store, so
posting the write (`taskq_defer_posted`, correct for the ACCEPT path, whose row
this very call wrote) would park a handle for a row no dispatch will ever pick.
Keeping the boolean while moving the wait needs neither: it is the SEAM the
claim already uses. Under `_stop_before_claim` — the flag that says the caller
is the coroutine dispatcher — `_deferred` decides BOTH answers, parks them as a
`DeferPoint` (`admission.park_defer`) and returns the queued one;
`_dispatch_async_impl` then awaits one writer-thread submission through
`admission.finish_parked_defer`, schedules the pump wake and re-emits the queue
depth. No slot is reserved at that point (the gate returns before the claim), so
unlike a `ClaimPoint` there is nothing an await can leak.

The one new interleaving is a Stop-all landing between the pressure verdict and
the write, and `defer`'s own `state IN <claimable>` predicate is its fence. But
the fence makes the write answer `False` for TWO different facts, and they owe
the requester different answers, so the row is RE-READ on the same submission
that wrote — never on a second one, which would be another window. No row at all
is the `_queue` entry that never reached the store, and its refusal is announced.
A row that exists and is past `CLAIMABLE` was cancelled under the await, and its
stop has already been reported by the canceller: the answer is the
`queued and done and user_stopped` shape `_after_dispatch_impl` swallows, so one
id never carries two contradictory terminal events — one saying the user stopped
it, one saying the host refused it. That is the same single-event outcome the
`ClaimPoint` window already has, reached by a re-read rather than by the
predicate alone. Pinned by
`test_overload_integration_glue.py::TestStoreOffLoop::test_a_cancel_inside_the_parked_defers_window_is_announced_once`,
which holds the writer thread inside `store.defer` while the loop cancels. The three callers with no loop to hand
the write to (sync `spawn`, the inline drain, `pump_off_loop=False`) keep the
inline write, and `_deferred`'s REFUSAL text and its single `_announce_rejection`
are the same on every path; only the parked path answers `queued` before the
write it defers has reported.
Pinned by `TestStoreOffLoop::test_the_drained_defer_writes_off_loop` (the
COUNTER, because this write sits inside the pump's `except Exception`, which
swallows the armed guard's raise) and
`::test_the_drained_defer_refuses_a_legacy_window_entry` (the boolean's
meaning), plus `test_admission_gate.py`'s
`test_queued_nonbatch_rejection_announced_exactly_once` for the one
announcement.

**The pump is a coroutine on the loop.** `_drain_queue()` stays the sync entry
every call site uses; on a running loop with a store it schedules ONE
`_drain_queue_async` task (a request landing while one runs is coalesced into
one more pass). That coroutine runs the wait-expiry sweep
(`taskq_expire_waits_store` on the writer thread, `taskq_expire_waits_apply`
on the loop) and the window refill (`taskq_refill_window_async`: `pending_lanes`
/ `fetch_dispatchable_fair` / `next_eligible_at` through `store.run`, the
eviction and the append on the loop) BEFORE the sync pick-and-spawn half
(`_drain_queue_sync_impl`, whose *refill* callable is then a no-op).

**The pick's LANE question is resolved off the loop too.** A window entry that
carries no `_lane` resolves its parent chain, and a parent with no live run is a
`store.get` (`lane_for_session`), so `resolve_window_lanes_async` answers it for
every such entry in one `store.run` and the map is handed down through
`_drain_queue_sync_impl(lanes=)` → `pick_window_index(lanes=)` →
`lane_of_entry(params, resolved)`. Nothing awaits between the resolution and the
pick, so the window the map describes is the window picked from. The eviction
half gets the same map from `_refill_absent`, which already needs it on the
writer thread. Reached on the loop anyway — an entry that joined the window
during the resolve — `lane_for_session` stops at the key it has
(`store_reads_are_off_loop_here`), the way `pending_children` stops at its
cache: it decides which lane takes the next turn, so one pass of a nested row
counted under its own lane instead of its root's costs ordering, while the read
costs every session the busy wait. Pinned by
`TestStoreOffLoop::test_the_pick_resolves_a_lane_off_loop_not_on_the_parent_chain`
with the COUNTER, because the pump body's `except Exception` swallows the armed
guard's raise. The timer
pump (`taskq_pump`) runs its expiry sweep the same way. Without a running loop,
or with `SpawnAdmissionCoordinator.pump_off_loop=False` (the test suite's root
fixture and the virtual-clock experiment driver, which settle with `sleep(0)`
loops), the pump runs inline on the calling thread; the off-loop path is pinned
by `test_overload_integration_glue.py::TestStoreOffLoop` with nothing stubbed:
the dispatch of a picked row is split at the claim (`spawn_impl(...,
_stop_before_claim=True)` returns a `ClaimPoint` once every gate passed AND
the slot is reserved -- running count and stagger token taken synchronously,
so a concurrent admission during the await sees the cap spent;
`claim_and_start` awaits `store.run(taskq_claim)` and re-enters with
`_claimed=`, which consumes the reservation instead of re-checking capacity.
A pre-claim refusal releases it. Once the row is `admitted`, an unavailable
boundary-generation check moves the claim into the process-local
`_retained_claims` map with its reservation still spent; one retry timer opens a
later pump settlement pass, and that pass retries one retained generation before
ordinary refill. The map is bounded by already-reserved capacity. A successful
retry registers exactly once and consumes the reservation; a durable refusal
releases it). The same split serves the ACCEPT
path -- `spawn_async` awaits the window decision (`taskq_should_window_async`)
and the claim on the writer thread and posts a pressure defer
(`taskq_defer_posted`), so the sync re-entry with `_store_accepted` performs
no store I/O; while its awaits are in flight the row is in `_admitting_ids`,
which `taskq_excluded_ids` adds so the refill cannot start it a second time.
The pump must also never see the row before a pressure defer's `next_run_at`
is set. The defer write is QUEUED on the writer thread by the call that defers
(`_post_store_write` posts at call time, `TaskStore.post`), so it lands ahead of
any refill read queued after it, and `spawn_async` keeps the row in
`_admitting_ids` until that write has LANDED (`await_pending_defer`, shielded
from the caller's cancel). A cancel of the caller ends the wait early and
releases the row while the write is still in flight; the FIFO writer is what
still holds the invariant then. On the inline pump the write runs inline, so it
has landed before the call returns. When the call releases a row that may still
wait (the gate queued it, or the call ended without an answer) it runs one pump
pass: every pass during the call left the row out, and the slot one of them
would have given it may already be free. The
nested W3 branch (a child of a parent blocked in `spawn_sub_agents`) takes the
same route for event-loop callers: `taskq_child_registered_async` reads the
ledger's outstanding children and the parent's deadline on the writer thread,
yields the parent's slot on the loop, and posts `enter_wait` / `update_wait`
(`spawn_impl(_child_registration=False)` skips the inline branch). A re-entry
that raises releases the reservation like any other non-start
(`claim_and_start`'s `finally`, keyed on registration) -- the
registration and terminal writes (`taskq_mark`, `taskq_fail`, `taskq_settle`'s
`finish`) are POSTED to the writer thread through `_post_store_write` /
`store.run` -- the single worker keeps them in submission order, so
`admitted -> starting` lands before the run's later `running`, and a `starting`
that did not land at all is replayed by that later mark's own store phase
(`taskq_advance`, § The claim/start boundary) rather than leaving the row where a
reconcile requeues it blind -- and
`taskq_settle`'s tree propagation runs back on the loop after its write. The
queue-depth chip's `count_pending` and the child-reserve count
(`pending_children`, cached per pass by `refresh_pending_children_async`) read
on the writer thread too; the coordinator's one-time `rebuild` is done there on
the first pass (`ensure_coordinator_async`, also before the accept path's
re-entry). Every posted write and the pump task itself join `_report_tasks`
(`track_store_task`), the set `cancel_all` drains with a bounded wait, so a
terminal `finish` still on its way to the writer thread when the gateway stops
lands before the loop closes.

**A posted write and an inline write are not ordered against each other.** They
are ordered only WITHIN the posted set, by the single writer's submission order.
So a write whose precondition is another write must share its channel, and every
site on the wait/wake boundary is split explicitly into a DATABASE phase and a
loop-apply phase rather than dropping a whole coordinator into a thread:

- `yield_slot`'s `enter_wait` is POSTED, joining `taskq_mark` / `taskq_fail` /
  `taskq_settle`. The transition table accepts a wait only FROM `running` and
  the run's `running` mark is itself posted, so an inline wait write reaches a
  still-`starting` row on the run's FIRST frame batch, is refused, and the late
  mark leaves the row `running` with no durable wait reason
  (`test_runloop_integration.py::test_a_wait_in_the_first_frame_batch_lands_behind_the_running_mark`).
- The dependency path is the exception, and INLINE for a stated reason:
  `DependencyCoordinator.report`'s wait write chooses wait-vs-park from its own
  result in one critical section, so its `running` mark cannot be posted behind
  it. `_dependency_verdict` hands `(coordinator, store, task_id, signal,
  generation)` into `_dependency_report_db`, where the mark and `report` run as
  ONE unit through `store.run` (inline when there is no off-loop pump, where
  program order already holds). What it does NOT hand over is a decision about
  the mark: the mark is unconditional and `TaskStore.advance` is what decides —
  nothing written when the row is already `running`, the missed
  `admitted -> starting -> running` replayed when an earlier mark was lost to a
  locked database, and a refusal on a row another owner ended. Gating it on the
  in-memory `info._taskq_running_marked` is what this must never do, because that
  flag is published AHEAD of a posted write whose refusal reaches nobody. Without it the wait is refused, the row is PARKED in
  `retry_wait` — which has an edge to neither `running` nor `done` — and the
  completed run's terminal write is refused too, leaving finished work
  claimable. That refusal is deliberate, so it has to be AUDIBLE: `taskq_settle`
  reads `finish`'s boolean and, on a `False`, logs the row's actual state
  (`taskq_report_refused_settle`). Discarded, the closed edge became the quietest
  possible outcome instead of the loud one it was closed to produce. A refusal
  whose row already holds the state the write asked for lost nothing (another
  write settled it the same way first: a queued stop whose cancel did not land
  re-posts it ahead of its settle, and the re-posted cancel wins), so that one
  is logged at DEBUG. A
  queued stop whose own cancel landed (Stop all, the stage Cancel, a parent-end
  teardown, a single `cancel`) skips the write altogether
  (`taskq_settle(row_settled=True)`) and keeps only the propagation. Pinned
  through `taskq_settle` itself and not only through that helper
  (`test_subagent_dependency_mark.py`): a pin on the helper alone is satisfied by a
  settle that never calls it.
- `resume_grant` needs `wake_wait`'s new generation before it publishes, so it
  is awaited, not posted: the pump RESERVES the lane slot on the loop
  (`resume_reserve`, the same reserve-then-commit shape as `ClaimPoint`), the
  wake runs on the writer thread (`resume_grant_async`), and `_resume_publish`
  writes `_slot_released` / `_wait_record` / `_taskq_generation` and sets the
  resume event only from its result. `_resume_release` gives the reservation back
  on every other outcome.
- `DependencyCoordinator.tick()` runs through `store.run` from the monitoring
  loop, with only its `callbacks` on the loop.
- Child-terminal propagation is split the same way
  (`taskq_child_terminal_async`, `taskq_cancel_children_of_async`): offloading
  only the outermost `finish` and then reaching the `WaitLedger` from its
  callback puts the propagation's OWN writes back on the loop.
- The `RunnerAdmission` surface has async entry points for its event-loop
  callers: `accept_async` (the whole multi-statement accept as one unit),
  `claim_only_async`, and `Admitted.write_async` / `running_async` /
  `recovering_async` / `settle_async` / `done_async` / `fail_async` /
  `cancel_async`, plus `recorded_answer_async` / `consume_answer_async` for the
  operator-answer replay the step body drives. `admit` routes each of its own
  store touches through `_db`, and so do those two. A terminal write inside an
  `except CancelledError` arm stays SYNCHRONOUS on purpose: an `await` there can
  be interrupted before the write is submitted, and a dropped terminal write
  leaves the row active for the next boot's reconciler.

**A claim the store cannot take never starts a run.** `taskq_claim` returns
`(generation, proceed, reason)`; `TaskStoreUnavailable` during the claim is
`CLAIM_UNAVAILABLE` and `proceed=False`: the row stays `queued` on disk, the
caller keeps a QUEUED handle and the pump retries after the admit wait. Only a
row no store ever saw (legacy in-memory queue) proceeds at generation 0 -- a
run started without a lease would be invisible to reconcile and restartable
by the next pump.

**A corrupt file is quarantined, not obeyed.** `TaskStore.open` runs `PRAGMA
integrity_check`; SQLite's own damage verdicts (`file is not a database`,
`database disk image is malformed`, `malformed database schema`, a non-`ok`
check) move the file aside as
`tasks.db.corrupt-<utc-microseconds>Z-<pid>[-<n>]` -- the base name is reserved
by exclusive creation, so no quarantine ever overwrites an earlier one
(`test_two_quarantines_in_the_same_second_keep_both_copies`) -- with its
`-journal`/`-wal`/`-shm` sidecars moved first under the same name and the
database last (`test_stale_journal_is_quarantined_with_the_corrupt_file`); a
sidecar that cannot move is named in the warning, never a reason to raise.
The store then recreates the schema, logs once
at warning level and records the fact on `TaskStore.quarantined_to` /
`warnings`; `kirocrew doctor` reports any quarantined copy beside the live
file. Work accepted only into the old file is not recovered. Locked, busy,
disk-full, read-only, `unable to open` and a schema NEWER than this build stay
refusals (`_is_corruption` matches only those exact phrases), and doctor's
diagnostic open never moves anything.

**An enabled queue never falls back.** With `agent.task_queue_enabled` on, a
store that fails to open is recorded on the manager (`_taskq_unavailable`) and
EVERY spawn is refused typed (`task_store_unavailable`, naming the cause) --
never accepted into the in-memory queue a restart forgets. The runner adapters
are built with `require_store=True` for the same setting: `accept` and `admit`
raise `RunnerAdmissionRefused`; a failed `claim` raises too and starts nothing
(no generation-0 handle while the queued row stays dispatchable). The
lane-only, generation-0 shape exists ONLY when the queue is deliberately off.

**That refusal is not terminal, though.** Every condition kept as a refusal
instead of a quarantine -- locked, busy, disk-full, read-only -- is transient, so
a one-shot open would turn a two-second lock into a gateway that refuses every
spawn until someone restarts it. The reaper sweep therefore re-attempts the open
(`taskq_reopen_if_due`), on the shared recovery schedule
(`recovery/policy.py`'s `backoff_secs`: capped exponential backoff with equal
jitter, `agent.recovery_backoff_*` -- the same clock `dependency_backoff()`
uses), armed by whoever RECORDED the failure (`taskq_arm_reopen`, off the loop,
where the config is already in hand) so the delay runs from the failure rather
than from the sweep that notices it. An attempt is skipped while one is in
flight, before its deadline, and once a store is attached. The re-open is the
BOOT open repeated: schema, legacy import and reconcile all re-run through
`open_default_store` and the result attaches on the loop exactly as at boot,
which is safe because
- while the store is unavailable the manager holds no accepted work at all
  (every spawn was refused before queueing), so the process state at a retry is
  the boot state;
- the new incarnation's `reconcile_on_boot` examines rows not leased by it, and
  the `gateway.lock` singleton means no second gateway holds the same home,
  while `taskq_excluded_ids()` keeps the rows of runs live in this process --
  adopted orphans included -- out of the refill; and
- the store's consumers all bind it late (the runner adapters' `_store()`, the
  dependency coordinator's lazy build, the dashboard handlers' per-request read),
  so nothing needs re-wiring and the window is drained on attach.
A corrupt file is still quarantined at open rather than retried into, and the
attach is one-way: a re-open that finds no store never un-attaches one that
opened. Because the attempt re-reads the config, turning
`agent.task_queue_enabled` OFF while a refusal stands takes effect at the next
attempt (the in-memory queue) instead of at the next restart; turning it on
still needs a restart, since with the queue off there is no refusal to retry.

## Atomic claim, lease, generation

```sql
UPDATE tasks SET state='admitted', lease_owner=?, lease_expires_at=now+60,
                 generation=generation+1, attempts=attempts+1, next_run_at=NULL
WHERE id=? AND state IN ('queued','retry_wait','recovering')
  AND (next_run_at IS NULL OR next_run_at<=now)
  AND (lease_expires_at IS NULL OR lease_expires_at<now)
```

Zero rows affected means someone else has it (`claim()` returns `None`).
`claim_next(kind)` picks the oldest eligible row and claims it, retrying a
bounded number of times under contention. A claimed (`admitted`..`running`) row
is never re-claimed however stale its lease: a lapsed lease inside a live
process is a bug the reconciler surfaces, not a takeover.

Every write a run makes afterwards carries the generation it was dispatched
under (`transition`, `finish`, `record_progress`, `renew_lease`). A stale
generation is refused and recorded as `stale_result`, so a worker from
dispatch *n* can neither overwrite *n+1*'s outcome nor be reported twice.
`cancel()` bumps the generation as well as writing `cancelled`, which is what
makes cancel-vs-dispatch safe in either order: cancel first → the claim's
`WHERE state IN (...)` fails; claim first → the next fenced write (`starting`)
fails, and for the runner entries that refusal STOPS the start (§ The
claim/start boundary). On the subagent path that write is posted, so its refusal
reaches nobody. So the subagent claimer re-reads the row after its claim and
before it registers (`claim_and_start`, subagent.md § `spawn` step 5): a cancel
that landed before that re-read refuses the start there. The re-read is a read,
not a compare-and-set, so a store-only cancel (no `_agents` record, such as an
orphan cancel or reconcile) that commits after it answers and before the
claimer resumes still registers a run that finishes in memory. Stop all's queued
stop does not reach that window. Its batched cancel files the row in
`_batched_stops` before the stop first awaits, and a claimer that finds it there
waits for the batch's answer and re-reads behind the cancel. A single queued
stop installs a loop record, which the claimer checks after the re-read. The ROW is the cancel the operator asked for
and every later write of that run is fenced out as `stale_result`. Nothing is
re-dispatched either way.

#### A cancel whose PRECONDITION came from an earlier read

The order above is safe because the two writes fence each other. It says nothing
about a caller that first READ the row, judged it cancellable from that read, and
cancelled in a second call — an operator's `cancel_wait` on a parked row, the
Stop-all path's `taskq_cancel_queued`, `admit`'s own unwinding cleanup, the
queued-orphan sweep. Between the read and the write an admission can claim the
row and start it, and then the plain `cancel` does the one thing nothing else in
this store can do: it ends a row whose executor is LIVE and, by bumping the
generation, fences that executor out of its own settlement. Nothing settles the
work afterwards — not the owner (refused `stale_result`), not reconcile (the row
is terminal). A `cancelled` row with a running step under it.

So a cancel of that shape names the states it is willing to end and, when it
holds a row, the generation it read:

```
UPDATE tasks SET state='cancelled', generation=generation+1, lease_owner=NULL, ...
 WHERE id=? AND state=? AND generation=?          -- the state and generation READ IN THIS TX
```

`cancel(only_from=<states>, generation=<n>)` re-tests both inside the cancel's own
`BEGIN IMMEDIATE`, exactly as `claim`, `transition` and `update_wait` carry their
preconditions, and refuses with those methods' own two events —
`rejected_transition{from,to:cancelled}` for the state, `stale_result` for the
generation — answering `None` (`False` at the callers). No third refusal
vocabulary, and no second spelling of a conditional write.

The predicate has to ride in the `UPDATE`, not sit in a Python test above it: a
test over the row this transaction read is still a test over a stale snapshot, and
a refusal test that only fires when the row moved BEFORE the call is entered
cannot see the window this route exists to close. That is a property no other
assertion here can distinguish — hoisting the test out of the statement leaves the
rest of the suite green — so it is pinned on its own, by
`test_taskq_store.py::test_the_conditional_cancels_predicate_rides_in_the_write_not_in_a_python_test`,
which mutates the row from inside the cancel's transaction after its own read.

Callers:

| Caller | `only_from` | Refusal means |
|---|---|---|
| `RunnerAdmission.cancel_wait` (operator, `/api/tasks/{id}`) | `PARKED` | the row went live or moved on: 409, and the live lever is `/cancel` |
| `admission.taskq_cancel_queued` (a single `cancel`, `_unqueue`, and Stop all's `taskq_cancel_queued_each`) | `CLAIMABLE + admitted` | the drain started it: the caller falls through to the live reap |
| `RunnerAdmission._end_row_on_cancel` (unwinding `admit`) | `queued` | another admission owns the row; its own path settles it |
| `adopt_orphaned_rows`' never-started sweep | `queued` | an `accept`/`admit` re-attached it while the sweep ran |

Cancel-from-anywhere stays the DEFAULT, because three callers mean it and would
be wrong to narrow: `WaitLedger.cancel_tree` (the operator's Stop-all cascade —
the manager reaps the live runtime itself, children first), `WaitLedger.rebuild`'s
orphaned-children pass and reconcile's tombstone verdict (boot, over rows whose
incarnation is gone, and "the parent is terminal" is a judgment no later state
change can falsify).

### The claim/start boundary

`admitted` is the store's statement that **no executor has ever held the row**,
and the boot reconciler spends that statement: it requeues an `admitted` row
without asking the side-effect class (§ Reconcile-first boot). So the
`admitted → starting` write is not bookkeeping, it is the fence the requeue
rests on, and a caller may execute only once it has COMMITTED:

- `RunnerAdmission.admit` returns a handle only after `write_async(STARTING)`
  committed. A refused write releases the lane slot, puts the row back
  (`admitted → queued`, generation-fenced, so a row a cancel already ended keeps
  that outcome) and raises — `RunnerTaskCancelled` when the row ended,
  `RunnerAdmissionRefused` otherwise. `claim_only` answers `None` on the same
  refusal: a container row driven through a handle whose row is still `admitted`
  is one the adopter would settle as never started. A requeue the store cannot
  take either leaves the row `admitted` under a lapsing lease, which is the
  disposition reconcile already gives it — and correct, because nothing ran.
  Because reads are typed, `_requeue_unstarted`'s `None` answers TWO refusals that
  leave different rows: that one, and a requeue that COMMITTED where only the
  read-back failed, leaving `queued`. So the `None` names no state, and neither
  does its warning — both refusals are unstarted and claimable again, which is all
  it may claim (`test_taskq_runner_adapter.py`, one case per refusal).
  **What that `None` costs, and why it is a cost and not a leak.** The requeued
  `queued` container row has no dispatcher (`fetch_dispatchable_fair` is only ever
  called with `KIND_SUBAGENT`) and the boot reconciler is ACTIVE-only, so it
  lingers for the rest of THIS gateway's life; the adopt sweep skips it too,
  because `params.accepted_by` names an incarnation that is still running. It is
  bounded, not permanent: the next boot's `adopt_orphaned_rows` cancels it as
  never started (`_NEVER_STARTED`). Re-adopting it inside the run instead would
  mean driving the run without the handle the fence just withheld, which is the
  thing the fence exists to prevent — so the garbage is the deliberate trade.
- The subagent path cannot fence the same way: `spawn` is synchronous and the
  run task exists before the mark goes out, so the mark is POSTED
  (`taskq_mark`). What is guaranteed there instead is that a lost mark cannot
  keep a LIVE row in `admitted`: `TaskStore.advance` reads the row's own state
  and replays the missed step through `model.steps_to`, so the run's `running`
  mark at its first stream event lands as `admitted → starting → running`.
  **Every mark on this path reaches that one store method** — `taskq_advance`
  for the posted marks and `RunEventCoordinator._dependency_report_db` for the
  dependency park's inline one — because the guarantee belongs to the store and
  not to whichever caller reached it. A `transition` called directly from a
  second mark site is the defect this shape closes: with the start mark lost, a
  dependency park refused the `running` mark, then the wait (reachable only FROM
  `running`), then the coordinator's `retry_wait` fallback (`admitted →
  retry_wait` is not an edge either) — three `rejected_transition` events, a LIVE
  run on a dependency backoff, and a row the next boot requeues blind
  (`test_subagent_dependency_mark.py`).
  Its residual is one crash window — a row whose start mark was refused AND that
  never reached a later mark — which closes only with a durable pre-start marker
  (RFC §4.4 `start_attempt`).

Lease: `LEASE_SECS` = 60. The subagent adapter renews at the `running` mark
(written at the run's first stream event); the runner adapters renew through
`Admitted.renew`. A `running` row is not claimable, so the lease is
load-bearing only once a row is `recovering` — periodic renewal from the run
loop is deliberately not added (the reaper sweep is `LEASE_SECS`).

## Bounded dispatch window

The store keeps no dispatch state in memory. Its one in-memory fact is an
index, not a decision: the ids of rows in a claimable or `admitted` state
(`TaskStore.is_unstarted`). It is loaded at `open`, written through after the
commit of every state write, and readable on the event loop without SQLite. The
subagent done-probe's `is_queued` reads it ([subagent](subagent.md) § Fairness
lanes). The adapter's in-memory queue
(`SubagentManager._queue`) is a FIFO window of at most `TaskStore.window`
(`agent.task_dispatch_window`, default 64) entries:

- A newly accepted row joins the window only when there is room AND no older
  row is waiting outside it (`count_pending(exclude_ids=window ∪ {new})` is
  0). Otherwise it is store-only.
- The drain refills the window lane-fairly (see § Fairness lanes) at the
  start of every pump and after every pop: first the head of every lane that
  has a store row waiting but no window entry (a window full of one lane
  drops that lane's youngest entries back to store-only to make room, never
  below one entry per lane), then `fetch_dispatchable_fair(kind, limit=room,
  exclude_ids=window)` — weighted round-robin across lanes, oldest
  `created_at` first inside a lane, deferred rows skipped. FIFO therefore
  holds inside a lane across the window boundary, and every pending lane is
  represented in the window.
- Depth for a parent = window entries for that session that are unstarted
  spawns (not a resident run's `_resume_id` entry unless it is a
  `_startup_release` start) + `count_pending(..., session_key=…,
  include_admitted=True)` outside the window: claimable rows plus `admitted`
  ones (a claim in flight, or retained across an outage) that no live run is
  registered for — the one "accepted, no run yet" definition the queued
  listing (`list_pending(include_admitted=True, app=…)`) shares. When the
  dashboard chip asks, a row the pump has popped and not yet claimed is left
  out (a row a `spawn_async` caller is still admitting does count once the
  gate has queued it), and so is a `recovering` row, in the store
  (`count_pending(include_recovering=False)`) and in the window (the refill
  marks its entry `WINDOW_ENTRY_RECOVERING`, and a gate re-queue of the
  still-unclaimed entry keeps it): claimable, but a run that had
  started and lost its owner, not one waiting for its first start. Every count
  of work still owed keeps it. Wave accounting consults `fetch_pending_by_batch`
  the same way.
- A parent-end teardown stops the parent's waiting rows the store accepted
  before its snapshot (`taskq_pending_ids_for_async(…, include_window=True)`,
  window rows included, live runs and rows a `spawn_async` caller is still
  admitting left out, less the ids the snapshot's fence recorded as accepted
  after it, by accept order rather than `created_at`, which a stepped-back
  wall clock would misorder), so a row held only by the store does not
  outlive the conversation that queued it, and a row a successor under the
  same key queued after the snapshot is never swept. A read the store refuses
  keeps the fence open and is retried by each reaper sweep until it lands. See [subagent.md](subagent.md) § `cancel_for_teardown`.
- When a pass finds nothing and the window is empty, the pump arms one
  `call_later` at `next_eligible_at`: the earliest moment a row held only by
  time (deferred by `next_run_at`, or leased by `lease_expires_at`) becomes
  claimable, over the same rows the pass read (its exclusions, and children
  only on a `children_only` pass), capped at `admit_wait_secs`. A row with
  neither time is no wake: a pass that left it out did so for a reason the
  clock does not change (a `spawn_async` accept in flight, a live run), and
  reading it as "due at 0" would re-run that empty pass on every loop turn. The delay
  is floored at `MIN_RECHECK_DELAY_SECS`; a wake more than a second overdue
  that still found nothing is logged at WARNING, at most once a minute.

## Fairness lanes (`lanes.py`; RFC §6, §13 Q5)

A **lane** is one root session's queue. `lane_key_for(session_key)` maps a
root: `cron:` / `cron_` / `hook:` / `webhook:` prefixes, `_hb`, `_bg` and the
empty key → `system`; any other key is its own lane. A nested row (a
subagent's child) inherits its parent's lane, which is the root's by
induction (`TaskStore._lane_in_tx`, inside the accept transaction); a row
whose parent is gone keeps its own `subagent:<id>` key rather than being
guessed into another lane. An explicit `params["lane"]` (the runner adapters
name the lane from the run's `source`) wins over derivation. The lane is a
column on the row, so `/api/tasks`, the health sampler and the dispatch
queries read it without a join.

Across lanes the dispatcher runs **smooth weighted round-robin**
(`LaneScheduler`): every pick adds each contending lane's weight to its
credit, takes from the lane with the most credit and charges it the total.
Equal weights are plain round-robin; weight 3 is three picks per round,
spread out. A tie on credit goes to the lane whose head has waited longest.
A lane with nothing pending is forgotten (`forget`), so a returning lane
starts even and is never owed a burst. Inside a lane the order is FIFO by
`created_at` — one session's own ordering is untouched.

Weights use `agent.lane_weights{lane: w}` (1..64), including `system`.
Every unlisted lane has weight 1.

Two store readers serve the dispatcher: `pending_lanes(kind, exclude_ids,
children_only)` → `{lane: eligible count}`, and `fetch_dispatchable_fair(kind,
limit, scheduler, exclude_ids, children_only, lanes, per_lane_limit)` — each
lane's oldest eligible rows (a window function, `ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION
BY lane ...)`) interleaved by the scheduler. `children_only` restricts the read
to nested rows (`parent_id` set): the rows allowed to take the reserved child
slot (see [subagent.md](subagent.md) § Fairness lanes and the child reserve).
The subagent manager keeps two scheduler balances — one for the window pick,
one for the store→window refill — so filling the window never spends the
credit the drain picks with. With one lane pending the fair order is exactly
`fetch_dispatchable`'s FIFO.

Metrics: a lane key is a session key and so never a metric attribute (the
`kirocrew.taskq.*` attribute sets are closed). Per-lane depth is exposed as
data instead: `GET /api/spawn/lanes` (`admission.lane_snapshot_async()`): per-lane
`queued` / `running` / `waiting` / `weight`, the scheduler credit, and the
`CapacityView` (`cap_total`, `roots_cap`, `running`, `child_reserve`,
`reserve_active`, `waiting_parents`, `lifted_from`). A closed
`lane_kind ∈ {system, session}` attribute on `kirocrew.taskq.depth` is left to
the health sampler.

## Deferral (memory pressure)

`defer(task_id, until, reason)` sets `next_run_at` on a claimable row and
appends `deferred`; the state does not change and the row holds nothing. The
subagent adapter calls it — instead of refusing — when the memory floor
(`check_memory_available`) says no, with `until = now + agent.admit_wait_secs`,
and arms a pump wake-up for then. The caller receives a `queued` id. With no
store (the feature is off) or no row to defer (an incognito or temporary
spawn), the start waits in the in-memory window instead, not eligible until the
same admit wait passes. A durable defer the store could not write (a `_queue`
entry it never saw, or the store unavailable) is refused as a store failure
(`task_store_unavailable`), never as a capacity verdict. Spawns do not read the posture tier
(`cached_admission_check`); `agent.admission_gate=false` turns it off for cron.
The macOS kernel memory-pressure hold is not a deferral: it
is a capacity-style wait in the window (subagent.md), and the runner lane,
cron and workflow `ctx.agent` gates deliberately do not read the kernel level;
only the subagent gate acts on it.

The wait is finite. `deferred_longer_than(kind, bound, *, exclude_ids, limit)`
is the one read that measures it: waiting rows (any state `defer` parks:
`queued`, `retry_wait`, `recovering`) still parked (`next_run_at` in the future) that have spent *bound* seconds parked in their current wait, oldest
first. The current wait is the `deferred` events after the row's last `claimed`
or `transition` event (the closers the queued listing applies); each one parks
the row from its `ts` to its `until`, cut short by the next deferral or by now,
and a gap between a lapsed deferral and the next one (the row eligible, waiting
to be picked) is not counted. Every re-check appends one more `deferred` event,
so a re-check never restarts the clock, and the newest event alone says nothing
about how long the row has waited. The subagent adapter fails each row it returns past
`agent.subagent_queue_max_wait_secs` with a generation-fenced `finish` and
reports `never started: waiting for memory`
([subagent.md](subagent.md) § Durable task queue).

That `finish` passes `report_owed=True`: the terminal `transition` event then
carries `report_owed_by` (the writing incarnation) in the same transaction, so
the report the commit still owes is durable. `mark_reported(task_id)` appends the
`reported` event that clears it (the adapter calls it once the report has reached
the parent, which for a wave member held for its digest is that digest's
delivery; a report that timed out or failed is not cleared, nor one whose
injection the gateway gave up on and swallowed), and `owed_reports(kind, *, limit, after)` names
the terminal rows whose owing incarnation is NOT this one and that have no
`reported` event after that transition, oldest terminal first (`updated_at`,
then `id`): what a later start has to report. `after` is the `(updated_at, id)`
of the previous page's last row, so a reader pages through every owed row
without re-reading one whose clear has not landed yet.

## Journal mode and network filesystems

WAL, `synchronous=NORMAL`, `busy_timeout` 2s. `detect_network_filesystem`
reads `/proc/mounts` (Linux; longest mount-point prefix), `statfs`
(`f_fstypename`, `MNT_LOCAL`; macOS) or — Windows having no mount table — the
volume ROOT's drive type (`platform_compat.path_volume_is_remote`, which reports
a UNC path and a mapped network drive alike as remote and asks about the root
alone, so a disconnected drive costs no SMB round trip). A network mount gets
`journal_mode=DELETE` and a warning in `TaskStore.warnings`.

**WAL needs a POSITIVE local answer; `None` is not `False`.** The detector has
three answers and every failure gives the third — an unreadable `/proc/mounts`, a
`statfs` that raised, `DRIVE_UNKNOWN` / `DRIVE_NO_ROOT_DIR`, a failed volume
query. Reading `None` as "local" would be a fail-OPEN on a durability control,
and it fails open in exactly the wrong place: the environment where a detector
most often cannot see the mount table is the network volume this branch exists
for, and WAL's shared-memory assumption is what SMB/NFS does not honour, so the
cost of guessing wrong there is a corrupt store — accepted work quarantined and
lost, which is the failure the durable queue was written to prevent. So `None`
takes DELETE with its own warning naming both why (undecidable, not remote) and
the single key that overrides it. DELETE is slower and correct everywhere, so the
conservative answer costs throughput and never correctness, and an operator whose
disk IS local keeps WAL by declaring it: `agent.task_store_journal_mode=wal`
forces the mode and the detector is never consulted. Pinned by
`test_taskq_store.py::test_an_undecidable_volume_takes_delete_rather_than_guessing_local`
(with the store then accepting and claiming a row in that mode, so the fallback
is proved usable rather than merely chosen) and
`::test_an_explicit_wal_override_still_wins_on_an_undecidable_volume`. A mapped drive onto a share on this same host reads as
remote and gets DELETE: the safe direction (slower, never a refusal), and
`agent.task_store_journal_mode=wal` overrides it.
`agent.task_store_journal_mode` (`auto` | `wal` | `delete`, RFC §13 Q6
reversal) is passed by `taskq_open` → `open_default_store(journal_mode=)` →
`TaskStore(network_fs=None|False|True)`: `auto` detects, the other two force
the mode and skip detection (a forced `delete` still warns, naming the key).
The store never refuses to open over the filesystem. `store.doctor_lines()` renders depth,
oldest wait and the warnings for `kirocrew doctor` (`doctor_checks/workload.py` prints
them under the task-store section).

## Legacy import (`migrate.import_legacy`)

Runs on every open before reconcile; keyed on id, so a second boot inserts
nothing. Sources:

| Source | Rows | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `<home>/subagents/<id>/state.json` without `tombstone.json` | `kind=subagent`, `state=recovering`, `attempts=1`, `result_ref=<folder>`, class `unknown` | the same set `list_orphans()` scans; a folder whose state names another id, or is unreadable, is skipped |
| TaskRunner `runs.json` entries with `status=="paused"` | `id=taskrunner:<task_id>`, `kind=taskrunner_step`, `state=recovering`, `scope_ref={"auto_approve": false}` | `runs.json` lives in the runner's work dir, so its path is a parameter of `open_default_store`; the persisted `auto_approve` is never carried |

Old files are never deleted or rewritten.

## Reconcile-first boot (`reconcile.reconcile_on_boot`)

Examines every `ACTIVE` row not leased by the current incarnation, once, before
any dispatch. Idempotent: a second pass over the same rows changes nothing, and
rows this incarnation has since claimed are skipped.

| Row | Verdict |
|---|---|
| terminal (incl. `cancelled`) | untouched — **cancelled never revives**, whatever the artifacts say |
| `artifact_probe(row)` says `done` / `failed` / `cancelled` | that terminal (subagent probe: a readable `tombstone.json` decides by its recorded `outcome`, through the same table as the live settle — `completed→done`, `stopped→cancelled`, `failed→failed`, so a `cancelled` tombstone recorded with `outcome: failed` settles `failed`, as the live settle did — then by its cause when it recorded none: `delivered→done`, `user_stop`/`parent_end`/`stage_cancel`/`cancelled→cancelled`, `error`/`timeout`/`turn_limit`/`child_escalation_limit`/`reaped`/`startup_timeout`/`start_queue_saturated→failed`; an unreadable one says nothing; with no tombstone, or cause `gateway_restart`, `done` when `subagent_persistence.result_is_whole` holds — the flag the orphan reconcile announces a finished run with — and nothing otherwise) |
| `admitted` | `queued` — claimed, never started, no side effect. The verdict is blind on purpose (no class, no probe), and what makes it sound is the claim/start boundary above: on the RUNNER path no executor holds a row that has not left `admitted`, because the `starting` write is a fence and no handle exists until it commits. The subagent path posts its mark instead, so its residual — a row whose start mark was refused AND that never reached a later mark (§ The claim/start boundary) — is exactly the row this verdict is blind about, and closes only with a durable pre-start marker |
| kind without a recovery adapter (today: everything but `subagent`) | state kept, lease dropped, `awaiting_adapter` event |
| class `unknown` | `unknown_side_effect` |
| class `none` / `idempotent_key` | `recovering`, `next_run_at = now + backoff(attempts)` (`2·2^attempts`, cap 120s); the dispatcher re-claims it |

The reconciler deliberately still examines only `ACTIVE` rows: it is
kind-agnostic, and a CLAIMABLE row is normally its dispatcher's — a `queued`
`subagent` row is exactly what the window refill exists to pick up. The
`queued` rows of a kind with NO dispatcher are therefore the kind-scoped
adopter's half of the job (§ Runner adapters, `adopt_orphaned_rows`), and the
two are complementary rather than overlapping: the adopter also picks up the
row this table just requeued from `admitted`, which for such a kind would
otherwise sit claimable with nothing to claim it.

## Waits (`waits.py`)

Every pause is a wait with a reason (SPEC-ADDENDUM §1-3, RFC §14.1-14.3).
A live run that cannot progress enters a `WAITING` state carrying a
`WaitRecord` on the row (`wait_json`) and in `task_events`:

```text
WaitRecord {state, reason, since,
            resume_condition {kind: at_time|signal|children|input|permission, at, key, ids},
            dependency_scope, cancel_semantics: cancel_call|cancel_task|cancel_tree,
            evidence_source: execution_layer|liveness_oracle|dependency_adapter,
            checkpoint_ref, tool_call_id, deadline_at,
            slot_released=True, residency_charged=True}
```

`model_text` is a named evidence source precisely so it can be REFUSED: a
record built from it alone raises. `state` and `resume_condition.kind` must
agree (`children`↔`waiting_children`, `permission`↔`waiting_permission`,
`input`↔`waiting_input`, `at_time|signal`↔`waiting_dependency`).
`residency_charged` cannot be False on a record: reclaiming the runtime is a
separate act (`park`), never an edit.

Identity, execution quota and real resources are three things on every entry
([RFC §14.2](../../request-for-change/rfc-overload-resilience.md#142-yielding-identity-quota-and-real-resources-are-three-things));
here the quota is `SubagentManager._running_count` (decremented, pump run) and
the record on disk is the identity.

| Kind | Detected by | Stored | Released | Retained | Wake event | On failure |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `waiting_children` (W3) | admission, from the parent's trusted in-flight tool (`_meta.kiro` `tool_name` ends in `spawn_sub_agents`) when a child registers or queues under `subagent:<id>` | row `wait_json{ids}`, `parent_id`/`root_id` on the children | lane slot | parent runtime residency | LAST awaited child terminal (`WaitLedger.on_child_terminal`) → `wake` (generation+1) → resume entry at the FRONT of the pump → slot granted by capacity | `on_child_failure` param: `continue` (default) wakes on the last child whatever its state; `fail_parent` → parent `failed{reason=child_failed}`, remaining children cancelled (children first); `deadline_at` → `failed{reason=wait_deadline}` + the live run cancelled |
| `waiting_dependency` (W2) | dependency adapter (`DependencySignal`, `dependency.py`) | `wait_json{dependency_scope, at_time|signal}` | lane slot | runtime residency until parked | `WaitLedger.signal(scope)` / `due_dependency_waits` → wake; the coordinator meters by capacity | coordinator caps / `deadline_at` → `failed`; `park` → `retry_wait` when the idle runtime is reclaimed |
| `waiting_input` (W4) | tool layer (interactive classifier / oracle `STUCK_INPUT`) | `wait_json{tool_call_id}` | lane slot | the blocked process | user input routed to the call → wake; `cancel_call` cancels the call, the task continues | `deadline_at` → `failed` |
| `waiting_permission` (W5) | approval broker | `wait_json{approval id}` | lane slot | runtime residency | approval decision → wake | rejection fails the call, task continues; `deadline_at` → `failed` |

`WaitLedger` (store-backed, stateless): `enter` (`running → state`, same
generation -- only correct behind a LANDED `running` write, which is why
`yield_slot` posts its `enter_wait` onto the same writer thread as the mark
rather than hoping about timing), `wake` (`→ running`, generation+1, lease
refreshed -- the
re-admission fence: a callback from the wait period carries the old generation
and is `stale_result`), `park` (`→ retry_wait`, the one write that ends the
residency charge), `fail`, `on_child_terminal`, `cancel_tree` (children first),
`expire` (deadlines → `failed`), `signal`, `rebuild` (boot: wake parents whose
awaited children are all terminal, cancel non-terminal children of a terminal
parent -- `orphaned_children`, fail past deadlines; idempotent). `store.cancel`
clears `wait_json`; every exit from a wait clears it.

**Each ledger fence is pinned on BOTH halves.** A refusal-only test passes just
as happily when the fence is widened to nothing (the argument dropped: the store
default is "no fence") as when it is narrowed to something no live caller can
satisfy, so `test_taskq_waits.py` asserts, per fence, the refusal AND the commit:
a caller from a generation the row has left gets `stale_result` with the wait
record and its residency charge untouched, and the same call under the row's live
generation moves the row. `enter` and `wake` carry both halves (`wake`'s state
half too -- a non-waiting row is refused); `park` and `fail` are the two whose
refusal half is only reachable through the ledger, since the deadline sweep and
`on_child_terminal` call them with no generation at all.

**Re-admission never bypasses admission.** A wake writes `running` in the
store but the run holds NO slot until the pump pops its `_resume_id` entry
(`admission.request_resume` / `resume_grant`): capacity and the stagger apply,
so a dependency recovering for 500 waiting trees produces 500 rows eligible
for re-admission, not 500 simultaneous runtimes. Resume entries sit at the
front of the window because the run is already resident. Between the wake and
the grant the run is `_resume_pending`; `admission.resume_granted(id)` answers
whether it holds a slot again.

**A wake writes `running` only with the slot in hand.** `store.wake_wait(...,
to=)` / `WaitLedger.wake(..., resident=)` have two targets. `resident=True`
(`to=running`) is used by exactly one caller, admission's `resume_grant`, which
runs AFTER the pump reserved the slot for a run whose runtime is still resident
— and it is the PRECONDITION for the publish, not a write beside it. The
in-memory slot, the generation and the resume event appear only once that wake
landed. A store failure leaves the run parked on its bounded
`_await_lane_resume` timeout (the existing path for a wait that never woke) with
the reservation released; a row that is not waiting and not `running` (a
`retry_wait` park, a terminal row, a generation another incarnation moved past)
means the row went out from under this run, so the grant is refused too. The one
benign refusal is a row already `running`: its wait write was refused or is
still on the writer thread behind the wake, and `running` is the state a granted
resume wants anyway. A run with no row at all (the legacy in-memory queue) is
granted — there is no durable state to protect and refusing would strand a
resident run.
Every other wake -- a `waiting_input` answer, a dependency scope recovering for
a parked row, the boot `rebuild`, the runner's own waits -- lands in
`retry_wait` with `next_run_at = now`, no lease and a new generation: claimable
at once, so the dispatcher (or the runner's `_resume_after_wait` → `admit` →
`claim`) writes `running` when capacity is actually granted. A crash in the gap
leaves a claimable row (`retry_wait` is not ACTIVE, so the boot reconciler
leaves it alone) instead of a dead-owner `running` row that reconciles to
`unknown_side_effect`. For a LIVE parent whose last child ended,
`on_child_terminal(defer_wake=True)` records `children_settled` and leaves the
row `waiting_children` until `resume_grant`. `answer_input` stores the answer
text on the `wake` event so a crash cannot lose it: `waiting_input` reads the
RAM copy first and falls back to `recorded_answer` (the latest `wake` event's
`answer` not yet followed by an `input_consumed` event), and a step
re-dispatched by a NEW incarnation restores it the same way -- `execute_task`
appends the recorded answer to the step before its first attempt and marks it
consumed (`consume_answer`) -- but only once the step has durably COMPLETED
(`execute_task` records `input_consumed` with the `PASSED` result), so a crash
between applying the answer and the turn finishing leaves it replayable
(`test_taskq_answer_replay.py`). The
window refill excludes
every row with a live run in this process (`taskq_excluded_ids`), so a
momentarily claimable row never starts a second copy of a resident run.

**A runner wait's WRITE is the precondition for parking on it, both paths.**
`WaitLedger.wake` only moves a row the store has in a WAITING state, so a handle
that published `waiting_input` over a REFUSED `enter_wait` awaited an event
nothing could send — an unbounded `await`, not a lost answer — while
`answer_input` refused the operator against a row that was not waiting. So
`waiting_input` reads its write's boolean exactly as `yield_dependency` reads
`parked`: a refused write reacquires the lane slot and returns `None` (the
documented "the wait ended without an answer"), so the step is one that did not
complete rather than one that never returns.

**`_resume_after_wait` writes `running` unconditionally**
(`Admitted.write_async`, never `running()` / `running_async()`): those
short-circuit on `_state == RUNNING` WITHOUT a store call, so a resume returning
one would answer True from memory over a row the wake left `starting`. `admit`
has just committed `starting` on the row it handed back, so the edge is always
available and the boolean is always the store's. Both pins, plus the coupling the
write depends on — each wait path publishes a WAITING `_state` before it awaits —
are in `test_taskq_runner_adapter.py`.

**Terminal writes are retried, never forgotten -- and durable by reconcile.**
A pending terminal write (`defer_terminal_write`) keeps the row `running` under
this incarnation's lease and generation: nothing releases the lease, a running
row is not claimable, so no second copy starts while the write is owed. If the
process dies before `retry_terminal_writes` lands it, the row is a dead-owner
`running` row and the next boot settles it exactly like any crash mid-run:
`reconcile_on_boot` -> `awaiting_adapter` -> `adopt_orphaned_rows` (runner
kinds) -> `unknown_side_effect` for the default class, `recovering` /
re-dispatch for retry-safe work
(`test_taskq_runner_adapter.py::test_crash_during_a_deferred_terminal_write_reconciles_the_row`).
The pending write is therefore NOT persisted as its own event: the row's own
state plus the lease already say everything reconcile needs, and a second
record would only add a place for the two to disagree. `Admitted.settle` performs
the terminal `finish` FIRST; only a committed write (or a write fenced by a
newer generation, i.e. another owner ended the row) settles the handle. If the
store is unavailable the write is handed to `RunnerAdmission.defer_terminal_write`
and replayed until it commits by whoever touches the store next: the pump's
`taskq_retry_terminal_writes` on the writer thread (the driver in practice — a
bound coordinator is what keeps `RunnerAdmission.tick` from running again at all)
and `admit`, which replays owed writes ahead of its own claim because a kept write
nothing replays leaves a finished unit's row `running` and leased for the life of
the process. `tick()` calls it too, and on a store-less admission all three replay
nothing: `retry_terminal_writes` returns 0 at its first line. The handle
is then settled and the lane slot released, but the task is NOT forgotten while
its write is outstanding (`stats()["pending_terminal_writes"]`).

**Nested S → A → B.** B waits (W2); A, blocked in `spawn_sub_agents`, is in
W3 with `ids=[B]`; S likewise. The chain holds zero lane slots. Siblings without
a dependency keep running. B ends → A wakes and is re-admitted; A ends → S.
Downward: a CANCELLED parent cancels its children (`taskq_cancel_children_of`);
a `done`/`failed` parent leaves them running (results delivered by id).
Upward: per the policy above. Restart: `parent_id` links and wait records are
rows; the reconciler settles the dead owner's `WAITING` rows like any ACTIVE
row (class `unknown` → `unknown_side_effect`, never a revival), then `rebuild`
cancels orphans.

## Dependency waits (`dependency.py`, `adapters/`)

An external dependency — the GitHub API, an HTTP host, a model provider —
refuses work for a while. Every entry point used to notice that on its own and
run its own retry loop, so five sessions hitting one GitHub rate limit produced
five backoff timers and five simultaneous retries when it lifted. Two things
replace that (RFC §14.4, SPEC-ADDENDUM §4):

### `DependencySignal`

The ONE shape every adapter translates a service error into:

```text
DependencySignal {kind, dependency_scope, source, retry_at: float?, retryable: bool, detail}
```

| `kind` | Meaning | Retryable | Example shapes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `dependency_unavailable` | down or unreachable | yes | HTTP 5xx, `ECONNREFUSED`, `could not resolve host`, model capacity rollout, IAM propagation delay |
| `rate_limited` | up, asked us to slow down | yes; `retry_at` honoured exactly | GitHub 403/429 with `X-RateLimit-Reset` / `Retry-After`, GraphQL `RATE_LIMITED`, Bedrock `ThrottlingException`, any HTTP 429 |
| `concurrency_exceeded` | too many in flight from us | yes | Bedrock `ServiceQuotaExceededException` |
| `quota_exhausted` | an allowance is spent until it resets | only with a known `retry_at` | `monthly usage limit`, `MonthlyLimitError` |
| `auth_failed` | credentials rejected or expired | **never** | 401, 403 (non-rate-limit), `bad credentials`, `AccessDeniedException`, session expired |
| `permanent_param_error` | the request itself is wrong | **never** | 404, 422, `could not resolve to a repository`, `Improperly formed request` |

`retryable` is forced `False` for the two terminal kinds and for a quota
exhaustion with no reset time. `dependency_scope` names the shared budget:
`github:api` (primary limit, per token, whole REST API), `github:graphql`,
`github:secondary`, `http:<host>`, `provider:<model>` / `provider:acp`. Every
task reporting the same scope waits on the same schedule; scopes never share
one.

`classify_exception(exc, scope)` runs the registered adapters in order —
`github` (headers, GraphQL `errors[]`, `gh` stderr wording), `http` (status
codes, `Retry-After` delay-seconds or HTTP-date, `X-RateLimit-Reset` epoch,
duck-typed over `urllib`/`aiohttp`/`httpx` error shapes) and `acp_provider`
(reuses the ACP layer's own throttle / usage-limit / auth / 5xx patterns and
`_is_transient_raw_error`, defined in `acp.transport_errors` and read through
`acp.client`, so a third copy cannot drift) — and returns the
first match, or `None` when the error is not a dependency error at all. An
exception carrying a pre-attached `dependency_signal` wins outright, and an
`AcpProcessDied` flagged `ambiguous_delivery` is never a dependency error, whatever
its text: the wait would end in a re-run of work that may already have run.
`register_adapter(name, fn, first=False)` adds one; an adapter that raises is
skipped. The two GitHub monitors (`monitoring/github_pull_request.py`,
`monitoring/github_workflow_run.py`) map `adapters.github.parse_gh_stderr()`'s
category onto `ProviderErrorKind` instead of each carrying its own parser.

### `DependencyCoordinator`

One `ScopeSchedule` per `dependency_scope`; the rules:

| Rule | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| one schedule per scope | the first `report(task_id, signal)` creates it; later reports JOIN it (no second timer). A later server-stated `retry_at` extends it; an earlier one never shortens it |
| honour the server | `retry_at` (`Retry-After` / `X-RateLimit-Reset`) is used exactly and is not clamped by the backoff cap. A RECORDED server instant (`ScopeSchedule.server_retry_at`) still ahead of now is a FLOOR under every later recomputation for that scope: a headerless failure or an earlier server statement can only leave it where it is. A ramp batch fails item by item and only some members carry a header, so without the floor one headerless 503 would discard the reset a sibling's 429 stated and retry against a dependency that said it would refuse. Two exits only: the instant passing (after which the ladder resumes normally) and `recovered(scope)` |
| bounded backoff | otherwise the shared recovery schedule (`recovery/policy.py` `LayerPolicy.backoff_secs`: `raw = min(agent.recovery_backoff_max_secs, base·2^(attempts-1))`, `delay ~ U[raw/2, raw]` — equal jitter; `dependency.dependency_backoff()` builds it from `RecoveryPolicy.from_config`) — a dependency wait has no backoff keys of its own |
| one attempt per scope | when the scope is due, exactly ONE waiter is woken as the probe (`phase=probe`). A report from a waiter the scope WOKE (`in_flight`) while that wake is still uncounted (`phase != waiting`, which only `tick()` moves it off) is the probe FAILING: `attempts += 1`, new backoff (never earlier than an unexpired server `retry_at`), back to `waiting` — once for the wave however many of its members report, so a capacity-sized ramp costs one probe and not one per woken task. A task the scope never woke is a JOINER whatever the phase: `dependency_max_attempts` bounds probe CYCLES, and charging a newcomer's own first failure to that budget makes `attempts` climb with arrival volume, failing every waiter in the scope well inside 20 real probes |
| staged wake by capacity | `wake_spacing_secs` after a probe that did not fail (or as soon as the probe completes, via `forget(task_id)`), the scope ramps: `wake_per_tick` waiters (0 = the current effective admission capacity) per spacing until none remain. A wake never bypasses admission — a live waiter goes `waiting_dependency → retry_wait` under a NEW generation (`WaitLedger.wake`, whose `resident=True` / straight-to-`running` form belongs to admission's own `resume_grant`) and is re-claimed through the lane; a parked one goes `retry_wait → queued` with `next_run_at = now` for the dispatcher to claim. The `dependency_wake` event's `to` is the state the row actually reached, `running` only on the delegated path where admission writes it |
| a wake the store could not write is not a wake | `WaitLedger.wake` raising `TaskStoreUnavailable` says nothing about the ROW: the waiter is put back on its scope one spacing out (as a refused delegated wake is), no `dependency_wake` event is appended and `tick()` does not report it woken. Read as "the row was parked in `retry_wait`" it would instead draw the `waiting_dependency → queued` write the transition table forbids, and the popped waiter — already reported woken — would be held by nobody. A REFUSED write (row gone, terminal, or under another generation) is the opposite answer: another owner's decision, so the waiter is dropped, again with no event |
| never infinite | `attempts > agent.dependency_max_attempts` or `now − since > agent.dependency_wait_deadline_secs` fails every waiter in the scope with the reason (`dependency_failed` event, `failed` row) and drops the schedule |
| terminal signals | `permanent_param_error` and a reset-less `quota_exhausted` → `failed` at once; `auth_failed` → `waiting_input` (`WaitRecord.input("auth:<scope>")` — signing in is real user input) when the row is running, else `failed`. Never scheduled, never retried |
| fault isolation | `tick()` handles each due scope independently; a throttled scope never delays another scope's wake, and a scope's failure fails only its own waiters |
| `recovered(scope)` | an external recovery signal makes the scope due now; the wake is still staged (probe, then batches) |

Where a waiter is parked: a LIVE run (`running`) enters `waiting_dependency`
with `WaitRecord.dependency(scope, since, retry_at, deadline_at = since +
wait_deadline)` — the row keeps its runtime resident and releases its lane
slot (W2 in RFC §14.1); a row that is not running yet (`starting`) is parked in
`retry_wait` with `next_run_at` = the scope DEADLINE, deliberately not the
retry instant, so the dispatcher cannot pick it up on its own and bypass the
staged wake (that eligibility is the safety net for a process that dies before
`rebuild()` runs).

**The verdict says where the wait landed, and whether it landed at all.** The
wait write has three outcomes and the caller acts on a different one in each:
`Verdict(wait, state=waiting_dependency)` (a live run entered the wait),
`Verdict(wait, state=retry_wait)` (the row was not live and is re-dispatched
later), and `Verdict(unpersisted)` — the store took NEITHER write, so NO row
records the wait. A caller must not park on that last one: `rebuild()` cannot
restore a wait no row is in, no boot sweep sees it, and the row is left in the
state it was reported from (`running`), so nothing outside that caller's own
process knows a wait is in progress at all. `unpersisted` still carries the
scope's `retry_at`, so a caller can retry locally the way the coordinator-less arm
of `RunnerAdmission.yield_dependency` already does with an `enter_wait` that did
not land. A store OUTAGE is never answered
with a park: `retry_wait` has an edge to neither `running` nor `done`, so a live
run parked there would have its own terminal write refused too. The waiter is
dropped from the schedule with the verdict, because a schedule holding a waiter
its caller was told to abandon would wake a row this coordinator never wrote.
One consequence to keep in mind when writing a test: a `report()` for a task id
with NO row is `unpersisted`, not a wait — the coordinator refuses to schedule a
caller that holds no task row, as `shared_retry_at` already states.

Persistence: the schedule is in memory; every entry appends
`task_events(kind="dependency_wait", {signal…, retry_at, server_retry_at,
attempts, since, state})`, every wake `dependency_wake` and every give-up
`dependency_failed`. Both instants are the SCHEDULE's as of that report, not the
reporter's signal: `server_retry_at` is the scope's recorded floor (`null` when
it has none), which is why it is a key of its own and never folded into
`retry_at`.
`rebuild()` after a restart re-joins every `waiting_dependency` row (scope,
since and `retry_at` from its `WaitRecord`, attempts from its newest
`dependency_wait` event) and every `retry_wait` row whose newest
`dependency_wait` is newer than its newest `dependency_wake`/`dependency_failed`;
a scope's `retry_at` / `attempts` / `since` are the latest / max / earliest
across its waiters, so a scope that was mid-backoff resumes it instead of
retrying at once. The floor is restored the same way (latest across the
waiters), so a restart cannot turn an authoritative deadline back into a ladder
delay; a row written without the key restores no floor rather than failing the
rebuild, and a restored instant that has already passed is no floor either, so
the floor can never outlive the reset it states. `next_deadline()` tells the
pump when to call `tick()`.

`coordinator_from_config(store, agent_config, capacity=..., on_wake=...)`
builds it from the `agent.dependency_*` keys.

**Run-loop wiring (X1).** The subagent manager owns ONE coordinator (`subagent_manager/monitoring.py::taskq_coordinator`, built lazily from `agent.dependency_*` over the admission store, `capacity = manager._max_concurrent`, registered via `register_coordinator`; `current_coordinator()` / `shared_retry_at(scope)` are the read-only accessors for callers with no task row, e.g. the main chat). Two seams distinguish a LIVE run from a parked row on wake: `wake_through(task_id, generation) -> bool` is asked before the store wake — `True` means the manager owns a yielded live run and has queued its `request_resume`, so the coordinator writes only the `dependency_wake` event (`via: admission`) and admission's `resume_grant` performs the `wake_wait` under the run's own generation (one wake, one write, no stale-generation fence); `False` keeps the row path (`ledger.wake` for a waiting row, `retry_wait -> queued` for a parked one, then `on_wake`). **On the worker path the seam is asked one tick LATE, so its refusal has to requeue.** `tick()` runs on the store's writer thread, where the seam cannot be called (it touches loop-owned manager state), so it POPS the waiter and hands `wake_through` back as a callback the loop runs — committing to delegation before the answer exists. A `False` or a raise then arrives on a waiter no schedule holds, and dropping it leaves the row unwoken with nobody owning it: the live run sits on a resume event nothing will set until its deadline cancels it. `_wake_through_or_requeue` therefore returns the waiter to its scope and re-arms `retry_at` one spacing out, which is the same answer the INLINE arm reaches by testing the boolean. A scope deleted meanwhile is NOT re-created — its last waiter left and the dependency recovered. Pinned by `test_dependency_coordinator.py::test_a_refused_delegated_wake_puts_the_waiter_back_on_its_scope`, the only test in the suite a commit-and-forget delegation reds. `on_fail(task_id, reason)` is told about every waiter a deadline or the attempts cap fails from `tick()` / `report()`, so a run parked on its resume event ends instead of waiting for a grant that will never come. **Those hooks are handed to the LOOP, because the give-up is the last releaser there is.** Both `on_wake` and `on_fail` end in a loop-affine `asyncio.Event.set()` — `SubagentInfo._resume_event`, `RunnerAdmission._wakes[task_id]` — and both `report()` and `tick()` run on the store's writer thread; a `set()` made there is not delivered to a loop that never wakes to see it, and after `_fail_scope` clears the schedule nothing else will release the scope's OTHER waiters. `tick()`'s worker path already defers them as `callbacks` the loop drains, and `report()`'s give-up has no such caller, so `DependencyCoordinator._on_hook_loop` marshals any off-loop emission with `call_soon_threadsafe` onto the loop it recorded when the hooks were registered (`subscribe`, or a loop-side construction) — the door `apps/event_bus.build_broadcast_fn` uses for the same reason. Pinned by `test_dependency_coordinator.py::test_a_report_driven_give_up_releases_a_parked_run_on_the_loop`, which asserts the THREAD: a loop that happens to wake for another reason hides a lost `set()` completely. **`_lock` is the schedule's, never a write's.** `report()` and `tick()` decide under it and take a `ScopeInstant` snapshot, then run every store write and every hook with it released: one `BEGIN IMMEDIATE` waits up to `BUSY_TIMEOUT_SECS` for a competing writer, and a batch of them under `_lock` would stall every loop-side reader of the same schedule (`forget`, `recovered`, `waiters`, `next_deadline`, `shared_retry_at`) for that many timeouts, with nothing in `store.loop_thread_calls` to show it because the loop thread never reaches the store there. It is the separation `TaskStore._executor_lock` keeps for the same hazard, pinned by `test_dependency_coordinator.py::test_the_schedule_lock_is_never_held_across_a_store_write`. The pump (`taskq_pump`) calls `tick()` at `next_deadline()` via a one-shot timer, from every reaper sweep, and whenever a run parks; `forget()` is called when a run reaches a terminal state. **A fired one-shot is SPENT, and `taskq_arm_tick` cannot tell that from the handle** — asyncio runs a timer whose `when` is within `loop._clock_resolution` of now (15.625 ms wherever `monotonic()` rides the system tick, against ~1 ns on Linux), so a pass re-entering through its own handle reads `loop.time() < handle.when()` and would dedup against itself, arming nothing for the next rung; since the one-shot is the only tick between sweeps, every waiter behind that scope would then wait for a sweep, or forever in a process with no reaper. The handle is therefore cleared by `_taskq_pump_fired` BEFORE the pass runs, which states the spent-ness the timer cannot. Pinned by `test_runloop_integration.py::test_the_ramp_is_woken_when_the_pump_timer_fires_inside_the_clock_resolution`. `admission.yield_slot(..., persist=False)` is the lane-slot release for a wait the coordinator already wrote. The sub-agent run's stop recovery uses the SAME wait shape without the coordinator: `WaitRecord.dependency("session:<stop class>", source=liveness_oracle)` + `request_resume` (see [subagent.md](subagent.md) § Stop reason → state); the gateway-capacity L1 rung joins the coordinator on scope `mcp_gateway:<class>` with the ladder's delay as `retry_at`.

## Runner adapters (`adapters/runner.py`)

TaskRunner steps and workflow `ctx.agent()` calls run on `SessionManager`
sessions, not on `SubagentManager.spawn`, so they cannot share that code path;
this module gives them the same contract over the same store.

Incognito and Temporary executions use `RunnerAdmission.in_memory()`: the
existing storeless admission path shares the same live lane, pressure checks and
retry timing. It does not attach the durable store or dependency coordinator, so
parameters, outcomes and waits cannot create task rows or replay after restart.
Persistent executions retain write-before-ack and lease-fenced settlement.

| Piece | What it is |
|---|---|
| `lane_for(session_key, source)` | `lanes.lane_key_for(session_key)` (the ONE lane-key policy) plus the runner's launch `source`: a `cron` / `hook` root is `system` whatever its key says. Stored on the row as `params.lane` and honoured by `_lane_in_tx`. |
| `owner_of(task_id)` | `(owner, run_id)` for a runner row id (`taskrunner:<run>[:task<N>]` → the TaskRunner run; `workflow:<run>:agent<N>` → the workflow run); the `/api/tasks/{id}/cancel` adapter routes on it: a parked row ends through `cancel_wait`, a row whose runtime is live (`starting`, `running`) cancels its run (`TaskRunner.cancel` / `WorkflowService.cancel`) -- a step is one unit of its run. |
| `RunnerLane(cap, mode=, pinned=)` | FIFO execution gate bounded by the LIVE effective cap. `cap` is a callable read on every decision (the factory passes `SubagentManager.max_concurrent`, already the controller's clamp under the user ceiling), so the lane always SEES the current cap — but reading it is not a wake. `pump()` is the raise EDGE, called from `SubagentManager._notify_cap_raised` through the `set_cap_raise_listener` handle the gateway installs, at BOTH the manager's raise sites (`set_effective_cap`, `apply_limits`). It has to be pushed: a waiter parked while the cap was `0` holds no slot, so no `release()` of its own will ever come, and `RunnerAdmission.tick` does not pump. `pump` grants exactly the FIFO prefix the new cap allows and nothing at all while the effective cap is still `0`, so a pause keeps pausing. `set_effective_cap(n \| None)` is the lane-local override (it pumps too); `mode=fixed` pins the bound at `pinned` (or the ceiling) whatever the controller says. Waiters hold a future, nothing else; no asyncio primitive exists at import or construction. `acquire(task_id, ancestors=)` books the slot to `task_id` (`holders`) and REFUSES rather than parks when the row's own ancestry holds every slot (§ A descendant is never parked behind its own ancestor) |
| `RunnerAdmission(store, lane=, pressure=, admit_wait_secs=, clock=, sleep=, ladder=, coordinator=)` | `accept(kind, task_id, ...)` writes the row before returning it (a `TaskStoreUnavailable` is `RunnerAdmissionRefused`: nothing accepted); an existing claimable / waiting row is returned, not duplicated (that is how a resume re-attaches) with `params.accepted_by` re-stamped to THIS incarnation (`TaskStore.restamp_accepted_by`) so the queued-orphan sweep cannot cancel a row the returning `admit` is about to park on, a terminal one gets a `~N` suffix. `admit(task_id)` runs the subagent order minus the policy refusals: pressure (`resource_status.cached_admission_check` shape) → `store.defer` + wait, a lane slot, `store.claim` → `starting`; a row cancelled meanwhile raises `RunnerTaskCancelled`. The `starting` write is a FENCE, not a mark: no handle exists until it commits, and a refusal releases the slot, requeues the row and refuses the admission (§ The claim/start boundary). A CALLER cancel delivered while `admit` waits (the pressure sleep, the lane slot, a deferred row's re-check, the `starting` write) is `admit`'s OWN to clean up: the lane slot goes back and the row is ENDED `cancelled` before the `CancelledError` is re-raised, because nothing ran under it and these kinds have no dispatcher — a row left claimable there would hold a queue place for as long as the store lives. Only two rows are its to end: one this call claimed itself (the generation it took fences the write) and one still `queued` and unleased (cancelled `only_from=queued` under the generation that read returned, so an admission that claimed it in between keeps it). `retry_wait` / `recovering` are excluded — the first can carry the operator's persisted answer, the second an attempt count, and `accept` re-attaches both on resume. `yield_dependency` owns its cancel the same way (the awaiting coroutine is the wait's only wake path in this incarnation); `waiting_input` deliberately does not. `claim_only` claims a container row without a slot, under the same fence. With no store the lane is the whole admission (legacy behaviour, never a refused run) |
| `Admitted` | the claimed row's handle: `running` / `progress` / `renew` / `settle` (`done` / `fail` / `cancel`, once; releases the slot), `recovering(reason, delay_secs)` (`running → recovering`, `next_run_at`, slot released) + `reclaim()` (a fresh claim = new generation; late writes are `stale_result`) |
| waits | `yield_dependency(handle, signal)`: coordinator `report` when one is attached (the scope's ONE schedule), else `WaitRecord.dependency` with `retry_at`; slot released, session resident; `tick()` / `signal(scope)` / the coordinator's `on_wake` resume it through capacity, and a `retry_wait`-parked row is re-claimed. Returns False when the wait ended terminal. `waiting_input(handle, tool_call_id)` ↔ `answer_input(task_id, text)` / `cancel_wait(task_id, generation=)`: the cancel is `only_from=PARKED` and, with a generation, fenced on it — False when the row is no longer the parked one the caller read, and then no wake is sent either |
| `decide_recovery(handle, unit, reason)` | the ladder's L3 verdict for one stalled turn (`None` without a ladder); `recovered(unit)` clears it |
| `adopt_orphaned_rows(store, kinds=, resume=)` | the recovery adapter for the kinds the boot reconciler stamps `awaiting_adapter`: `admitted → queued`; an unleased ACTIVE run row that `is_safe_retry` (`params.safe_retry`, or class `none` / `idempotent_key`) → `recovering` + `resume(rec)`; not safe → `unknown_side_effect` (never re-run blind); step rows (`parent_id` set) → `failed` when safe (the run's resume re-runs them from its checkpoint) else `unknown_side_effect`; rows this incarnation still leases are skipped. It ALSO settles the `queued` rows of its kinds that a previous incarnation accepted and never claimed → `cancelled` ("never started"), counted in `AdoptReport.cancelled`: nothing ran under such a row, so `unknown_side_effect` would be a lie, and a resume is a new row anyway. The owner test is `params.accepted_by` (the accepting `TaskStore.incarnation`), NOT the lease — a queued row has never been claimed and so has no lease, and a row this incarnation just accepted, or RE-accepted (`accept` re-stamps it), is waiting for a lane slot inside a live `admit`. The cancel itself is `only_from=queued` under the generation the scan read, because the re-stamp and the `admit` that follows it are two writes and a sweep beside a live gateway can run between them. `retry_wait` / `recovering` are left alone (persisted answer, attempt count, and `recovering` is ACTIVE so the reconciler already sees it). The `queued` scan PAGES until each kind is drained (`_ADOPT_SCAN_PAGE` is a page size, never a total): `queued` is the one claimable state no other sweep reaches, so a row this sweep stops short of stays accepted with no dispatcher and no reconciler, and one restart behind a large backlog would strand it permanently. Pinned by `test_taskq_runner_adapter.py::test_adopt_pages_past_its_scan_size_so_no_queued_row_is_stranded`, the only test in the suite a capped scan reds |
| `runner_admission_for(manager, cfg=, ladder=, coordinator=)` | the gateway's one-call factory over a `SubagentManager`: store getter `manager._taskq`, lane ceiling `manager.max_concurrent`, mode `agent.adaptive_concurrency_mode` (live), defer interval `agent.admit_wait_secs`. The store getter is LIVE and catches up on its own; `coordinator` is a plain field, which is why the late `attach_coordinator` below exists |

The boot reconciler deliberately keeps these kinds OUT of its adapter set: it
would settle a class-`unknown` run row as `unknown_side_effect` before the
runner could read `params.safe_retry` and resume from its checkpoint. It drops
the dead lease and stamps `awaiting_adapter`; `adopt_orphaned_rows` is the
adapter, run by `TaskRunner.attach_task_admission` (`taskrunner_step`) and
`WorkflowService.attach_task_admission` (`workflow_agent`, always settled --
a workflow run restarts through its own registry, never from one call's row).
Both arm the sweep only on the attach that already HAS a store, so the pass the
gateway makes before the store finished opening adopts nothing and the
store-ready pass adopts exactly once -- two concurrent sweeps over one set of
rows would let each settle a row the other is resuming.

Gateway wiring is TWO passes over ONE admission (`slack/gateway_runtime/admission.py`).
`_wire_runner_admission` runs while the dashboard socket is being bound, so both
consumers hold the admission -- and therefore the typed
`task_store_unavailable` refusal -- from the moment they can serve; it also
installs the lane's raise edge on the manager
(`SubagentManager.set_cap_raise_listener`, unconditional: the lane's ceiling is
the manager's cap whether or not a coordinator exists).
`_runner_admission_store_ready`, awaited from `run()` between
`wait_taskq_ready()` and the adaptive controller, is the second pass and is
IDEMPOTENT: it `attach_coordinator`s + `subscribe`s only when the first pass had
no coordinator, re-reads the rows with `rebuild()` right AFTER the attach (a
wait parked through the ledger between the coordinator's own build and the
handover is in neither schedule, and an attached coordinator stops `tick`
scanning the ledger), drops the `_runner_admission_tick` fallback, and re-runs
the adoption attach only if no pass has yet carried a store. A boot that never
lost the race passes straight through it. `agent.task_queue_enabled=false` (or a
store that never opens) keeps the fallback tick as the steady state.

Consumers: `taskrunner.md` § Durable task queue (run + step rows, adoption),
`workflows.md` § Agent execution adapters (`admitted_agent_fn`) and § Gateway
wiring (the ONE `RunnerAdmission` the gateway attaches to both, subscribed to
the manager's coordinator through `DependencyCoordinator.subscribe(on_wake=,
on_fail=)`). Row ids: `taskrunner:<run>` / `taskrunner:<run>:task<N>` /
`workflow:<run>:agent<N>`. `POST /api/tasks/{id}` (`answer_input` /
`cancel_wait`) is the operator's lever on a runner row's `waiting_input`, and it
is WAIT-only: a row whose runtime is live is refused there (409 `not_waiting`)
because ending a wait cannot stop an executor
(`learn-cron-dashboard.md` § Tasks & capacity). The handler's state test is a
PRE-CHECK; the refusal that matters is the store's `only_from=PARKED` under the
generation that read returned, so a row an admission takes live in between is
refused too and answers the same 409 (§ A cancel whose PRECONDITION came from an
earlier read). Pinned by `test/test_taskq_runner_adapter.py` and
`test/test_overload_integration_glue.py`.

### A descendant is never parked behind its own ancestor

ONE `RunnerLane` serves BOTH runner consumers. The gateway builds one
`RunnerAdmission` and attaches the same object to the TaskRunner and to the
workflow service, and a `RunnerAdmission` owns exactly one lane, so the two
draw from one counter (`lane=` on `admit` is the row's LABEL, not a second
gate). An admitted body holds its slot for its whole model turn. So a row that
descends from a row holding a slot, and asks for one on the same lane, is asking
for a release only its own ancestry can make — and `acquire` parks on a bare
future with no timeout, which makes that a permanent hang rather than a slow
path if the ancestor is waiting on the descendant.

The fence: `acquire(task_id, ancestors=)` raises `RunnerLaneSelfBlocked` (a
`RunnerAdmissionRefused`, so every caller that already reports a refused
admission reports this one) exactly when the lane is full, its bound is above
`0`, and EVERY holder is one of `ancestors`. `admit` supplies the ancestor set
from the row's `parent_id` chain — read on the writer thread, walked at most 16
deep, and only when the lane is already saturated — and ENDS the refused row
`cancelled` (`self-blocked on the lane`) so a kind with no dispatcher leaves
nothing `queued`. `pump` re-judges EVERY parked waiter on the saturated edge for
the same condition, which is what covers a waiter that parked legitimately and
became self-blocked afterwards because the bound FELL under it. Judging only the
head does not cover it: an ordinary root queued in front of a self-blocked
descendant is served only by the ancestor releasing, so a head-only scan leaves
both parked behind a head that is not itself refusable. Refusing a waiter cannot
disturb FIFO for the rest — it leaves the queue rather than overtaking — and the
scan runs only while the lane is at its bound. Pinned by
`test_taskq_runner_adapter.py::test_a_squeeze_refuses_a_self_blocked_waiter_that_is_not_the_head`,
which is the only test in the suite a head-only `pump` reds.

**The fence engages only where the store recorded the parentage, and that is not
yet the live nesting boundary.** `workflow_run` on a saved TASK-PLAN definition
does await nested admitted work on this lane — `start_definition` →
`task_runner.start_workflow_definition` → `execute_plan` → `_taskq_admit_step` →
`admit` — but the nested step descends from its own slotless `claim_only`
container row, not from the workflow agent row that is holding the slot, so the
ancestor set does not contain the holder and the wait parks instead of being
refused. What bounds it today is unrelated: `mcp_core._post`'s 30 s timeout, so
the symptom is a stalled tool call rather than a permanent hang. Closing it means
recording the launching row as the nested run's `parent_id` across the tool/HTTP
boundary; whoever adds that plumbing gets the fence for free, and whoever adds a
BLOCKING runner tool without it re-opens the unbounded shape.

What the fence deliberately does not do:

- **It never bounds a root's wait.** A root passes no ancestors, so however long
  the queue makes it wait it is served, never refused. A descendant with one
  unrelated holder is parked too: that holder's release is one the FIFO order
  hands on.
- **It does not carve a reserve.** `agent.child_reserve` exists on the SUBAGENT
  gate because that dispatcher picks out of a window and a depth-0 start could
  jump a queued child (`subagent.md` § Fairness lanes and the child reserve).
  This lane is strictly FIFO, so a descendant already queued cannot be
  overtaken, and a second copy of the reserve would buy nothing here.
- **It does not raise the ceiling.** A refusal takes no slot and a park takes
  one only on a grant, so peak holders still equal the effective cap.
- **It reads only the parentage the STORE holds.** A nested entry accepted with
  no `parent_id` is outside the fence; `reacquire_slot` (a row that already ran,
  taking its slot back after a yield) is deliberately outside it too, because
  refusing there would fail work in flight rather than decline to start it.

The sanctioned way to run nested work is the yield pair the dependency wait
already uses: the ancestor calls `Admitted.release_slot()`, the descendant is
admitted, and the ancestor `reacquire_slot()`s afterwards. `TaskRunner` follows
the same rule at a coarser grain — its run container row is claimed through
`claim_only` and holds NO slot, so its steps are descendants of a row that never
blocks them.

Pinned by `test_taskq_runner_adapter.py` (the lane refuses a wait only its own
ancestor could end; an ordinary waiter and a descendant with an unrelated holder
are both still served; a cap squeeze that leaves the head self-blocked refuses it
while the same squeeze on a root still parks; peak holders equal the effective
cap at caps 1-4 with three descendants and two roots contending; `admit` refuses
and ends the row on the store's own parentage; a descendant of the slotless
container row parks and runs) and `test_workflows_agent_pool.py` (a nested
`ctx.agent()` call is reported, not hung, and the same call runs once the
ancestor lets go).

**Every accepted row ends with an owner, a wait, or a terminal state.** The two
ways one could have neither, and what closes each: a caller cancel between
`accept` and the claim (closed inside `admit` / `yield_dependency`, above), and a
restart between them (closed by the adopter's `queued` sweep). Pinned per path —
`test_taskq_runner_adapter.py` (queued cancel, cancel after the grant, cancel
after the claim, a row another owner claimed, no-store, dependency-wait cancel;
a `starting` write a REAL locked database refuses — transient and for the whole
outage, plus `claim_only`'s — where the assertion is that the step body never
ran; adopt over accept-only + admit-only rows, twice, and the three rows it must
NOT touch: this incarnation's live `queued` row, a `retry_wait` row holding an
answer, any `subagent` row), `test_workflows_agent_pool.py` and
`test_taskrunner_taskq.py` (the same cancel and restart cases end to end through
`admitted_agent_fn` and `_execute_single_task`).

**Every store write whose result is DISCARDED, and why each one may be.** A grep
for `store.transition` cannot see this class: the write reaches the store as an
ARGUMENT (`await self._db(store.enter_wait, …)`, `await store.run(store.finish,
…)`, `_post_store_write(store, …, store.defer, …)`), so the enumeration is an AST
sweep over discarded-call statements, not a text search. A sweep matching only
`store.<method>` UNDER-reports it: the write is also handed over as a bound
`WaitLedger` method and as the bridge's own `taskq_advance`, so both spellings are
in scope below. **The sweep's SCOPE is the whole of `src/kiro_crew`, not the
packages that hold the store.** The first pass over `taskq/` and
`subagent_manager/` alone was itself a defect of this list: `execute_task`,
`_execute_single_task` and `admitted_agent_fn` are CONSUMERS of a handle, so they
carry the class without importing the store, and the consumer functions held more
of the sites that had to change than the store packages did. What had to change:
`waiting_input`'s `enter_wait` (above), `taskq_settle`'s `finish`
(§ posted vs inline), the stall recovery's `recovering_async` and its re-claimed
`running_async` (`task_executor`), and the `running` mark of a step
(`taskrunner._execute_single_task`) and of a workflow agent call
(`workflows.agent_pool.admitted_agent_fn`). The rest are safe for a reason that is
theirs, not the class's:

- `yield_slot`'s posted `enter_wait` (`admission/waits.py`) — the SUBAGENT sibling
  of the `waiting_input` site above, and safe where that one was not. The reason is
  already written at `_resume_publish`: a `running` row means the wait write was
  refused or is still behind this wake, and `running` is the state a granted resume
  wants anyway, so the grant publishes over it. The other half of that exemption is the one it
  does not need to name: a WAIT state cannot be reported back for the run's OWN
  wait. `wake_wait`'s default fence IS `model.WAITING`, so a resume grant carrying
  the generation the run holds — and neither `enter_wait` nor `update_wait` bumps
  it — lands on every one of the four wait states, `waiting_input` and
  `waiting_dependency` no differently from `waiting_children`. A wait state in
  `_resume_publish`'s refusal therefore always carries a STALE generation: the row
  was claimed again and a re-dispatch parked it in a wait of its own, which is why
  that refusal takes no retry. It cannot leave an unbounded
  `await` the way `waiting_input` did, because its wake is the admission resume
  grant and never `WaitLedger.wake` — the call that moves only a row the store
  already holds in a WAITING state.
- `taskq_defer_posted`'s `store.defer` (`admission/taskq_bridge.py`): the boolean
  is discarded because `_post_store_write` hands back the TASK, not the result, and
  a refused defer is the benign direction. `defer` only moves `next_run_at`, so a
  refusal leaves the row exactly as claimable as it already was and the pump refills
  it on its next pass — a retry one admission-wait early, never a lost or
  double-dispatched task. The result that must NOT be discarded here is the task
  itself, which is why it is kept in `_pending_defers` and awaited by
  `await_pending_defer` before the accept path lets the pump see the row.
- `execute_task`'s `consume_answer_async` (`task_executor`): a refused consume leaves
  the operator's answer replayable, which is the state a crash between the answer and
  the turn already leaves, and the row goes `done` so nothing re-asks it.
- the dependency coordinator's `_store_finish` on the terminal-signal arm and in
  `_fail_scope` (`taskq/dependency.py`): the coordinator clears its in-memory waiters
  and answers a terminal verdict either way. For a LIVE waiter the step's own handle
  writes the terminal state and `retry_terminal_writes` replays it; the case with no
  live owner is a row `rebuild()` restored, whose settlement the boot sweeps own.
- the pump's `resume_grant` (`admission/pump.py`), read after the queue entry was
  popped: the grant releases its own reservation on every refusal and the run stays
  parked, so a later `request_resume` is what moves it. Nothing proceeds as though the
  row resumed.
- `taskq_fail`'s posted `finish` (`admission/taskq_bridge.py`): a row refused before
  it registered, so `queued → failed` and `admitted → failed` are both edges and
  there is no generation to fence against. A refusal leaves a claimable row the
  sweeps settle, never work replayed.
- `taskq_mark`'s posted `taskq_advance`: best-effort BY CONTRACT — nothing awaits
  it, so it may not raise into the spawn path or the run loop — and a lost mark is
  recovered by `TaskStore.advance` replaying the missed step at the NEXT mark
  (§ The claim/start boundary, which also names the residual: a row that reaches no
  next mark).
- `taskq_settle`'s `_propagate` discarding the id list `taskq_cancel_children_of`
  returns: downward propagation AFTER the parent's own terminal write, so a child the
  cascade could not cancel keeps running and delivers its result to the parent session
  by id — the same disposition a `failed` or finished parent leaves its children in —
  and the next boot settles it. (`taskq_cancel_children_of` itself CONSUMES the
  ledger's answer inline, in `_cancel_children_db`.)
- `_cancel_live_or_row`'s posted `cancel_tree`, reached only from the `fail_parent`
  SIBLING cascade: the parent's own cancel is scheduled on the next statements
  regardless, so a sibling subtree the cascade could not reach keeps running and the
  next boot's reconcile settles it. Refusing here instead would leave the parent's
  cancel half-applied with nothing left to retry it.
- `accept_one` (subagent accept, `RunnerAdmission.accept`): the return is the id
  the caller already holds, and a failure RAISES.
- `accept`'s `restamp_accepted_by`: a database failure RAISES (into
  `RunnerAdmissionRefused`), so the discarded boolean is False only for a row that
  is GONE — and the `admit` this `accept` feeds then finds nothing to claim.
- `accept`'s `transition(…, RECOVERING, detail={"readopted": True})`: the
  `store.get` right after it is the answer, exactly as `_requeue_unstarted`'s
  `state_of` is, and a refused readopt hands back the row as it stands.
- `retry_terminal_writes`' `finish`: committed or fenced by a newer generation both
  mean the retry stops owning the write.
- `admit`'s `store.defer` under pressure: the loop keeps the row and re-checks, so
  a lost `next_run_at` costs one extra poll, never ownership.
- `_requeue_unstarted`'s `transition`: the `state_of` after it IS the answer.
- `_end_row_on_cancel`'s `finish` / `cancel` and `yield_dependency`'s
  `handle.cancel`: on an unwinding arm, where raising would REPLACE the
  `CancelledError` the caller must receive. `Admitted.settle` also keeps the write
  when the store is unavailable (`retry_terminal_writes` replays it), so False there
  means a newer generation already ended the row.
  (`cancel_wait`'s `cancel` is NOT in this list: its answer is the route's 200 vs
  409, and no wake is sent for a refused cancel — the wake ENDS a wait, so
  sending one would end a wait the call did not end.)
- the sweeps' `release_lease` / `finish` (`adopt_orphaned_rows`,
  `reconcile_on_boot`, and `open_default_store`'s `WaitLedger(store).rebuild()`): the
  report counts, and the next sweep re-examines the row.
- the dependency park's `advance`: `report`'s own `_enter` re-reads the state and
  PARKS when it is not `running`, so the mark's boolean is not the decision.
- the stop-recovery note's `record_progress`: deliberately not a state write.
- `taskq_child_registered`'s `update_wait` after the merged awaited set is
  published: reverting the publish on a refusal would make THIS incarnation wake
  one child EARLY, which is worse than a durable record one id short.
- `on_child_terminal`'s `fail_parent` `transition`: the outcome it returns cancels
  the parent, and `cancelled` is legal from every non-terminal state, so a refused
  `failed` is superseded rather than lost.
- `_taskq_begin_run`'s `running_async` on the RUN row (`taskrunner`), the one
  `running` mark in this tree that stays discarded: the run row never enters a
  WAITING state — the steps hold the waits — so every later write on it is a
  TERMINAL one, and `done` / `failed` / `cancelled` are legal from `starting`
  exactly as from `running`. Reconcile reads the two through one branch
  (§ Reconcile-first boot), so the row a lost mark leaves gets the verdict its
  side-effect class would have got anyway; a fence instead of an outage means
  another owner ended the row, and `_taskq_end_run`'s terminal write is refused
  for that same reason. This is the reason the STEP and workflow-agent marks do
  NOT share: those rows do enter waits.
- every terminal `done_async` / `fail_async` / `cancel_async` and the synchronous
  `fail` / `cancel` in `taskrunner`, `workflows.agent_pool` and `task_executor`'s
  callers: the `Admitted.settle` contract above is the whole reason — the write is
  KEPT when the store is unavailable (`retry_terminal_writes` replays it until it
  commits or is fenced), so a False is either that retry taking ownership or a
  newer generation having already ended the row, and there is nothing a caller
  could do with it that the row does not already say.
- `Admitted.reclaim`: not a discarded boolean at all. It returns True or raises
  (`RunnerTaskCancelled` for a row that ended while it waited,
  `RunnerAdmissionRefused` from `admit`), and `execute_task`'s stall arm handles
  both in band rather than letting them unwind the run.

## Configuration

### Reverting to pre-queue behaviour

These three flags bound the rollback story for the default-on scheduling change.
`agent.adaptive_concurrency` and `agent.adaptive_concurrency_mode` apply live.
`agent.task_queue_enabled` is read when the manager opens its store: changing it
normally requires a gateway restart; while a failed-open retry is already armed,
disabling it is observed by the next retry. Setting it false restores the in-memory
`_queue` dispatch (`tasks.db` stays in place, unread). Setting
`agent.adaptive_concurrency=false` stops the controller moving any cap;
`agent.adaptive_concurrency_mode="fixed"` pins both actuators as plain semaphores
(the execution cap at its ceiling, `max_subagents` or `subagent_auto_max`, the
daemon's spawn gate at `mcp_gateway.spawn_concurrency_initial`).

**What the three flags do NOT restore.** An operator who sets all three does not
get pre-queue behaviour, because these are new bounds and new results that no
flag reverts:

- The gatewayd spawn gate still bounds concurrent backend spawns at
  `mcp_gateway.spawn_concurrency_initial` (4 by default). Before this change a
  private/exclusive backend was bounded by nothing, so this is a NEW ceiling that
  the fixed mode pins rather than removes. `mcp_gateway.spawn_concurrency_max`
  (raised to the subagent ceiling when that is higher) bounds how far the
  controller raises it; nothing returns it to unbounded.
- `agent.session_start_concurrency` bounds concurrent `session/new` calls, and
  `agent.interactive_command_policy` decides what happens to a tool call that is
  waiting on a human at a terminal. Both are new, both are outside the set above,
  and each has its own key.
- `spawn_sub_agents` no longer reports a wait expiry as `timed_out`; it returns
  `still_running` with per-agent state. That change is UNCONDITIONAL -- a caller
  parsing the old value sees the new one with the queue disabled.
- The recovery ladder (`recovery/`) and the daemon's host budget
  (`mcp_gateway/host_budget.py`) have no off switch: each REPLACES the code it
  supersedes (the per-layer ad-hoc retry loops; the unbounded per-key fork), so
  there is no earlier path to switch back to -- the RFC's rule for such a change
  is "reversal: none by flag; a different design is a new RFC" (§13).

| Key | Default | Live? | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agent.task_queue_enabled` | `true` | restart* | `false` keeps the in-memory queue for one release; `tasks.db` stays in place, unread |
| `agent.task_dispatch_window` | `64` (1..4096) | restart | bound on in-memory queued entries |
| `agent.task_store_journal_mode` | `auto` (`auto` \| `wal` \| `delete`) | restart | SQLite journal for `tasks.db`: `auto` = WAL only on a volume DETECTED local, DELETE on a detected network filesystem AND on an undecidable one (WAL's shared memory is what SMB/NFS lacks, so unknown takes the slower correct mode); the other two force one and skip detection. Unknown values read as `auto` |
| `agent.admit_wait_secs` | `30` (1..3600) | restart | admitted → queued after this; also the deferral re-check interval |
| `agent.start_collect_timeout_secs` | `300` (10..3600) | restart | reserved for the session-start gate's start collector |
| `agent.dependency_max_attempts` | `20` (1..1000) | restart | coordinated probes a scope gets before its waiters fail |
| `agent.dependency_wait_deadline_secs` | `3600` (0..86400) | restart | wall-clock ceiling on one dependency wait; 0 = attempts cap only |
| `agent.dependency_wake_per_tick` | `0` (0..4096) | restart | waiters released per wake tick after the probe; 0 = current effective admission capacity |
| `agent.dependency_wake_spacing_secs` | `1.0` (0..60) | restart | pause between staged wake ticks |
| `agent.lane_weights` | `{}` (values 1..64) | yes | per-lane weights keyed by root session key or `system`; unlisted lanes weigh 1 |
| `agent.child_reserve` | `1` (0..8) | yes | slots a depth-0 start may never take while a nested row or a resume waits for a slot; also lifts an adaptive squeeze to `adaptive_floor + child_reserve` while a parent waits (never above `max_subagents`) |

`restart*`: a manager whose durable-store open has failed re-reads the setting on
its scheduled retry, so disabling the queue can take effect there without another
restart. An attached store is not detached live, and enabling a storeless manager
has no retry driver; those changes require restart. Dependency coordinator values
are snapshotted when its one process-wide instance is first built (normally during
startup), so later edits require restart. Fairness settings (`lane_weights`,
`child_reserve`) are re-read through the manager's two-second cache.

## Invariants (pinned by tests)

- `test_taskq_state_machine.py`: 15 states, every edge in one table, terminals have no exits (except `unknown_side_effect→done|failed`), cancel from every non-terminal state, record round-trip; `steps_to` over every state pair — each step an edge `check_transition` accepts, no identity, no terminal intermediate; and the DIRECTION it refuses: `running→queued` / `running→admitted` / `starting→queued` answer nothing although two legal edges join each, the surviving two-step set is exactly `admitted → starting → {running, recovering, retry_wait}`, and `admitted→recovering` stays available because that is the mark a `session/new` timeout writes before any stream event.
- `test_subagent_dependency_mark.py`: the dependency park against a row whose `starting` write was lost — the whole park lands (`admitted→starting→running→waiting_dependency`, a real wait record, zero `rejected_transition`), the next boot asks the side-effect class instead of requeueing blind, a cancel in the claim window still fences the replay as `stale_result`, and both marks reach ONE store method (`TaskStore.advance`); on `journal_mode=delete` with a competing writer every read is `TaskStoreUnavailable` and `taskq_mark` stays a debug-level best effort rather than raising into the spawn path; a refused terminal write on a parked row is logged with the row's real state.
- `test_taskq_store.py`: `apply_schema` is one shape at `SCHEMA_VERSION` (fresh file has `wait_json`, `lane`, both indexes) and a second apply changes nothing; a newer-stamped file is refused; ids only after commit; an injected write failure raises `TaskStoreUnavailable` and commits nothing (not even the batch's first row); duplicate id / idempotency key refuse; locked past busy timeout refuses rather than hangs; network FS → `delete` journal + warning; defer keeps `queued` but ineligible; a conditional `cancel` refuses a row that left `only_from` (`rejected_transition`, and the row's own owner still settles it) and one whose generation moved although the state is still acceptable (`stale_result`, and the same call under the row's real generation cancels), while the unconditional form still ends `starting` and `running`.
- `test_taskq_claim_fencing.py`: two real threads on separate connections, 40 rows → each row won exactly once; stale generation `finish` is a no-op with a `stale_result` event; terminal never regresses; duplicate completion no-op; cancel before/after claim and during run all end `cancelled`.
- `test_taskq_reconcile.py`: crash at queued / admitted / running / result-written-not-acked → nothing lost, terminals kept, `admitted→queued`, class-driven recovery, cancelled never revives, idempotent; legacy import fields and idempotency.
- `test_taskq_admission_integration.py` + `test_subagent_scale.py::TestDurableQueueScale`: real admission + fake worker; 2000 submissions → 2000 rows before any id returned, window ≤ 64 throughout, 2000 unique `done`, depth 0; FIFO across the window boundary; store-only cancel never starts; a queued row the drain CLAIMED and started inside `taskq_cancel_queued`'s own read is not cancelled under the spawn (the caller falls through to the live reap); restart with a fresh manager re-dispatches queued rows; `task_queue_enabled=false` leaves no `tasks/` directory.
- `test_overload_integration_glue.py` (the route's own cancel pins, real store + real `RunnerAdmission` + the real handler): `cancel_wait` over every state in `STATES` — each `PARKED` one cancels, each `EXECUTING` one is 409 `not_waiting`, each terminal one is 409 `terminal`, and the three sets are asserted to partition `STATES`; and the RACE — the handler's row read held open while a real `admit` claims that row and takes it `running`, after which the cancel is refused (409 `not_waiting`, row `running`) and the live worker's own `done` still commits with no `stale_result` event.
- `test_fairness_lanes.py`: `lane_key_for` mapping; smooth WRR is round-robin at equal weights, spreads a weight-3 lane, ties go to the oldest head, FIFO inside a lane; accept derives root / `system` / inherited lanes and never guesses an orphan's; `fetch_dispatchable_fair` interleaves lanes (and is FIFO with one lane), `children_only` and `pending_lanes`; on the real manager: 200 rows from one session, one row from another and one cron root at cap 1 → the small lane and `system` each start within three grants while the big lane stays FIFO; `lane_weights` 3:1 gives 6:2 of eight grants; `lane_weights["system"]=2` gives 4:2 of six; the child reserve on a three-level tree at cap 2 (children and resumes take the last slot, roots wait, roots fill the cap again once nothing nested is pending); a waiting parent whose child runs reserves nothing; `child_reserve=0` disables the rule; an adaptive cap of 1 is lifted to 2 for the child while a parent waits, roots still see 1, and the lift ends with the wait; no lift for a non-adaptive cap; the lift never exceeds `max_subagents`; settings clamp; no checkpoint-pause flag exists (RFC Q3); `wait_resume_granted` is immediate for a run holding its slot, times out for a yielded one, and is released by the grant event (one event per wait); `GET /api/spawn/{id}/resume` reports, holds and releases on the grant; the MCP hold re-asks after each held request, releases on `granted`, on `known=False`, on an error payload and for a chat-turn parent, and names `resume_pending` only after it observed an ungranted slot at the deadline; `spawn_sub_agents` holds until the second answer says granted and still returns the children's results.
- `test_taskq_waits.py`: each wait kind's record fields and round-trip; `model_text` alone refused; entry keeps the generation and the lease, is fenced, and refuses wait→wait; wake bumps the generation, clears the record and fences old callbacks; park ends residency into `retry_wait` re-claimable at `next_run_at`; cancel semantics per kind (tree children-first with done siblings untouched); deadline → `failed{wait_deadline}`; `signal` wakes one scope only.
- `test_taskq_nested_propagation.py` (real admission, fake worker): 3-level tree holds zero slots while unrelated work completes; one slot + waiting parents still progresses to completion; wake on the LAST child (`child_settled` events); two waking parents re-admitted one at a time; `continue` vs `fail_parent`; parent cancel cascades to live and store-only children; wait deadline fails the parent; restart preserves links, revives nothing, cancels the orphaned queued grandchild; `rebuild` wakes a parent whose children finished; a `spawn_run` (non-blocking) parent keeps its slot; yield/resume idempotent and generation-fenced.
- `test_dependency_signals.py`: each adapter maps its real error shapes (GitHub 403 rate limit + `X-RateLimit-Reset`, 429 + `Retry-After` delay and HTTP-date, GraphQL `RATE_LIMITED`, `gh` stderr; generic 429/503 with host scope; Bedrock throttle / usage limit / auth / model-unavailable via `AcpError`); `Retry-After` and `X-RateLimit-Reset` become an exact `retry_at`; auth and parameter errors are terminal whatever the adapter said; pre-attached signals win; a raising adapter is skipped; the monitors' `_classify_cli_error` answers exactly what the shared parser does.
- `test_dependency_coordinator.py`: five tasks on one scope → one schedule, one probe at `retry_at`, and a probe failure costs the scope ONE attempt — one per wake WAVE however wide the ramp, while a newcomer arriving mid-wave spends none of the probe budget (`dependency_max_attempts` counts probe cycles, not arrivals) and a woken waiter's failure still spends one and still exhausts the scope; two scopes: one throttled, the other's waiter completes; staged wake = probe, then capacity-sized batches per spacing, never all at once; a server `retry_at` is honoured exactly and only extends, and an unexpired one floors the backoff a headerless probe or ramp failure would otherwise shorten (the published `shared_retry_at` included), with expiry and `recovered` as its only exits, so a scope keeps its attempts for after the stated reset instead of failing its waiters early; jitter stays in `[ceiling/2, ceiling]`, where `ceiling = min(cap, base·2^(n−1))`; attempts cap and wall-clock deadline fail every waiter with the reason; `auth_failed` → `waiting_input`, `permanent_param_error` → `failed`, neither scheduled; a fresh coordinator's `rebuild()` restores the schedule, its waiters and the server floor from the rows and events, so a restart mid-throttle keeps the stated reset (a row written without the floor key restores no floor, and a restored floor still expires into the ladder); a `starting` row parks in `retry_wait` with `next_run_at` = the scope deadline and wakes to `queued`, and the verdict names that state rather than the live one; a wake the store could not WRITE keeps the waiter on its scope with no wake event and nothing reported woken, while a wake the store REFUSED drops it (also with no event); a wait that persisted NOWHERE answers `unpersisted` — no `dependency_wait` event, nothing for `rebuild()` to find, and no waiter left on the schedule; a give-up reached through `report()` on the writer thread runs its hooks ON the loop their `asyncio.Event`s belong to; and no store write of any kind is made with the schedule lock held.
- `test_taskq_startup.py`: the open is off-loop and every spawn is refused typed until it attaches; a failed open keeps that refusal immediately after startup; a TRANSIENT failure (`database is locked`) is re-attempted and the store then attaches, `taskq_accept` going from the refusal reason to a committed row; the reaper sweep is what asks; the delay is `RecoveryPolicy`'s equal-jitter step over `agent.recovery_backoff_*`, nothing is armed before its deadline, and a re-open never un-attaches an open store.
- `test_task_executor_stall_recovery.py` (real store + real `RunnerAdmission` +
  real `RecoveryLadder`, the executor driven end to end): a stall the ladder
  approved after two ordinary failures re-runs the turn instead of failing the
  step, and the ladder's L3 count records exactly one failure for it; a stall
  once per L3 cooldown — which the ladder approves for ever, its count having
  decayed — is bounded by `STOP_RECOVERY_MAX_RETRIES` instead; a `recovering`
  write a REAL locked database refuses ends the step with its partial and leaves
  the row `running` under this incarnation's generation (so the caller's terminal
  write still commits) rather than re-claiming a row the store never moved; and a
  cancel that lands during the backoff ends the STEP, not the run, with the
  cancel intact on the row.
