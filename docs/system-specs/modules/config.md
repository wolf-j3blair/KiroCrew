# Config Module

## Overview

Foreign-agent onboarding is gated independently by `dashboard.import_onboarded`,
migrated from the older `dashboard.onboarded`, and the settings it projects are
merged strictly (merge-only, never a wholesale replace). The loader preserves legacy
numeric strings and integral floats already present in a config file, while rejecting
booleans and non-integral, malformed, or non-finite values. Imported settings are
type-validated before they are written, and the CLI converts typed values before
writing.

The config package loads runtime configuration from `~/.kiro/crew/config.json`
using stdlib dataclasses with sensible defaults. `config/sections.py` and
`config/loader.py` are the two facades callers import. Each composes the owner
modules below and re-exports their names as the same objects, so an existing
`config.loader.X` or `config.sections.X` import keeps resolving.

A patch reaches the code that looks the name up in the patched module, and only
that code. Names read by code that stays in `loader.py` are call-time seams on
the loader: `config_path`, `config_dir`, `config_local_path`, `env_path`,
`workspace_root`, `_default_workspace_base`, `write_config_atomically`,
`update_config_locked`, `atomic_write`, `_config_write_lock`,
`_config_fingerprint`, `_validate_config_data`, `_persist_config_migration`,
`_apply_document_migrations`, `_log_config_clamp_event`,
`_DEFAULT_CHAT_TURN_TIMEOUT_SECS`, `DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE`, `unsandboxed_exec_declared`,
`publish_config_timezone`, `record_adoptions` (the loader passes it to the
migration transform at call time), each `_build_*` name as `_load_resolved`
calls it, and the published-snapshot globals. A helper or constant read INSIDE a
relocated builder or migration rule is patched on the module that reads it:
`config.section_builders` for the value coercers, the STT, computer-use and
instance bounds, `coerce_runtime_ceiling` (which reads the monitoring bounds in
`monitoring.limits`), the `_resolve_stub_*` roster
readers and the section DTO classes a builder constructs; `config.migration` for
`auto_adoptable`, `drop_drifted_keys`, `stored_value_or_none`,
`superseded_default_drift` and `drift_summary`. The loader facade and
`config.migration` hold the same warn-once set `_REPORTED_SUPERSEDED_KEYS`: clear
it with `.clear()`, never rebind it. `test_config_refactor_contract.py` pins
representative seams of each kind.

| Owner | Owns |
|---|---|
| `config/fields.py` | `_meta` field metadata and the `_safe_*` value coercers every section shares. A leaf: it imports nothing from `kiro_crew`. |
| `config/sections.py` | The DTOs other specs and tests anchor here: agent, crew record, workspace, session, dashboard (with `TailscaleConfig` and its parser), the messaging channels, `wakatime`, speech-to-text and its degradation rules, telemetry, decisions, resource limits, and the bounds constants. It is also the facade for the three section owners below. |
| `config/memory_sections.py` | `memory`, `knowledge`, `skills`, `session_summary` and the named `memory_stores` records. |
| `config/integration_sections.py` | `mcp`, `mcp_gateway` (with the MCP stub roster readers the gateway seed shares), `instances`, `tunnel`, `publish`, `computer_use` and the external app `registries`. |
| `config/service_sections.py` | `taskrunner`, `messaging`, `cron_history`, `monitoring`, `heartbeat` and `watchdog`. |
| `config/section_builders.py` | The `_build_*` helper of 28 sections, grouped by the module that owns each section's DTO. Four `_build_*` helpers stay in the loader (agent, session, telemetry, dashboard). Sections with no helper are built inline in `KiroCrewConfig._load_resolved` (`heartbeat`, the external app `registries`, `memory_stores`, the `agents` crew roster, `workspaces`) or by their DTO (`DecisionsConfig.from_raw`, `ResourceLimitsConfig.from_raw`, `ChannelConfig.from_dict` for `slack_channels`). |
| `config/migration.py` | The write-back migration ids, the document transform `apply_document_migrations`, the one-shot `connections_ui` marker name, the legacy `skills.lazy_load` cohort test, superseded-default reporting, and the in-memory half of an adoption. |
| `config/resolution.py` | Raw overlay merging, top-level section classification, and degraded-input tracking. |
| `config/validation.py`, `config/schema.py` | Schema validation with the validated-data cache, and the JSON schema and restart registry built from the DTOs. |
| `config/paths.py`, `config/live.py`, `config/superseded_defaults.py` | Pure path primitives, the one live-config watcher and applier registry, and the superseded-default registry with its acknowledgment ledger. |
| `config/loader.py` | `KiroCrewConfig` (load, serialize, save, model and provider resolution) and the residual core below. |

Imports run one way: `fields`, then the three section owners, then `sections`,
then `section_builders` and `migration`, then `loader`. Each module imports only
modules earlier in that order plus the existing leaves (`sections` imports
`resolution`, `migration` imports `superseded_defaults`, and neither leaf imports
back), and none of the owners imports `loader`, `schema` or `validation`;
`test_config_module_boundaries.py` pins the graph. Every module
split out of the loader logs as `kiro_crew.config.loader`, so a relocated warning
keeps the record name operators filter on.

`sections.py` keeps its DTOs because other specs name the file for them:
[messaging](messaging.md) (the channel restart flags), [slack-gateway](slack-gateway.md),
[crew-mode](crew-mode.md), [history](history.md), [stt-streaming](stt-streaming.md),
[metrics](metrics.md), [decisions](decisions.md), [security](security.md),
[model-selection](../common/model-selection.md), [model-fallback](model-fallback.md),
[subagent](subagent.md), [acp-client](acp-client.md) and
[crew-log-projection](crew-log-projection.md). Four source scans also allow a construct
only in that file: `ResourceLimitsConfig.from_raw`, `_tailscale_config_from`, the
`_AVATAR_MOTIONS` literal and the `AgentConfig.acp_backend` declaration.

`loader.py` groups each residual responsibility into one bannered section. Each
stays in that file because something outside this package names the file, or
because its readers look up a name the loader's callers and tests patch there:

| Kept in `loader.py` | Held there by |
|---|---|
| Credential keys, the `.env` reader, the dashboard port | [code-style](../common/code-style.md) names `config/loader.py` for `CRED_*` and `_DEFAULT_PORT`. |
| Data-home and workspace path helpers | Tests and callers patch `config_path`, `config_dir`, `env_path`, `workspace_root` and `_default_workspace_base` on this module. The instance-pairing and redactor-registry scans key `read_local_secret` and `credential_redaction_path` to this file. |
| The unsandboxed-exec platform policy | [security](security.md) places that resolution in the loader, where the raw document is read. `unsandboxed_exec_declared` reads the patched `config_path`/`config_local_path` and is itself patched on this module. |
| Document I/O: `_raw_config`, `read_config_for_update`, `write_config_atomically`, `update_config_locked`, the meta stamp | The config-writer scans in `test_config_rmw_preserves_settings.py` exempt only `loader.py`, and the writers read this module's patched path and `atomic_write` names. |
| Write-back persistence (`_persist_config_migration`, the backup) and the `_apply_document_migrations` seam | It rewrites `config.json` under the same writer exemption, and passes this module's `record_adoptions` to the transform as the adoption-ledger writer. |
| The validated-document cache fingerprint, its overlay sidecar and invalidation | `_config_fingerprint` reads the patched `config_path`/`config_local_path` and is itself patched on this module; `save()` and the write-back call `_invalidate_config_cache` beside it. |
| `KiroCrewConfig.load`, `_load_resolved` and `save` | They read `config_path`, `config_local_path`, `_config_fingerprint`, `_validate_config_data`, `_persist_config_migration` and `write_config_atomically` by name, all patched on this module. `test_config_section_construction.py` pins `_load_resolved`'s assembly shape. |
| The security clamp and its SEL event | [security](security.md), [sel](sel.md) and [resource-protection](../../architecture/resource-protection.md) name the loader. |
| The loop-stall and managed-launch readers | `load_loop_stall_exit_after` reads the loader's patchable `KiroCrewConfig`; `resolve_loop_stall_exit_after` and `consume_managed_service_launch_environment` are its two halves, and the dashboard server imports all three from here. The consume takes the marker out of `os.environ` so descendants do not inherit it, and hands it to `platform_compat.keep_for_reexec`, so the gateway's own exec successor (an in-app restart) is still a managed launch; `launched_as_managed_service` answers from either place, so it does not change once the dashboard has started. |
| The agent, session, telemetry and dashboard builders | The harness-parity review scope and a source check on the `session_control` read; the patchable `DEFAULT_POOL_SIZE` fallback; [metrics](metrics.md) naming the loader as the telemetry parser; the feature map naming the loader's `folder_sort` read. |
| Published snapshots: materialized agents, the alias table, the compaction threshold, the timezone | Tests rebind this module's snapshot state, and the second-boot witness in `test/integration/test_boot_smoke.py` keys the counters to `kiro_crew.config.loader`. |
| Agent resolution and the provider factory | [crew-mode](crew-mode.md) and [context-management](../../architecture/context-management.md) name the loader for `resolve_agent_bindings` and `resolve_effective_model`. The agent-spec read inventory keys its call sites to this file, the ACP import is a baselined agent-SDK edge, and the blocking harness-parity and memory-store review rules cover `config/loader.py`. |

New section constants, including local speech's automatic-language default, are
read from `config.sections` directly; they do not expand that historical facade.

New work goes to the owner of its responsibility, not to a facade: a field to
the module that owns its section's DTO, a new section's DTO to
`memory_sections.py`, `integration_sections.py` or `service_sections.py` by
domain, a shared coercer to `config/fields.py`, a section's `_build_*` helper to
`config/section_builders.py`, a migration rule to `config/migration.py`, and
overlay, validation, schema, live-applier and path work to its owner in the
table above. `config/loader.py` takes only work inside one of its residual rows,
and `sections.py` gains a new DTO only when another spec anchors it there.

A feature whose section spends tokens on the user's behalf defaults to off and
documents its knobs in its own spec — `session_summary` is the current example
(see [session-summary.md](session-summary.md)), following the shape
`SkillsConfig` established: every field carries `_meta` label/help for the config
surfaces, out-of-range values are clamped with a warning rather than raising, and
a malformed section degrades to defaults so a hand-edited file cannot prevent the
gateway from starting.

`dashboard.dynamic_dashboard_cards` follows the same cost rule: default false,
hot-applied through the live watcher, with a native control on Dynamic Dashboard
surfaces. It enables event-driven per-session HTML cards without enabling
`session_summary`. Runtime status and native decisions remain available when it
is off. Route and watcher registration do not import or construct the optional
producer. Both server entrypoints activate it in the deferred post-listen watcher
task when enabled, or on the first live enable; later toggles reuse that instance
and its charged budgets. Fixed call, byte, cache and iframe limits and the disable/cancellation
contract are documented in
[learn-cron-dashboard](learn-cron-dashboard.md#automatic-session-status-cards).

## Orchestration prompt contract

`config/prompt.md` guides direct work and delegation using a concrete-value
policy. Parent-plus-child parallelism depends on the spawn receipt's delivery
capability. Runtime checks and compatibility are
owned by [subagent.md](subagent.md), not inferred from prompt wording.

## Embedding rebuild request publication

`memory.embed_rebuild_generation` is an explicit-apply request identity, not a
model label or a completion counter. Model apply commits it with the validated
model settings before invalidating vectors. Managed vector publications hold the
same config sidecar lock while checking that request and committing their SQLite
write. They cannot publish an old result after a newly committed request, even
when the store has not yet been reconciled. Store-local signatures and handled
requests remain checked inside SQLite write admission. Conditional model rollback
preserves the request and unrelated edits, and refuses a competing model/request
change. An untouched upgrade retains the empty request default.

This field is install-local runtime obligation state even though it is published
atomically in the model-settings transaction in `config.json`. It is not a
portable preference or a completed-work flag. Back up and restore the model
settings, this request, and memory databases together. Copying a non-empty request
to a different installation intentionally invalidates stores that have not
acknowledged that request, including aligned ones; do not distribute it in a
fleet configuration template. Clearing/resetting it while keeping existing
memory databases loses the outstanding same-label rebuild obligation. The
ordinary model-space signature check remains, but cannot replace that lost
request. Such a reset is not a supported way to cancel or complete rebuilding:
after a reset or mismatched restore, explicitly apply the intended model again
(`Rebuild memory vectors` for an unchanged path) before relying on vector search.
That publishes a fresh obligation for open and later-opened stores. This design
accepts config/state coupling to retain one atomic publication point; it does
not claim to recover obligations that an operator deletes out of band.

Managed vector publication resolves a symlinked config through `_lock_target`,
exactly as the config writer does, before taking its sidecar lock. Within a
store operation the order is config sidecar, the store's process-local lock,
then SQLite write admission. A writer waiting for the config sidecar therefore
holds no database lock that could stall a concurrent reader. Both locks remain
held through vector validation, commit or rollback. Model apply releases its config mutation before
aligning stores; it never holds that sidecar while waiting for a store lock.
Native inference runs before those publication locks. Store close releases its
SQLite and lifetime handles without saving a vector index or acquiring config
admission again, including when rollback failure closes an uncertain connection.

## Data Home Location

Kiro Crew's data root nests **under kiro-cli's own `~/.kiro/` base** so all
Kiro-family apps share a single directory a user can secure. `config_dir()`
(in `kiro_crew/config/paths.py`, re-exported from `kiro_crew/config/loader.py`)
is the single accessor and resolves to:

1. `$KIROCREW_HOME` when set (used as-is; refuses system directories like `/`,
   `/usr`, `/System`, `/etc`), else
2. `~/.kiro/crew` (the default).

**No migration — net-new users only.** All supported installs start directly in
`~/.kiro/crew`; there is no `~/.kirocrew` to relocate, so `config_dir()` simply
resolves and `mkdir`s the home above. The one-time `~/.kirocrew` → `~/.kiro/crew`
data-home migration that earlier releases carried has been **removed** (see
`docs/system-specs/post-launch-removals.md`). A leftover top-level `~/.kirocrew`
from an old install is never read, migrated, or deleted; it is left in place —
still credential-gated by the `.kirocrew` security-path spelling — and `kirocrew
doctor` reports it, warning rather than advising deletion when it still holds a
virtual environment (`venv`/`.venv`/`venvs`), since that may be the running
interpreter.

**Repository-controlled uninstall contract.** Every uninstall path owned by this
repository preserves the Kiro Crew data home by default. `kirocrew service
uninstall` removes only its service definition; the Python/npm packages define
no uninstall lifecycle hook; and the desktop shell's generated NSIS uninstaller
removes only installed program state: its install directory, shortcuts,
channel-scoped updater cache, and any legacy “start with Windows” registry entry
(`deleteAppDataOnUninstall` stays false), without
resolving or removing the Kiro Crew home. App Kit uninstall also preserves the
app's `data/` subtree unless the dedicated `purge_data=true` API action (CLI
`--purge-data`, or an explicit dashboard choice) is supplied. The API checks
for the literal boolean `true`; absent, legacy, or malformed values fail closed
to preservation. A whole-home purge is never coupled to uninstall.

**Uninstaller consideration (external dependency).** Because the data home now
lives under `~/.kiro/`, a hypothetical Kiro-family uninstaller that removes
`~/.kiro/` would also remove `~/.kiro/crew` and take Kiro Crew's data — config,
credentials, memory DB, session history, and the SEL audit chain — with it. This
is a persisted-data one-way door, and — unlike when an archived rollback copy
existed — there is now no `~/.kirocrew.archived` fallback for ANY install
(upgrader or fresh), so such a wipe is unrecoverable total data loss.

Any Kiro-family uninstaller spec **MUST** either explicitly exclude
`~/.kiro/crew` from a `~/.kiro/`-wide wipe, or prompt before deleting it.
Independently, a user who wants the data home entirely outside `~/.kiro/` can set
`KIROCREW_HOME` to relocate it.

**Technical hedge — recovery-pointer breadcrumb.** `config_dir()` writes a small,
non-secret `~/.kirocrew.breadcrumb` pointer file at the top-level home
(`RECOVERY_BREADCRUMB_NAME`), deliberately **outside** `~/.kiro/`, recording the
data-home path (see `_write_recovery_breadcrumb`). It is idempotent where the
platform can check safely (on POSIX the prior content is read via `O_NOFOLLOW`
and rewritten only when the recorded path changes; where that flag is missing —
Windows — the check is skipped and the file is atomically rewritten once per
process), best-effort (never blocks startup), and
written only on the default path (a `KIROCREW_HOME` override carries no `~/.kiro/`
wipe risk). It is **not a backup** — just a durable signpost that survives a
`~/.kiro/`-wide uninstaller wipe so a user or support script can find any
surviving data or understand what was removed. This narrows, but does not
eliminate, the one-way-door risk above; the release gate still stands.

**Paths are resolved per call, never captured at import.** Because
`config_dir()` re-reads `$KIROCREW_HOME` on every call and resolution/maintenance
is deliberately lazy, the resolved value is only correct at the moment it is
needed. Modules therefore MUST NOT bind a path factory result to a module-level
constant:

```python
_SOME_DIR = config_dir() / "some"        # WRONG -- frozen at import
```

An import-time binding captures whatever home was active when the module was
first imported, which breaks two things at once: pod isolation (a pod exports
its own `KIROCREW_HOME`) and test isolation — `conftest.py`'s autouse `_isolate_kirocrew_home`
fixture runs *after* collection has already imported the module under test, so
it cannot reach a frozen constant. That last hole let a local test run write
2128 fixture rows into an operator's real usage store.

The required shape keeps the module-level name as an explicit opt-in override
(`None` = resolve live), so existing `monkeypatch.setattr(mod, "_SOME_DIR", tmp)`
call sites keep working:

```python
_SOME_DIR: Path | None = None

def _some_dir() -> Path:
    return _SOME_DIR if _SOME_DIR is not None else config_dir() / "some"
```

Annotating the override as `Path | None` is load-bearing: any consumer that
still reads the constant directly becomes a **mypy error** rather than a silent
`None` at runtime. This is enforced repo-wide by
`test/test_lazy_data_home_paths.py`, which walks the AST of `src/kiro_crew` for
module-level assignments calling any factory declared in `config/paths.py` and
fails on every hit. The factory list is derived from `paths.py` itself, so a
newly added factory is covered without editing the test. Issue #874.

**`config_dir()` maintains; `data_home()` only resolves.** `config_dir()` is
*resolve + maintain*: besides resolving the home it `mkdir`s it and refreshes the
recovery breadcrumb (a stat + a read). That work belongs to process start —
`ensure_data_home()` is the startup hook — and the distinction did not matter
while callers froze the result in a module constant, because the maintenance
then ran exactly once, at import.

Resolving per call makes it load-bearing: a request handler would otherwise
refresh the breadcrumb **on the event loop** as a side effect of asking where a
directory is. So the accessors above call **`data_home()`**:

| branch | behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| a **valid** `KIROCREW_HOME` override | delegates to `config_dir()` every call, so an override set *after* import is honoured. That branch performs no breadcrumb refresh — only a cheap `mkdir`. |
| default home already resolved | returns the cached `_resolved_home` directly — no `mkdir`, no breadcrumb. |
| not yet resolved | delegates to `config_dir()`, so the **first** resolution in a process creates the home and refreshes the breadcrumb once. |

The first row tests `_valid_override_home()` — the **same predicate `config_dir()`
gates on**, not merely "is the env var set". An override naming a system
directory (`/`, `/usr`, …) is rejected there and resolution falls through to the
default home, so gating on the raw env var would send every call down the
maintenance path for anyone with a bad override. The two predicates must not
drift apart; a regression test pins both directions.

`data_home()` keeps no cache of its own — the override branch must stay live, and
the cached branch reads the same `_resolved_home` that `config_dir()` populates,
so there is one source of truth for the location.

Existing direct `config_dir()` callers are unchanged and keep the maintenance
behaviour, including 25 pre-existing calls that already sit inside async
handlers.

## Workspace Root

`workspace_root()` returns the base directory for all LLM working directories (kiro-cli cwd, task runner output, etc.):

Resolution order:
1. `KIROCREW_WORKSPACE` env var — no `kirocrew-workspace` subdirectory appended
2. Saved path in `~/.kiro/crew/workspace_dir` (written by `kirocrew setup`; re-running setup preserves the existing value as the prompt default)
3. Platform default:

| Platform | Path |
|----------|------|
| macOS | `/Volumes/workplace/kirocrew-workspace` (falls back to `~/workplace/kirocrew-workspace` if `/Volumes/workplace` doesn't exist) |
| Linux | `~/workplace/kirocrew-workspace` |
| Windows | `~/workplace/kirocrew-workspace` |

Values from (1) and (2) lose one surrounding quote pair and have `~` expanded; a non-absolute result is logged and replaced by (3).

Each session/task gets an isolated subdirectory under this root via `_session_work_dir(key)`:
- Chat sessions: `kirocrew-workspace/cli_chat`, `kirocrew-workspace/{thread_ts}`
- Background: `kirocrew-workspace/_bg`
- Cron: `kirocrew-workspace/cron_{job_id}`
- TaskRunner: `kirocrew-workspace/taskrunner_main`

The selected root is created on first call and realpath-normalized before session
subdirectories are derived.

## Project Directory Resolution

`KIROCREW_PROJECT_DIR` env var controls where agent config and skills are loaded from:

1. Env var `KIROCREW_PROJECT_DIR` (if set and valid)
2. CWD walk-up — CLI walks up from CWD looking for `skills/` + `src/kiro_crew/` (the `agents/` dir was removed in commit bbbc1f6e when agent config moved into `src/kiro_crew/config/`)
3. Saved path in `~/.kiro/crew/project_dir` (written by `kirocrew setup`)
4. Bundled fallback — `config/defaults.json` and `builtin_skills/` inside the package

The CLI (`cli.py:main()`) auto-detects and sets the env var at startup.

## Folder steering directories (`dashboard/chat_folders.py`)

A chat folder record in `folders.json` may carry an optional `steering_dirs`
list of absolute (or `~`-prefixed) directories, alongside its existing
`project_dir`/`default_agent`/`color`/`tags`. Every chat in the folder's subtree
loads each directory's `**/*.md` as steering, in addition to global and project
steering. The key is omitted when empty (like `color`/`tags`), so "absent means
none" is the single on-disk representation and a PATCH with `[]` clears it.

- **Validation** (`_validate_steering_dirs`) reuses the `_validate_project_dir`
  contract per entry — absolute or `~`-prefixed, `expanduser` + `realpath`,
  `is_sensitive_path()` rejection (SEL-logged), and must be an existing
  directory — plus a `MAX_FOLDER_STEERING_DIRS` (16) list cap and rejection of
  duplicates within one folder (compared by resolved realpath). Failures return
  `400` with code `steering_dirs_invalid`.
- **Principal gate** (`_refuse_principal_steering_dirs`) runs at both write
  sites BEFORE validation touches any path: only the person may declare a
  non-empty list. A `POST`/`PATCH` carrying one from an app or crew-member
  principal is refused `403` with code `steering_dirs_forbidden` and SEL-logged
  as denied, because folder permission is not host-file permission -- the
  gateway reads these files unsandboxed on the folder's behalf, and an app that
  could point its own folder at an arbitrary readable Markdown tree would have
  that read laundered into its own model session with no tool grant and no
  signal. Clearing to `[]` stays allowed for every principal (it only removes
  reads). The person may still declare steering on a folder an app or member
  owns; delivery then routes it to that principal's chats as described below.
- **Resolution** (`_resolve_folder_steering_dirs`) is ACCUMULATIVE up the
  `parent_id` chain (root ancestor first, then descendants), unlike the
  nearest-wins `project_dir` resolver: an org-standards folder above a per-repo
  folder contributes both sets. The walk is cycle-guarded, re-validates each
  stored path (never trusting `folders.json`, which can list a directory since
  moved or made sensitive), and dedups by resolved realpath keeping the first
  occurrence.
- **Live resolution, no slot field.** The effective list is never cached on the
  chat slot: `_ChatSlot` carries no steering field, and neither slot create nor
  agent switch resolves one. The dashboard turn path
  (`dashboard/chat_runner.py`) resolves it live from the slot's current
  `folder_id` against the committed folder tree, on every fresh session and
  every post-compaction reinjection turn. So editing a folder's `steering_dirs`
  reaches the chats already filed in it at their next fresh session, with no
  cache to invalidate; a slot with no `folder_id` contributes nothing. A
  resolver error logs a warning naming the slot and the turn proceeds with no
  folder steering, and a directory that has since disappeared is skipped at read
  time rather than failing the turn. Delivery is performed once by the context
  builder (`kiro_crew.context.ContextBuilder`) reading through
  `kiro_crew.folder_steering` — the one layer every backend passes through, so
  no provider can silently drop it. See [providers](providers.md).

## Named Memory Stores (`memory_stores.py`)

The reserved `agents.default` assistant uses the existing Global Memory **V1**.
Explicit creation of a new Crew Member allocates one **V2** memory store.
Automatic discovery and existing V1 members retain their V1 bindings. Changing
`default_agent` selects the member with its existing memory version and binding;
it never converts member memory to Global. A materialized provider template which
is not a Crew Member continues to use V1.

### Separate files preserve V1

| Resolver | Global `default` | Member V2 store |
|---|---|---|
| `memory_store_dir_for` | `<home>/workspace/` | `<home>/memory_stores/<name>/` |
| `resolve_store_path` | `<home>/memory.db` | `<home>/memory_stores/<name>/memory.db` |
| `memory_index_path_for` | `<home>/memory_index.db` | `<home>/memory_stores/<name>/memory.db` |

V1 retains its markdown, history and separate index layout. Explicit V2 creation
adds only manual `memory/preferences.md` and `memory/projects.md` beside its
single SQLite database; learned history and search use that database. No path is
renamed and no V1 data is migrated, copied or algorithmically converted on member
creation. Member stores begin empty. Explicit selected-content inheritance and
its provenance are owned by [memory-skills-hooks](memory-skills-hooks.md).

### Member identity and creation

A V2 member has an immutable persisted `member_id`, independent of its editable
config/display label. `MemoryStoreConfig.owner_member_id` and the database's
`member_database` singleton record identify the same owner and store ID.
`memory_version: 2` selects V2; legacy declarations default to V1. `owner_member`
is descriptive display metadata, never execution authority. Templates and
projects cannot select a member's memory.

The template-picker roster withholds `member_id`; the full configuration view
applies the same credential and exfiltration redaction to this hand-editable
string as other member fields. Stored identity values remain unchanged.

`provision_member_memory(config, member)` allocates an exclusive random directory
and creates a new SQLite database through `create_member_database`, plus the
explicit manual preferences/projects documents. The member/config binding is
published only after initialization succeeds. It never adopts an existing
unidentified database, resets a store, or copies earlier V1/V2 data. An existing
V2 member must retain its ID and store. No manifest, retirement registry, private
payload copy, OS admission gate, or memory provisioning feature flag is involved.

`POST /api/agents` and `kirocrew agent create` allocate new stores automatically.
A supplied named store is rejected. Owner edits may echo the current store but
cannot silently rebind it. Legacy members keep their explicit Global or named V1
binding. Member updates and automatic discovery never initialize a V2 database;
only explicit creation of a new member may allocate one. Existing V1 memory
and transcripts remain unchanged.

`persist_member_config` publishes the member and store under `update_config_locked`,
rechecking duplicate creation, immutable member ID, expected binding, and exclusive
store ownership while preserving unrelated concurrent edits. When creation fails
or is cancelled after allocating a store, the creation paths call
`retire_unpublished_allocation`: it re-reads `config.json` under the same lock and
removes the fresh directory only when no member and no store entry references it,
then restores the in-memory binding so a retry allocates fresh. A publication that
landed is kept; pre-existing bindings and stores are never deleted or retired.
Degraded or unreadable configuration refuses creation instead of guessing defaults.
Non-string `member_id` or `owner_member_id` values refuse allocation with
`UnknownMemoryStore` before forming the reserved-ID set, preserving the raw values,
existing databases and V1 bindings instead of replacing damaged identities.

A `memory_version: 2` record whose `owner_member_id` is empty is a member store
written before identities existed; the loader keeps it verbatim and every
resolver refuses it. `repair_legacy_member_stores()` runs in the `cli.main`
prologue after `boot_platform` for every CLI subcommand except `gateway`,
`doctor` and the `mcp-*` servers, and for the gateway in its post-readiness
memory preparation worker (never on the boot path), so both
surfaces publish the missing `member_id` / `owner_member_id` pair before any
member is resolved. It writes through `update_config_locked`, skips a config
whose memory section degraded, and never raises. Criteria, refusals and the
database half are owned by
[memory-skills-hooks](memory-skills-hooks.md#pre-identity-member-stores-are-upgraded-at-start).

### Exact resolution and explicit failures

Admission resolves one frozen `ExecutionContext` containing member ID, store ID,
selection namespace, template, app attribution, and privacy mode. The snapshot is
part of the owning session/run/job record, captured before awaiting asynchronous
work. Background workers, continuations, schedules and reruns inherit it directly;
closing the originating chat or editing a display name does not retarget execution.
An explicit `target_member` selects an existing configured member under ordinary
execution permissions. There is no automatic provisioning or fallback to Global.

`resolve_declared_store` and `require_member_memory_store` reject malformed,
missing and contradictory declarations. `resolve_agent_bindings(...,
validate_memory_files=False)` captures configuration identity without opening
learned memory. Persona/project/manual context can therefore load while the
learned database is unavailable. Actual memory operations validate the captured
store's database identity with `open_member_database`; an absent, corrupt or wrong
member database is an explicit error and is never recreated at read time.

Store names use lowercase letters, digits and hyphens, 1–80 characters, with no
leading/trailing hyphen, path separators or Windows device basename. Managed paths
must remain under `memory_stores/` and may not redirect to another store.
`memory_store_version` reads the exact configured declaration; it does not infer
ownership from labels, paths or database contents. V1 opens refuse a database
bearing the explicit V2 identity table rather than treating it as Global memory.

Incognito and Temporary modes are inherited monotonically. New restricted sessions
keep their canonical record in memory and suppress Crew body/checkpoint writes.
Tightening an existing persisted execution updates only retention metadata so a
restart cannot broaden it. Ordinary transport authentication, app/owner permissions,
enterprise governance, host sandbox and credential protection remain independent
of memory routing. Same-host arbitrary-code confidentiality between member stores
is not a goal. See [memory-skills-hooks](memory-skills-hooks.md) and
[security](security.md) for the storage and ordinary host-security contracts.

## Workspace fall-through is logged

`workspace_dir_for(name)` also reads the LOADED config's `workspaces` table rather
than the raw bytes, so it and `resolve_agent_bindings` cannot answer the same
question two ways. An unmapped name falls back to `default_workspace` and then to
`WorkspaceConfig().dir`, and the fall-through is logged: two DISTINCT names both
resolving to `<home>/workspace` warns, because that is how a workspace split becomes
a shared tree nobody notices. An install that simply has no `workspaces` section is
the ordinary fresh state and logs at debug. It **never raises** —
`default_project_dir` and the workspace-identity block are built on it, so a raise
would break a fresh install and take both with it.

Consequence worth knowing: a legacy FLAT `{"name": "dir"}` workspaces entry is a
type mismatch the schema validator removes before the loader sees it, so such an
entry is absent from the loaded table. `resolve_agent_bindings` has always answered
from that table; `workspace_dir_for` now agrees with it.

## Superseded Defaults (reported; a named few adopt themselves once)

`config.json` is a full materialization of the schema -- every field is written to
disk, including fields the operator never set -- and each field is resolved as
`data.get(key, DEFAULT)`. A stored value therefore always beats the dataclass
default, so **changing a shipped default reaches only installs created after the
change**; a pre-existing install keeps whatever value was materialized last.

`config/superseded_defaults.py` holds an append-only registry
(`SUPERSEDED_DEFAULTS`) of default changes existing installs should be told about,
each entry naming the dotted key, the old default, the new default, and the
release that changed it. `superseded_default_drift(base_data)` returns the entries
whose stored value equals the old default, comparing type as well as value so a
stored `0` is not read as `False`.

Every registered row is listed once, in the table under *Auto-adoption* below,
with its change and the reason it adopts or only reports. **Three** carry
`auto_adopt` -- the agent timeout budgets and the spawn memory floor -- and every
other row is report-only.
`test_the_spec_table_lists_every_registered_row` keeps that table equal to the
registry.

A row may also carry a `note`: one sentence that `doctor`,
`kirocrew config defaults` and the `--keep` confirmation append to it. It exists
when choosing between `--adopt` and `--keep` needs a fact the old and new values
do not carry. `skills.lazy_load`'s says what `false` means now (below).
`decisions.history_budget_chars` says adopting is bounded by the consented history
ceiling. The two tool-stall windows say they are coupled (see the table).

A row marked `meaning_moved` also puts its note on the one-line load-path
warning. That mark is for a stored value whose MEANING moved along with the
default, and `skills.lazy_load` is the one such row. On 0.6.0 and earlier
`false` was the default full skills dump, and today it selects the shorter entry
naming only the eight hottest skills. A 0.6.0 install may hold a materialized
`false`, and an operator who chose `false` there chose the full dump. The row
stays report-only because `false` is also the supported switch to the short
entry. Its note says what `false` means now, on every surface, so keeping it is
never mistaken for keeping the 0.6.0 behaviour, and `--adopt` takes the index.

A row may also carry `applies`, a predicate that says where the old and new
defaults behave differently; elsewhere the row is not drift. `stt.language_code`
uses it: only the local recogniser auto-detects, and every other provider
resolves `"auto"` to `en-US`, so a stored `en-US` there already behaves like the
default and is not reported. The row's own value is still detected on the base
document alone, but the predicate reads the EFFECTIVE `stt.provider`, with
`config.local.json` merged over the base, because the recogniser that runs is the
effective one.

The subagent turn budget follows 1000 automatically when its key is absent,
including in an existing installation after an update. Every valid stored value
is retained, even 100: a materialized old default and an explicitly selected
100-turn cap are indistinguishable without historical per-key provenance.
The defaults report exposes the change and the existing adopt/keep commands;
it does not claim that ambiguous legacy files can be upgraded without risking
an operator's deliberate cap. The three-hour execution timeout remains separate.

### Auto-adoption, and the line it does not cross

Reporting is the right answer only while the two readings of a stored value are
indistinguishable AND holding the old value is survivable. On the two agent timeout
budgets neither holds: an install carrying `agent.subagent_timeout_secs: 1800` reaps
every subagent at 30 minutes on a build whose default is 10800, and its operator
sees timeouts instead of results having never chosen 1800. Nor on the spawn
memory floor: a materialized `agent.spawn_min_memory_gb: 4.0` keeps 4 GB free after
every start, which a 16 GB laptop rarely has, so its subagents wait in the queue
and essentially never start. The existing mechanism's
only answer was a CLI command they have no reason to know exists.

So `SupersededDefault.auto_adopt` opts ONE entry into a one-shot rewrite. What keeps
the set small is **not** a judgment about how wide the value's range is. That
criterion was tried and is wrong: `instances.warm_set_cap` is numeric with a range,
and an operator running five crews who types 5 stores exactly the old default. The
line that holds is whether the old value is something an operator sets on purpose.
For four rows another suite pins it as a supported configuration, and the table
names that test; every other report-only row gives its plain reason:

| Key | Change | | Pinned by, or why |
|---|---|---|---|
| `agent.subagent_timeout_secs` | 1800 -> 10800, #8891 | adopts | -- |
| `agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs` | 7200 -> 14400, #8949 | adopts | -- |
| `agent.spawn_min_memory_gb` | 4.0 -> 2.0, #15890 | adopts | -- (the 4.0 inputs in the admission tests set a floor, they do not pin a stored 4.0 as supported; the opt-out is `0`, not the old default) |
| `session.autocompact_pct` | 90.0 -> 70.0, #4388 | reports | `test_a_persisted_ceiling_value_is_left_alone` |
| `dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs` | 25 -> unset, #6651 | reports | `test_explicit_desktop_default_is_preserved_for_managed_service` |
| `stt.streaming` | false -> true, 0.5.0 | reports | `test_put_persists_streaming` |
| `mcp_gateway.forward_declared_env` | false -> true, #4566 | reports | `test_a_real_false_still_turns_it_off` |
| `stt.model` | "turbo" -> "base", 0.5.0 | reports | a picker value; adopting changes transcription accuracy |
| `instances.warm_set_cap` | 5 -> 0, #7248 | reports | 5 is an ordinary deliberate cap |
| `agent.subagent_max_turns` | 100 -> 1000, #12203 | reports | an explicitly stored 100 is a supported cost/turn cap |
| `agent.session_control` | false -> true, #8375 | reports | false is the supported global withdrawal of peer-session tools |
| `skills.lazy_load` | false -> true, #12131 | reports | false is the supported switch to the short skill entry; its `note` reaches the load line too (`meaning_moved`, above) |
| `agent.subagent_spawn_stagger_secs` | 2.0 -> 0.25, #12203 | reports | the knob to raise when the host or provider is the bottleneck |
| `session.watchdog_rss_max_mb` | 1536 -> 0, #16393 | reports | 1536 is an ordinary deliberate ceiling; holding it only recycles idle sessions, which keep their history |
| `stt.language_code` | "en-US" -> "auto", #9246 | reports | a locale picked on purpose; adopting changes what the recogniser listens for. Only where the effective provider, overlay included, is local (`applies`): elsewhere "auto" resolves to en-US |
| `decisions.history_budget_chars` | 0 -> 2000, #12928 | reports | 0 is a supported setting below the consented history ceiling; adopting raises it only up to that ceiling (carries a `note`) |
| `watchdog.stale_window_secs` | 300.0 -> 600.0, #8949 | reports | a tuning knob; holding it probes a live think sooner, which regenerates it |
| `watchdog.tool_stall_suspect_secs` | 3600.0 -> 5400.0, #8949 | reports | a tuning knob; holding it cancels a tool the oracle cannot attest after an hour, with no re-run, so that tool's work is lost. Coupled with the hard cap (`note`): the window is the smaller of the two, so both must be adopted to get 5400 |
| `watchdog.tool_stall_hard_cap_secs` | 3600.0 -> 7200.0, #8949 | reports | a tuning knob; holding it caps the same forbearance at an hour, with the same cost. Coupled with the suspect window (`note`): adopting either one alone leaves the window at an hour |
| `watchdog.model_silent_probe_secs` | 900.0 -> 1800.0, #8949 | reports | a tuning knob; holding it probes a long silent think sooner, which regenerates it |

A row whose old value is a supported configuration is not stale noise, whatever
its type. `test_only_unpinned_broken_budgets_adopt_themselves` pins both sets by
name -- the rows that adopt, and the rows that only report -- so a new row has to
be placed in one of them on purpose, and moving a row across edits that test in
the same change. `auto_adopt` defaults to False, so a new row is report-only until
someone states otherwise.

Two further properties make the rewrite safe on the rows that remain, without the
per-key provenance the config layer still lacks:

- **One-shot.** `auto_adoptable()` excludes any key already in the sidecar's
  `adopted` map, so a key is adopted at most once per install and a value the
  operator sets back afterwards is theirs forever. Without that record the loader
  would re-remove a restored value on every load -- the one behaviour worse than
  saying nothing.
- **Marker first, chosen for its worst case.** `record_adoptions` writes the ledger
  entry BEFORE the removal, inside the config write lock, and a failing record aborts
  the whole migration write. `config.json` and the sidecar are two files with no
  shared transaction, so exactly one of two windows exists and the ordering decides
  which one:

  | Ordering | Window | Consequence |
  |---|---|---|
  | marker first (this) | durable marker, failed removal | the operator KEEPS their value and the adoption is not retried. A **missed improvement**, recoverable with `kirocrew config defaults --adopt` and still named by the startup line. |
  | removal first | landed removal, lost marker | nothing suppresses a later adoption, so a value the operator deliberately RESTORES is deleted a second time. A **destroyed choice**, unrecoverable. |

  No retry, rollback, compensating write or two-phase pending/committed scheme removes
  the window -- each only moves it onto another write that can fail the same way, and
  a rollback that fails recreates the hazard it exists to prevent. So the marker goes
  first and the failure lands on the recoverable side.
  `test_a_failed_write_keeps_the_value_and_does_not_re_adopt_later` pins that path
  end to end, including that a later load does not take the value on a retry, and
  `test_the_unapplied_adoption_is_still_reported_so_it_is_recoverable` pins that the
  marker suppresses the retry but not the report.
- **An adoption that did not reach disk drops the validated-data cache.** Only a load
  that READS the base document can decide an adoption (`adoptable` is empty on a cache
  hit, by design), so a read-and-skip that left its document cached would have every
  later load serve the stale value and never retry. A contended lock and an exception
  caught by the best-effort handler both skip the write, so `_load_resolved` tracks
  `adoption_landed` separately from `persisted` (which starts True so the
  `connections_ui` marker still lands on a load that needed no migration) and
  invalidates in a `finally` both share. Both variables are bound before the `try`,
  or an early exception would turn a logged write-back failure into a `NameError`
  out of `load()`. The **degraded-sections branch is deliberately excluded**: its
  retry condition is "the operator fixes the file and restarts the gateway" (a
  degradation observation is sticky for the life of a process), not "the next
  load", so an invalidation there would only re-read and re-parse `config.json` on
  every load for as long as a malformed section coexists with a stored stale
  timeout. After the restart the fixed file's fingerprint misses the cache and the
  adoption retries on that first load
  (`test_a_degraded_load_keeps_its_document_cached_instead_of_re_reading_forever`).
- **An unreadable ledger adopts nothing.** `_read_ack_document_status` returns
  `(document, readable)`, and `auto_adoptable` returns `[]` when a sidecar exists but
  cannot be parsed: reading it as empty would re-arm the one-shot over a value the
  operator restored. The ACK half stays fail-soft, because a missed ack costs one
  report line rather than a deleted setting.

`record_adoptions` takes the sidecar lock **single-shot** (`wait_for_lock=False`),
because the config load path runs on the asyncio event-loop thread in places and a
blocking acquire there stalls the gateway for as long as another writer holds it. A
contended acquire raises `BlockingIOError`, which the migration treats as "defer to
the next load" -- the same deferral `_persist_config_migration` already takes on a
contended config lock. A CLI caller keeps the wait: no loop to stall, no later retry.

`--keep` still wins: an acknowledged value is not drift, so affirming a key before
it is adopted keeps it, which is the answer for an operator who did choose 1800.

Adoption is an **un-materialization**, not a write of the new number:
`drop_drifted_keys` removes the stored key, so the field resolves through
`data.get(key, DEFAULT)`. That holds only until the next FULL rewrite of
`config.json` -- any settings save re-materializes the current number, as
`drop_drifted_keys`' own docstring says -- so a later default move on the same key
still needs its own registry row and does not ride along.

It is applied in memory as well, because the gateway reads these budgets once at
startup -- a disk-only fix would leave the run that performed it still holding the
old value, which is exactly the "upgraded and nothing changed" complaint. Two guards
on that half: `_adopt_in_memory` reads the field's OWN dataclass default rather than
the row's `new_default` (on a key whose default moved twice, the matching row's
`new_default` is an intermediate value), and it replaces the value only when the
parsed field still EQUALS `old_default`, so a value the loader clamped or coerced
keeps the loader's correction. A key the `config.local.json` overlay supplies is
cleared on disk but left alone in memory: the overlay is the operator's live choice.

After the config write succeeds, the loader warns at the default log level for each
adopted key, naming the removed value and the `kirocrew config set` command that
restores it. A deferred or failed write emits no adoption notice. The warning
describes the stored value without claiming to know whether the operator chose it.

That warning is one line in one gateway log, so the same two facts are replayed on
demand: `kirocrew doctor`'s `Stored Defaults` section and a bare `kirocrew config
defaults` both render the sidecar's `adopted` map through `adoption_summary` -- one
`adopted:` line per key, naming the value removed from `config.json` and the exact
restore command -- and both render it BEFORE opening `config.json`, so a missing or
unreadable config does not hide what an earlier load removed from it. The line says
"removed from `config.json`", not "the default now applies", because
`config.local.json` may still carry the key; and it allows for the marker-first
window (an entry whose config write failed describes a value that is still stored
and still listed as drift). Both fields come from the sidecar, a file the agent
sandbox can write, so they are untrusted output: every character is rendered
terminal-safe (control characters escaped, never executed), and the pasteable
restore command is built only from `SUPERSEDED_DEFAULTS` literals after matching the
entry by key and exact value -- no quoting scheme is portable across every shell an
operator might paste into, so an entry the registry does not vouch for is shown,
escaped, with no command. An adopted key holds no stored value any more, so it is
neither drift nor an `--adopt`/`--keep` target; naming one there is refused like any
other non-drifted key.

**Downgrade residual.** A build older than the adoption ledger serializes the
sidecar as `{"acked": ...}` only. Running that build's `--keep` or `--adopt` after a
downgrade therefore rewrites the file WITHOUT the `adopted` map, which re-arms the
one-shot: on the next upgrade a value the operator restored to the old default is
adopted a second time. Current builds carry both maps through every write
(`_update_map`) and refuse to rewrite a sidecar they cannot parse, so the window
exists only across that specific downgrade-then-write sequence, and the second
adoption still announces itself at WARNING with the restore command.

`stt.provider` is deliberately absent from `SUPERSEDED_DEFAULTS` even though its
default moved to `local`: `_validated_stt_provider` coerces a retired value at
parse time, so the stored value never wins and there is no *default* for an
operator to adopt. It is instead a **coerced value**, tracked separately in
`COERCED_VALUES` — see below.

Both sides of an entry are **history**, so both are literals: a later change to
the same key APPENDS a new entry rather than editing an existing one, which keeps
the older row a true record of the change it describes. What must stay current is
the END of each key's chain --
`test_every_registered_key_ends_at_the_live_default` asserts the newest entry per
key names the default the loader actually applies, so moving a default without
appending a row fails rather than leaving the report telling operators to adopt a
value that no longer exists.

Two surfaces render it. Neither writes config; the load path's adoption above is
the only thing that does, and a key it adopts is excluded from the warning rather
than pointing the operator at a command for something already fixed:

- The load path emits **one** warning naming every drifted key plus the command to
  resolve it, evaluated on the **stored base document before the
  `config.local.json` merge** -- an overlay value is the operator's live choice and
  says nothing about what the base materialized, so a base drift is still reported
  when an overlay masks it, and an overlay-only value is not reported at all. One
  line rather than one per key: the registry is append-only, so a per-key line
  grows without bound on exactly the long-lived installs with the most real drift,
  and it lands on every short-lived `kirocrew` invocation, where the
  once-per-process guard buys nothing because there the process IS the invocation.
  The per-key text is still emitted at debug, so `-vv` keeps it in the log. The one
  per-key text the line does carry is the note of a `meaning_moved` row, because
  that stored value now selects a different behaviour from the one its operator
  chose, and the line is what someone who never opens `config defaults` reads
  before running `--keep`.
- `kirocrew doctor` prints a `Stored Defaults` section reading `config.json`
  directly. Drift is informational and does NOT become an issue; an unreadable or
  malformed config does.

### The legacy `skills.lazy_load` rewrite

0.6.x and earlier materialized `skills.lazy_load: false` into every `config.json`
they saved, and `false` was then the default full skills listing. Since 0.7.0
`false` selects the short skill entry and the default is `true`, so an upgraded
install silently runs the narrowest mode. This is NOT an `auto_adopt` row: on a
0.7+ install `false` is the supported switch to the short entry, so value equality
cannot tell noise from a choice. What can is WHEN the value was written, the same
boundary the `connections_ui` launch migration uses.

`migration.legacy_lazy_load_rewrite_due` decides on the BASE document, on a load
that read it (never on a cache hit). It returns the writer's stamp only when all of
these hold; every other case leaves the value exactly as stored:

- the base stores exactly the boolean `false` (an explicit `true`, `0` or a string
  is never touched);
- `meta.lastTouchedVersion` parses as `major.minor.patch` with at most a short
  suffix and names 0.6.x or older. An absent, non-object or unparsable `meta` is an
  unknown writer, not a provable one, and declines;
- `connections_ui_migrated.json` does not exist. It first shipped in
  0.7.0-insider.1 and every clean later load writes it, so its absence proves no
  0.7 build has loaded this home;
- the adoption ledger is readable and does not name the key. This keeps the rewrite
  one-shot even if the marker is later deleted; an unreadable ledger declines.

**What stays unmigrated.** Nothing reports a declined `false` until the registry
carries a report-only row for the key; the loader already skips that key in the
same load's superseded-default line when it is the one being removed. The marker
predates the meaning change: 0.7.0-insider.1 to insider.5 wrote it while `false`
still meant the full listing, so an install that ran one of those keeps its
materialized `false`. That is the conservative side of the boundary: the proof
cannot tell those installs from a 0.7 operator who chose the short entry.

The stamp is the proof, so nothing may re-stamp the document before the rewrite
uses it. The load decides before it writes, and `refresh_config_meta_stamp` (the
gateway's post-bind refresh) holds its refresh while the rewrite is still due, so a
degraded first load leaves the proof for the next clean one. A writer that runs
before any load and re-stamps -- `kirocrew config set --file`, which replaces the
whole document with the operator's own -- ends the cohort, which is correct for a
document the operator just supplied. So does any other real write by this build
during a degraded session (a settings save, `config set`): those writes are this
build's bytes, and holding the stamp across them would let the rewrite undo a value
set on this build, which the in-lock re-check exists to prevent.

The rewrite then rides `MIGRATE_SKILLS_LAZY_LOAD` through the same write-back as an
adoption: re-detected inside the config write lock (still an exact `false`, still
stamped 0.6.x or older; `kirocrew config set` and every settings save re-stamp, so
a value set since the load's read is never undone), recorded in the adoption
ledger as `{"skills.lazy_load": false}` BEFORE the key is removed, in the SAME
record as any superseded-default adoption of that pass (two records would let a
failed second one strand the first as adopted with nothing removed), the key
un-materialized rather than written as `true`, the in-memory value moved only once
the write is confirmed and only where `config.local.json` does not supply the key,
the validated-data cache dropped when the write did not land, and the
`connections_ui` marker deferred with it. One WARNING per rewrite names the key, the
writer's version, why, which value now applies (the default, or the overlay's when
`config.local.json` sets the key), and the `kirocrew config set skills.lazy_load
false` that chooses the short entry. The `skills.lazy_load` registry row has the
ledger entry's key and old value (`superseded_defaults.LEGACY_LAZY_LOAD_ADOPTION`),
so `adoption_summary` vouches for it and `doctor` and `kirocrew config defaults`
replay it with a restore command (a bool spelled as JSON); the marker-first
residual leaves a stored value that row still lists as drift. A load that declines
on an unreadable ledger or stamp still writes the marker, so that install keeps its
value for good; a degraded or deferred load writes neither and the next clean load
decides again.
`test_config_lazy_load_legacy_migration.py` pins the truth table.

## Acknowledging a superseded default

Value equality alone cannot falsify a report, so before #7559 an operator who
deliberately chose a value equal to a superseded default was told about it on every
load forever, with no way to answer -- and that unanswerable line competed for
attention with the genuine drift on the same install.

`kirocrew config defaults` is the surface that resolves the ambiguity the load path
must not resolve for anyone:

- no flag lists each drifted key with its stored value, the current default, and
  the release that changed it, marking anything already affirmed;
- `--adopt [KEY...]` REMOVES the stored keys, so `data.get(key, DEFAULT)` resolves
  the current default from the next load and the next full rewrite materializes it.
  Rewriting is safe here where it is not on the load path because the operator
  asked by name, and only a key whose stored value IS the superseded default is
  ever removed. Detection runs again inside the write lock, so a value changed
  since it was listed is left alone. It prints each key it removed, and asks for
  a gateway restart only for the keys `requires_restart` marks, the schema's one
  statement of which fields a running gateway cannot adopt (see *`restart=True` is
  the single source of restart truth*). That makes a row whose consumer reads its
  key only at boot a row that must carry the mark:
  `dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs` does, because the gateway sizes its
  loop-stall watchdog from it once at start;
- `--keep [KEY...]` records the stored values as intentional, which suppresses the
  load-path line for exactly those values. A kept row that carries a `note`
  prints it again in the confirmation.

An acknowledgment records `<dotted key> -> the acked VALUE`, not the key alone, so
it covers the choice rather than the key: change the value later and the report
returns. Acks live in `~/.kiro/crew/superseded_acked.json` (`{"acked": {...}}`),
**not** in `config.json` -- a `to_dict()` rewrite carries only schema fields, so
the same materialization behaviour this whole mechanism reports on would silently
drop an ack stored in the config document. Three properties of that file matter:

- **Reads cannot block indefinitely.** The read runs on the config-load path, which
  is an event-loop path, and the file sits at a path the agent can name -- where
  `open()` on a FIFO waits for a writer forever and would wedge the gateway rather
  than merely delay it. `_read_ack_document` therefore `lstat`s and refuses anything
  that is not a REGULAR file (links included) or is over `ACK_MAX_BYTES` (64 KiB),
  opens with `O_NONBLOCK | O_NOFOLLOW` where the platform has them so a leaf swapped
  after the `lstat` fails instead of waiting, re-checks the OPENED object with
  `fstat`, then finishes with one capped `os.read`.
- **Every refusal fails soft.** Missing, non-regular, oversized, unreadable,
  malformed, not an object, a non-string key: an ack suppresses one line and changes
  no runtime behaviour, so the worst consequence of ignoring a broken file is being
  told again. That soft read is also why the file carries no schema version -- any
  shape it cannot understand is already handled, so the field would have no reader.
- **Writes never RESOLVE the leaf.** The config writers deliberately FOLLOW a link,
  because symlinking `config.json` into a dotfiles repo is a supported setup; here
  that would let a link planted at this path redirect the write onto an arbitrary
  file. `_update_acked` refuses a link it can see AND writes through `atomic_write`,
  which renames a fresh temp file OVER the leaf -- so a link swapped in after the
  check is replaced rather than followed. The check reports the condition; the rename
  is what makes it unexploitable.
- **Every mutation is a locked read-modify-write.** `_update_acked` holds the ack
  file's own lock across read, merge and write, so two concurrent `--keep` calls
  cannot both read the same map and have the second replacement drop the first
  operator's acknowledgment.
- **`record_acks` re-reads the config under its lock**, rather than trusting the
  caller's snapshot, and re-checks that each key is still drifted. A value changed
  between the listing and the call would otherwise be acknowledged at its superseded
  snapshot, which then suppresses the report for a value the operator never affirmed.
  The ack write happens inside that same config lock hold; lock order is
  config-then-ack at the only site that nests them.

`--adopt` also drops the ack for a key it removed, since the acked value is no
longer stored and keeping it would silence a genuinely deliberate choice made
later. When `config.local.json` also carries an adopted key the report says the
overlay still overrides it, because the EFFECTIVE value did not change. Every
filesystem refusal on these paths surfaces as a controlled non-zero CLI error,
never a traceback.

`doctor` LISTS an acknowledged entry rather than hiding it: an ack answers the
unsolicited load-path line, while `doctor` answers "what does this install still
hold?", and hiding an affirmed value would make that answer wrong.

## Coerced values (removable, never affirmable)

`COERCED_VALUES` in the same module tracks a second, distinct kind: a stored value
the loader **replaces** at parse time rather than merely overriding. The difference
decides what an operator may do about it. A superseded default still wins, so it
may be a deliberate choice and must not be rewritten. A coerced value cannot win,
so there is nothing to preserve — which makes removing it unambiguously safe and
makes affirming it meaningless, and `--keep` refuses it by name rather than
promising a setting that never takes effect. Left in place it is inert bytes that
cost a warning on every load, forever, because a load never writes.

One entry today: `stt.provider`. Its retired values (`whisper`, `mlx`, `parakeet`,
`faster`) degrade to `local`; any other unknown value degrades to `off`, so a
value nobody can account for never selects the in-process native recogniser
(kirodotdev/KiroCrew#13179). Because the two resolutions differ, `resolves_to` is
a callable of the stored value (delegating to `_validated_stt_provider`, the
loader's own rule) and the entry carries the section `default`. `--adopt` uses
both: it REWRITES a coerced key as what it resolves to, or deletes it only when
that resolution IS the default (an absent key resolves to the default). So a
retired name is adopted by removal and runs as `local` before and after, and an
unknown name is adopted as the literal `"off"` and runs as `off` before and after.
Adoption never moves the effective provider — deleting an unknown value would have
made the default `local` apply, handing the incident's user back the engine they
were escaping — and `coercion_summary` names the resolution instead of claiming
removal changes nothing. The `is_coerced` predicate rides on the ENTRY, not in the detector's loop,
so appending a retirement is genuinely sufficient — a detector switching on
`dotted_key` would leave an appended entry silently unreported, with no test red and
an operator stuck with a warning nothing can clear. That predicate delegates to
`sections.stt_provider_is_coerced()` rather than restating a provider list, so the
surface offering to remove a value cannot come to disagree with the loader about
which ones are dispatchable. The retirement notice in `_validated_stt_provider`
names the command, for the same reason the drift line does.

**Why nothing is corrected automatically.** At least one registered key also has a
documented escape hatch (`mcp_gateway.forward_declared_env`, whose stored `false`
is pinned as honoured by `test_a_real_false_still_turns_it_off`). On disk that
escape hatch and a stale materialized default are the same bytes, so a rewrite
cannot correct one without overriding the other. Telling them apart needs per-key
provenance -- a record of which keys the operator actually set -- which this layer
does not have.

## Config Overlay (config.local.json)

User overrides can be placed in `~/.kiro/crew/config.local.json`. This file is
deep-merged on top of `config.json` at load time and is never touched by
`kirocrew setup` or package upgrades. Because `save()` keeps an overlay-owned
leaf OUT of `config.json`, such a value exists only here, so the overlay rides
the dashboard export and the snapshot `config` component next to `config.json`
(see [Settings import](#settings-import-dashboard-merge)).

`config.json` is the persistent settings file, not a generated one: no upgrade
or restart regenerates or resets it. The routine writers (dashboard PUTs, keyed
`kirocrew config set`, setup, boot migrations) are locked delta
read-modify-writes of the keys they own (`update_config_locked`), and the
whole-document `KiroCrewConfig.save()` refuses to publish a snapshot of a file
it could not read (see its API entry). Two explicit, user-invoked paths replace
the document instead: `kirocrew config set --file` installs the given file
whole (under the same lock, with `on_corrupt="reset"`, so it also overwrites an
unreadable file), and the dashboard import's **Replace** installs the archive's
`config.json`. Its **Merge** never overwrites a settings document this install
has (see [Settings import](#settings-import-dashboard-merge)). The overlay is for a
value you want PINNED above whatever those writers later put in the base.

Resolution order:
1. Load `config.json` (the persistent settings file every writer updates)
2. Deep-merge `config.local.json` on top (user-owned, never touched by setup/migration)
3. Return merged result

### CLI Usage

```bash
# Pin a setting in config.local.json (wins over config.json):
kirocrew config set --local agent.yolo true

# Save to config.json (the persistent settings file):
kirocrew config set agent.yolo true
```

### `config_local_path() -> Path`
Returns `~/.kiro/crew/config.local.json` (or `$KIROCREW_HOME/config.local.json`).

### `_deep_merge(base: dict, overlay: dict) -> dict`
Recursively merges overlay into base. Dict values merge recursively; all other
types in overlay replace base values.

## Browser UI preferences (ui-prefs.json)

`~/.kiro/crew/ui-prefs.json` is a backup of the dashboard settings that live in
the renderer's `localStorage`, not in `config.json`. It exists because
`localStorage` is keyed by ORIGIN and, in the desktop app, stored inside
Electron's `userData` directory, so a moved dashboard port, a relocated
`userData` directory, a switch between the stable and nightly builds, or a
browser storage eviction wipes every setting the user chose — and reads to the
user as "the upgrade lost my settings".

Owned by `kiro_crew/ui_prefs.py`, served by `GET`/`PUT /api/ui-prefs`, and
consumed by `website/src/lib/uiPrefs.ts`. Deliberately NOT a section of
`config.json`:

- `KiroCrewConfig.save()` re-emits the whole dataclass, so a key the running
  build does not model is dropped on the next save. A bag of client-owned UI
  keys is exactly the shape that loses that fight.
- `config.json` is operator-facing; renderer layout keys do not belong in it.

Contract:

- Values are opaque strings the server never parses. For most keys the value is
  exactly what `localStorage` holds (a UTF-8 string). ONE durable key —
  `mc-chat-config`, a JSON object of ~20 independent chat settings — is the
  exception: it is NOT stored whole. Each of its fields travels under its own
  wire key `mc-chat-config.<hex(field)>`, whose value is that one field's JSON
  fragment, so the server's existing per-KEY merge becomes a per-FIELD merge and
  a profile uploads only the fields it actually changed (issue #15236; before
  this, a second origin holding one stale field uploaded the whole blob and
  overwrote fields it never touched). The field name is hex-encoded (`[0-9a-f]`,
  4 digits per code unit) for two reasons: a raw name could contain the `.`
  separator, and `showContextTokens` — a real field — contains `token`, which
  the credential denylist below would reject, 400-ing every flush. Hex provably
  contains no denied substring and no separator and reverses exactly. The server
  stays oblivious: it just holds more, smaller opaque keys. The file is
  `{"prefs": {...}}` and nothing else: an earlier revision carried a `version`
  and an `updated_at` that no code read, and the loader is tolerant of any shape
  it does not recognize, so a future reshape needs no version field to be safe.
- `PUT` is a merge patch; a `null` value deletes its key. BOTH methods are
  owner-gated: the write so a viewer cannot overwrite the owner's settings, and
  the read because some values name real paths on the host (the file explorer's
  saved state, the cloud launch defaults). Gating the read costs nothing, since a
  non-owner can never have written a backup.
- Keys whose name looks like a credential (`token`, `secret`, `password`,
  `credential`, `api_key`) are refused on write and filtered on read, so the
  dashboard bearer token can never land here.
- Bounds: 200 keys, 128-char keys, 64 KiB per value, 512 KiB total. A patch that
  would breach them is rejected WHOLE; nothing partial is written. The client
  answers a rejection by retrying the patch one key at a time, so one unstorable
  value cannot discard the valid changes bundled with it.
- An unreadable or malformed file means "no backup", never an error: the client
  falls back to whatever `localStorage` holds.
- The client reads the backup when this profile has never successfully reached
  the host (`mc-ui-prefs-synced` absent) and only fills keys that are absent, so
  it can never clobber a value the running profile already has. Keyed on
  never-synced rather than no-settings-present so a boot whose fetch failed
  retries on the next one instead of forfeiting the restore. Otherwise the client
  is write-only: the backup is a backup, not a live cross-tab sync channel.
- When the restore actually wrote something the page RELOADS instead of
  rendering. Restoring before the first render is not sufficient on its own:
  static imports are evaluated before the entry module's first statement, so a
  store that reads its key at module scope (`hooks/useBottomTerminal.ts`) has
  already captured the pre-restore value and its first write would persist that
  stale copy back over the restored one. The reload is correct for every
  module-scope reader without a per-store re-init hook, costs one extra load on a
  fresh profile, and cannot loop because the synced marker is written first.
- Every key the host holds is baselined with whatever is in `localStorage` for it
  after the restore — including a local value that DIFFERS from the host's and
  was kept. The hydrating origin is by definition the one that has not been
  syncing, so uploading its value on first flush would overwrite the newer backup
  with a possibly months-stale one; baselined, it stays in use locally and is
  uploaded the moment the user changes it. A value the quota-safe writer had to
  drop is NOT baselined, or the first flush would read it as a deletion and null
  out a good host backup.
- A FAILED first restore writes `mc-ui-prefs-hydrate-pending` holding the list of
  durable keys the profile held AT THAT MOMENT. On the next successful restore a
  key in that list — and any change the user made to it since — is the user's,
  so local wins as usual; a key NOT in the list was written after the failure by
  a page that rendered without its settings (a login screen counts; mount-time
  hooks persist defaults), so for it the HOST wins — treating those defaults as
  the user's choice would upload them over the real backup. A repeat failure
  never widens the list. A never-failed first restore keeps the normal rule.
  Letting the host win for every key instead had the mirror-image defect: a
  returning user whose GET failed once and then changed a preference saw the
  stale host value overwrite the change. The marker is cleared only after the
  synced marker is written, so a crash between the two leaves the profile
  pending rather than synced-with-untrusted-locals.
- `mc-ui-prefs-synced` also holds the NAMES this profile last synced, which is
  how a deletion made before a reload is still reported as a `null` while a key
  this profile never synced is never nulled — that is what stops a second browser
  from deleting the first one's settings.
- Which keys are durable is the client's decision (`DURABLE_PREF_KEYS`).
  Session-scoped and derived state (height caches, panel tabs, drafts, touched
  files) is excluded, as are the settings `config.json` already owns (theme
  mode/colour, language, onboarding flags) and keys a migration deliberately
  deletes (`mc-zoom`, `mc-font-scale`), so no setting has two homes and nothing
  resurrects a key a migration removed. The per-surface prefs that used to
  silently reset across origins -- notification sound (`mc-notification-sound`),
  interface mode (`mc-ui`), reading width (`mc-reading-width`) -- are durable.
- A SETTINGS IMPORT rewrites this file under a profile that has already synced,
  which the cold-profile rule above would never re-read. The client therefore
  pauses the sync before sending the import (`pauseUiPrefsSync`: no flush,
  including the `pagehide` one, may land after the import and put this page's
  values back), and when the response says `ui_prefs_restored` it calls
  `adoptHostUiPrefsOnNextLoad` and reloads: that removes `mc-ui-prefs-synced`
  and writes an EMPTY `mc-ui-prefs-hydrate-pending`, so the next load
  cold-hydrates and the HOST wins for every key it holds (by the failed-restore
  rule, a key not in the list is the host's). A key the host does not hold
  keeps its local value. Server side a Merge installs the archive's copy only
  where the host has no `ui-prefs.json` (`ui_prefs.install_imported_ui_prefs`,
  which decides under the module lock that serializes it against the PUT
  handler); a host that keeps one keeps it whole, since the browser adopts the
  host copy on its next load. Either mode holds each entry to the same
  deny-list and bounds as a PUT (an unstorable entry is dropped and counted,
  not fatal).
- GROWING the durable set is guarded by a reconcile pass (growth-gap issue
  9491). A warm profile never runs the cold restore, so a key added to the
  allowlist by an upgrade would otherwise be flushed at its local DEFAULT --
  often written by a hook on mount (`mc-ui` is the live example) -- overwriting
  the value another origin backed up. Before the first flush after an upgrade
  that added keys, the client reads the host copy once for the keys this
  profile has never synced: a key absent locally adopts the host value (with
  the same reload-if-restored rule as the cold path), a key present locally is
  baselined so the first flush does not upload it (it goes up when the user
  next changes it), and a key the host does not hold is seeded from local. The
  reconciled roster is recorded as a reserved entry inside `mc-ui-prefs-synced`
  -- deliberately not its own key, so a downgraded (pre-roster) build's next
  fingerprint rewrite sheds it and a re-upgrade reconciles again instead of
  trusting a stale roster -- making the pass one GET per allowlist growth, not
  per boot. A profile with no roster predates the mechanism and is baselined
  against the frozen pre-mechanism allowlist, so only genuinely new keys are
  reconciled: a key the profile merely never held is NOT bulk-imported from
  another origin. A failed reconcile suppresses
  the sync for the session -- flushing unreconciled keys is the exact clobber
  the pass exists to prevent -- and the next boot retries; the failed-restore
  marker applies as on the cold path, so a default written by a settings-less
  render between the failure and the retry loses to the host.
- The composite (`mc-chat-config`) rides that SAME reconcile and failed-restore
  machinery at per-FIELD granularity, with three wrinkles worth knowing before
  touching `uiPrefs.ts`:
  - MIGRATION from a host backup written by a pre-split build (one whole-blob
    `mc-chat-config` key): the whole blob is expanded into child wire keys once,
    on both the cold restore and the warm reconcile, so an existing user's chat
    settings are not lost on the first load after upgrade. A field the host
    already holds as a child key wins over the same field inside the legacy
    blob; neither copy is retired (that is more machinery than the issue needs,
    and a child key is authoritative the moment any fixed build writes it).
  - CLEARING a reconciled child: a plain key clears when it is in the synced
    fingerprints OR the reconciled roster. A child gets BOTH — a child the host
    held is fingerprinted; a child the host did NOT hold has nothing to
    fingerprint, so the reconcile records it in the roster regardless of
    outcome. Without the roster entry such a child would read as unreconciled on
    every boot — withheld from flush forever while the first flush of any other
    key fingerprinted it from a value never sent, silently dropping the user's
    choice. The reconcile trigger therefore fires only while a child lacks BOTH
    a fingerprint and a roster entry (or a legacy whole-blob fingerprint is
    still present), so a fully reconciled profile pays no per-boot reconcile GET
    and a transient GET failure cannot cost a whole session's backup.
  - DOWNGRADE: the failed-restore marker records per-field child entries PLUS
    the parent `mc-chat-config` key. A pre-split build iterates the whole-blob
    allowlist and reads ownership by the parent, so the parent entry keeps its
    stale host blob from overwriting local chat settings. A split-aware build
    does NOT treat the parent as a blanket grant over its children — it honours
    the parent only on a legacy marker that carries no child entries at all;
    when child entries are present the exact child key is required, so a default
    a settings-less render wrote AFTER the failure cannot masquerade as owned.
- Also excluded: any value that GATES A SAFETY CONFIRMATION. `mc-yolo-ack` is the
  instance — its presence makes the approval-mode picker skip the confirmation
  and enable full auto-approval — and the reason is that this file sits in the
  agent-writable data home, so a restorable ack is an ack an agent can forge for
  the user's next fresh origin. Convenience does not outrank a human gate.

## Settings import (dashboard Merge)

The dashboard export (`portability.create_export_zip`) carries every document a
Settings choice is persisted in: `config.json`, `config.local.json`,
`ui-prefs.json` and `notification_settings.json`. The snapshot `config`
component carries the same set.

Every archive settings document is vetted before either mode applies one
(`portability._vet_archive_settings`): a document that is not its reader's shape
(a config that is not a JSON object, a `ui-prefs.json` that is not
`{"prefs": {...}}`, a `channel_settings` that is not an object) is refused,
removed from the extraction so neither mode can install it, reported
`<label> (skipped: <why>)` and listed in `refused_merges`, which the handler
audits as a `partial` import. `ui-prefs.json` and `notification_settings.json`
are rewritten to their filtered form (`ui_prefs.parse_imported_ui_prefs`,
`notifications.settings.parse_imported_settings`: a credential-shaped key, an
unstorable value, a mute or lowered priority on `system.approval`, an unknown
field is dropped and counted).

The import's **Merge** (the dashboard default) never overwrites, like every
other merge in the product, and it is honest about it
(`portability._merge_settings`):

- A document this install LACKS is installed from the vetted archive copy and
  reported `<label> (restored)`: `config.json` through `update_config_locked`
  (absence re-checked under the lock; owner-only; this install's `meta`
  stamped; the live watcher woken), `ui-prefs.json` through
  `ui_prefs.install_imported_ui_prefs` (see
  [Browser UI preferences](#browser-ui-preferences-ui-prefsjson)),
  `notification_settings.json` through the running gateway's
  `ChannelSettings.install_imported`, so a restored mute applies at once.
- A document this install HAS is left untouched, byte for byte, and reported
  `<label> (kept this install's; import with Replace to restore the archive's)`.
- `config.local.json` is NEVER installed by a Merge, even where this install has
  none: the overlay outranks `config.json` at load, so an installed copy would
  set every key it names over this install's own config. `kirocrew restore
  --mode merge` follows the same rule.
- Every document the archive carried that the Merge did not apply is named in
  `settings_kept` -- the plain file names, so the list is bounded by construction
  (at most four) -- and the dashboard shows them in one notice that points at
  Replace. `ui_prefs_restored: true` is set only when `ui-prefs.json` was
  installed; it tells the dashboard to reload and re-read the browser
  preferences.

**Replace** is the path that restores the archive's settings over this install's.
It installs all four documents through `_do_replace`, which first backs up what
it replaces into a `pre-restore-<ts>/` directory. The staged documents are
owner-only (except `notification_settings.json`, whose live writer uses the
umask), so a replace never installs a config or ui-prefs document wider than its
own writer writes. The swap runs inside `ui_prefs.replacing_file()` and
`ChannelSettings.replacing_file()`, which hold each store's writer lock across the
swap (the notification store also re-reads its file before letting go), so a write
from another tab or channel cannot publish its pre-import copy over the restored
file. It then sets `ui_prefs_restored`.

## Unknown keys are preserved on round-trip

`save()` re-emits the whole dataclass, so anything the running build does not
model is absent from what it writes. Two capture fields stop that from erasing
the operator's settings on an upgrade:

- `_extra_sections` holds unknown TOP-LEVEL sections (an edition-contributed
  section written by a companion), classified against `_KNOWN_CONFIG_SECTIONS`.
- `_extra_keys` holds unknown keys INSIDE a modelled section, `{section: {key:
  value}}`, captured by `resolution.capture_extra_section_keys`. Without it, a
  build that renamed or removed `<section>.<key>` erased the value on the next
  `save()` of any kind (a log-level change, adding a workspace, editing an
  agent), with no backup on that path.

Both restore a key only when the emitted document LACKS it, so a captured copy
can never overwrite a live value or undo a deliberate deletion. `_extra_keys`
has two shapes: `{key: value}` for a dataclass-backed section, and
`{record_name: {key: value}}` for the maps of named records (`agents`,
`workspaces`, `memory_stores`), whose records are parsed field-by-field and
re-emitted with `asdict` and so lose unmodelled keys the same way a section
does. `hooks` needs neither: it is emitted raw and round-trips whole. A record
deleted in memory stays deleted — restore fills into existing records only.

A top-level key the core does not model is captured into `_extra_sections` and
round-tripped, and by default also reported as `Config: unrecognized top-level
keys`. Two exclusions from that warning are named in code:

- `CONFIG_RESERVED_TOP_KEYS` in `resolution.py` (`meta`, retired keys) — stamped
  by `save()` itself or written by an older build; never parsed, never
  captured, dropped on the next save, never warned about.
- `validation._APP_OWNED_TOP_KEYS` (`dev_fleet`) — a section a builtin app reads
  from the file directly (`dev_fleet.repo_path`, prescribed by the Dev Fleet
  "no checkout found" banner). Captured and round-tripped like any unknown
  section, and NOT reported as unrecognized: the product told the operator to
  write it. Private to the warning that is its only consumer; a second member
  is the point at which this becomes an app-declared registration.

A deprecated field is announced only when it holds something: `null` and an
empty map, list or string carry nothing to migrate, so `validation` stays
silent on them (`False` and `0` are chosen values and are still announced). A
schema entry that is marked `deprecated=True` therefore accepts that an empty
value of its type gets no notice; a field for which `""` or `[]` is itself a
meaningful choice must not rely on the deprecation notice to surface that
value. `to_dict()` also omits `telegram.accounts` when the map is empty: the
field exists only so an operator's named-account tokens survive a save, and
writing back an empty default materialized a deprecated key into every config,
which every launch then warned about.

Both capture from the BASE view of the document, not the merged one. When
`config.local.json` shadows an unknown key that `config.json` also holds, a
capture of the merged value made `save()` emit the overlay's leaf, which the
overlay subtraction then removed — permanently deleting the base file's own value,
so removing the overlay later revealed nothing. The loader therefore records the
base copy of every top-level section the overlay touches (`_shadowed_base_sections`)
at the last moment both documents exist, and captures against that. `save()`
then emits the base value, the subtraction leaves it (it differs from the overlay
leaf), and the overlay still wins on the next load. The base copy rides in the
validated-data cache's sidecar (`ConfigCache.get_with_sidecar`) so a cache hit — where
the overlay is no longer in scope — captures exactly as the disk read did.

A key is NOT captured when it is a field of the section's dataclass, starts with
an underscore, or appears in one of two explicit maps in `resolution.py`:

| map | why the key is excluded |
| --- | --- |
| `_SECTION_KEYS_EMITTED_ELSEWHERE` | `to_dict()` writes it from outside the section dataclass, either conditionally (`slack.channels`, `dm_activation`, `trusted_bot_ids` — absence is a deliberate deletion) or from the top-level object (`slack.observe_max_messages`, `observe_ttl_hours`). |
| `_SECTION_KEYS_DELIBERATELY_DROPPED` | The build chose not to round-trip it: RENAMED (`knowledge.auto_ingest_doc_links`, still read, canonical spelling written) or RETIRED (the removed local-STT install paths — re-persisting them would keep offering a setting with nothing behind it). |

A key the schema DOES model but validation rejected also stays dropped, because
re-emitting it would make the bad value permanent and re-warn on every load.

The failure direction is deliberate: forgetting an entry in
`_SECTION_KEYS_DELIBERATELY_DROPPED` preserves a key that could have been
dropped, which is cosmetic. The reverse is the data loss the mechanism exists to
prevent. `test_default_emitted_section_keys_are_all_recognized` guards
`_SECTION_KEYS_EMITTED_ELSEWHERE` against drift.

## APIs

### `KiroCrewConfig.load() -> KiroCrewConfig`
Loads config from disk. Merges `config.local.json` overlay if present.
Returns defaults if file is missing or invalid.

The installed package declares `jsonschema` as a core runtime dependency so
schema validation runs outside development environments too. The import guard
still lets an incomplete or manually damaged install load, but that fallback
must not be treated as the normal packaged behavior. Generated package metadata
is tested to ensure the validator is required without the `dev` extra.

**Hot-path cache.** `load()` is called per message / per request on several hot
paths. The expensive work — reading `config.json` (+ `config.local.json`),
`json.loads`, `_deep_merge`, and the full `jsonschema.validate` — is cached as
the validated, merged `data` dict, keyed on a fingerprint of both files
(`st_mtime_ns`, `st_size`, `st_mode`). On a cache hit, `load()` still builds
**fresh dataclasses from a deep copy**, so the many callers that mutate the
returned config in place (settings handlers, the write-back migration) never
corrupt the shared cache. The cache is mtime-keyed (not a blind TTL), so a
runtime edit is reflected on the next `load()`; `save()` also invalidates it
eagerly via `_invalidate_config_cache()`. The defaults-only path (neither file
present) is not cached, and neither is a load in which a present file could not
be READ whole (the `digestible` flag below is false). That second rule is what
keeps one transient read failure transient: with `config.local.json` present, a
base read that raised (a Windows sharing violation, an EIO) still yields an
overlay-only document, and caching it under the unchanged stat fingerprint made
every later load in the process serve the base settings at their defaults until
a file happened to change. A file whose bytes read fine but would not parse is a
stable fact about those bytes and is still cached. Pinned by
`test_config_overlay.py::TestConfigOverlayLoad::test_a_transient_base_read_failure_is_not_cached`.

**Content provenance on the cache entry.** Beside the `data` dict and its sidecar, each
cache entry carries a third fact: the digest of the bytes that data was parsed from.
`load_config_with_content_stamp()` returns a config together with that digest, and
`config_content_stamp()` reads the live files' digest on its own. The pair lets a caller
that holds a config across other I/O and later writes something derived from it tell
"my copy is still current" from "a save landed while I was working".

The digest must be bound **inside** the load, which is why it lives on the entry rather
than being read around the call. The fingerprint above is stat metadata, and a
replacement presenting the same `(st_mtime_ns, st_size, st_mode)` returns the earlier
cached object — so hashing the files on both sides of `load()` would pair the cached
data with foreign bytes and report a match. An entry carrying its own digest reports
the provenance of the data it holds: a hit answers for the bytes it was parsed from,
a miss for the bytes just read. A change to this cache that drops or re-derives the
digest therefore breaks exactly the case it exists for.

`None` means no digest can be bound — the files could not be read whole, or the document
was unusable and defaults were substituted. A caller must treat that as unknown and
never as a match; two unknown provenances in particular are not equal. The member event
log is the current consumer: see `member-event-log.md` for how a roster read and the
startup sweep each refuse to correct the log from a config they cannot name.

**Section construction.** Compound section constructors run in small private
helpers: `config/section_builders.py` holds 28 of them and `config/loader.py`
keeps the agent, session, telemetry and dashboard ones (see the Overview); the
loader re-exports all of them. This bounds each construction frame instead of
putting every field expression in one large traced resolver frame. The helpers
preserve field evaluation order, coercion, defaults, and section-local assignment
expressions. Each call creates fresh dataclasses and mutable defaults; no resolved
configuration or permission value is cached by a helper. File fingerprinting,
validation, overlay handling, cache-generation fencing, migration, degradation,
and publication remain in the existing load path. Store admission and workflow
identity checks still run at every existing call site.

### `KiroCrewConfig._resolve_agent_model() -> str`
Reads model from installed agent config (`~/.kiro/agents/kirocrew.json`),
falling back to the bundled `config_package_dir()/defaults.json` (i.e.
`src/kiro_crew/config/defaults.json`), then `DEFAULT_MODEL`.

### `KiroCrewConfig._resolve_named_agent_model(agent, agents_dir=None) -> str`
Returns a named agent's own kiro `model` field, or `""` if none. Used by
`SessionManager.get_or_create` so an explicit global `agent.model` ranks *below*
a per-agent model pin (per-agent pin > global default). Reads only the kiro
`model` slot. `agents_dir` is a dependency-injection seam for tests; defaults to
`kiro_agents_dir()`.

Reads the `agent_discovery.parsed_agent_specs` snapshot (stat-signature
revalidated, the same cache behind `agent_skill_globs`) rather than re-parsing
every spec per call. It runs synchronously on the event loop from the provider
factory — every session start and every background recycle — and a per-call
scan of a ~125-file agents directory was ~125 `realpath` calls plus twice as many
`is_sensitive_path` round trips through the two-worker `mc-pathres` pool; with
the skill scanner's bulk traffic on the same pool those waits queued and their
sum crossed the loop-stall watchdog (eight of eight dumps on the reporting host).
On-loop calls read only the cached snapshot dict and schedule at most one
in-flight revalidation per directory on `mc-discovery`; every `scandir`, stat
and parse stays on that worker. A snapshot that holds rows is served as it
stands, whether or not it names the agent, so a changed directory answers from
the previous rows until the refresh lands. An EMPTY snapshot on the loop (nothing
published yet, or just cleared) is `""` -- no pin -- and is NOT answered from the
named agent's own file: a spec read, however bounded, is filesystem IO on the
event loop, which the `no-blocking-call-on-event-loop` rule forbids regardless of
size. The one caller that resolves a pin against a cold snapshot is the persistent
background session (`_bg`, agent `kirocrew-lite`), created by `_ensure_background`
at gateway start before the first refresh lands; it is async, so it awaits
`agent_discovery.warm_agent_specs()` (labels `ensure_background`/`unknown`) before
the provider factory runs -- the same shape `warm_project_agent_names()` gives the
per-turn project resolver (see `resolve_agent_bindings` below) -- and the factory's
unchanged lookup then finds warm rows, so `_bg` is created on its own pin instead
of `agent.model` for the gateway's lifetime. The warm-up is one awaited
`parsed_agent_specs` parse on `mc-discovery`, no polling and no retry; it never
raises (a failed warm-up costs that session the cold answer), and a
`clear_list_agents_cache()` landing during the parse keeps its rows unpublished
(the generation guard), so the lookup then degrades to the cold answer exactly as
a concurrent agent write does today. A warm worker revalidation costs one
`scandir` and no parses, whereas off-loop callers revalidate and parse inline.
JSON-first
precedence for two live specs of different stems declaring one name is kept by
a stable sort on suffix, and any failure to import, walk or parse is `""`, never
an exception into model resolution.

### `kiro_agents_dir() -> Path` (`config/paths.py`)
Leaf helper returning `~/.kiro/agents` — the **user-level** scope. Lives in the leaf
module so `loader.py` (and `_resolve_named_agent_model`'s `agents_dir` DI seam) can
locate installed agent JSONs without importing `kiro_crew.agent` — which imports
`config.loader` and would create an import cycle.

Deliberately **single-valued**: it is the WRITE target as well as a read scope
(`bridges._register_agents` and `agent.rebuild_agent_config` both write here), so it
is never widened into a search path.

A third writer is the side chat's derived read-only spec,
`dashboard/side_readonly_spec.publish_readonly_spec`: `<agent>--readonly.json` (or
`<agent>--readonly-<8 hex of the project path>.json` for a project-scope base, so two
checkouts declaring the same agent never contend for one file), the active agent's
spec with every backend-side grant emptied (`allowedTools: []`, no
`mcpServers.*.autoApprove`, no `toolsSettings.*.allowed*`/`trusted*`/`auto*`,
`includeMcpJson: false`, `autoAllowReadonly: false`, an empty KAS `permissions`) and
the lifecycle `hooks` removed, regenerated from the base spec on every side turn and
written atomically only when its content changed. It is a runtime resource, never
hand-edited (an edit is overwritten on the next turn), and it lives HERE because
kiro-cli discovers selectable agents from nowhere else: this directory and the
session's `<project>/.kiro/agents`, at process start (`acp/runtime.py`). The project
scope is the user's checkout, which Kiro Crew does not write into, so the user-level
registry is the only publishable location. The derived spec declares its own `name`
so no two files declare the base agent's name (`agent.agent_spec_path` refuses that
ambiguity), and its `description` starts with the owner marker
`Kiro Crew derived read-only spec`: the writer refuses — never overwrites — a file at
the derived path without that marker, and refuses to publish at all when another
spec (project scope, or a second user-scope file) declares the derived name, because
kiro-cli would load that one instead. See `side.md`.

### `project_agents_dir(project_dir)` / `project_kiro_dir(project_dir)` (`config/paths.py`)
The **project** scope, read-only: `<project>/.kiro/agents` (kiro-cli's own workspace
agents dir) and `<project>/.kiro` (which holds Kiro Crew's older
`*.agent-spec.json` convention). kiro-cli resolves `--agent` against
`$PWD/.kiro/agents` before the user-level dir with **no upward walk**, and Kiro Crew
spawns kiro-cli with the session's project directory as its cwd, so this is exactly
the directory the backend searches for that session.

Only `.kiro/agents/*.json` is **dispatchable**: kiro-cli does not read
`*.agent-spec.json`, so `agent_discovery.project_agent_files()` excludes it unless
the caller opts in with `include_legacy=True` (only the Slack handler does, for its
own pre-existing listing/resolution). Offering a legacy-only name on a dispatch
surface would have it accepted by the picker and by `spawn_run`, then fail at
`session/set_mode`.

### `resolve_agent_bindings(config, agent_name=None, project_dir=None) -> ResolvedBindings`
Resolves the workspace, memory store and **kiro agent** a session runs under.
Resolution order:

1. `agent_name` is a key in `config.agents` — use that alias's bindings.
2. `agent_name` is a **materialized kiro agent config** — a `*.json` under
   `~/.kiro/agents/` or, when `project_dir` is given, under
   `<project>/.kiro/agents/` — whose **declared `name`** matches (the filename stem
   only when the config declares no name) — take the *default* alias's
   workspace/memory bindings but dispatch **that agent itself**. `kiro-cli agent
   list` enumerates agents by declared name, so a namespaced filename stem such as
   `mochi--mochi` is NOT a name kiro-cli can resolve and must not be treated as
   dispatchable.
3. otherwise `config.default_agent`, then the first available alias, then bare
   defaults.

`selection_kind="template"` restricts an existing conversation to the materialized
template namespace even if discovery has imported a same-named member.
`selection_kind="member"` requires the configured alias instead of falling back
to a same-named template. Both still report an unavailable explicit selection
through `requested_resolved=False`; neither flag authorizes member memory.
Dashboard callers obtain this choice from the canonical session execution record
described in [session](session.md#agent-selection-provenance).
The session resolver rejects a different agent name when a execution record
exists. Live provider switches publish their validated template choice before
history changes; ordinary resolution cannot replace provenance from metadata.

Rung 2 exists because an app's agents are materialized into `~/.kiro/agents/` by
`bridges._register_agents` under a namespaced FILENAME (`<app>--<agent>.json`)
while the config inside keeps the app's own bare `name`, and **nothing adds them
to `config.agents`** — that mapping is authored by setup / the user. Without it an
app-bound session fell through to `default_agent` and the DEFAULT agent answered
while the slot still advertised the requested name, with none of the app's MCP
tools. The rung is deliberately wider than app agents: **any** parseable config in
those directories dispatches with default bindings, because they *are* the
kiro-cli agent registry and narrowing to app-registered names would require
provenance they do not record.

`project_dir` must be the directory the session actually runs in (the same value
passed as the kiro-cli cwd).

**Neither scope touches the filesystem on the event loop.** The user-level scope is
served from the process-wide materialized snapshot (refreshed off-loop by the
writer); the project scope differs per session, so it is served by
`agent_discovery.project_agent_names()` — a per-project name set revalidated by a
stat-only signature, so a repeat scan costs two `scandir` walks rather than
re-reading every spec. `_project_declares_agent` splits on whether a loop is running:
off-loop it scans, on-loop it reads `cached_project_agent_names()`, which performs
**no syscalls at all** and reports "not declared" on a cold cache so the caller falls
back — exactly as the cold-snapshot user-level path does. Bounding the file *count*
is not the same guarantee as bounding *latency*: this runs on every turn of a
project-bound session, so a network or otherwise slow checkout would become a
recurring gateway stall the loop-stall watchdog blames on chat.

Async callers therefore **warm the cache before resolving**:
`agent_discovery.warm_project_agent_names()` runs the scan on
`executors.discovery_executor()` (the pool `/api/agents/installed` uses), after which
the on-loop read is a hit. `chat_runner._run_chat` and the side-turn handler both do
this.

`subagent._validate_agent` cannot warm — `spawn()` is synchronous and already on the
loop — so it reads the project scope from `cached_project_agent_names()` only. A
project agent is accepted once that project's cache is warm (any session that
resolved bindings for it has warmed it); a cold cache reports the name unknown, which
is fail-closed and matches that function's existing rule of refusing an unknown name
rather than silently running the default. Widening its pre-existing user-level scan to
a second directory instead would stall the gateway.

`slack/handler._resolve_agent_name` runs on the loop too, so it prefilters on the
**filename** and reads at most the one matching spec — resolving every spec's declared
name would stall Slack on a checkout with many agents.

Dashboard turns and eager allocation offload binding resolution and capture the
canonical execution record before provider work. Learned database availability
is checked by memory operations, not by persona/template admission. Their
`resolve_session_agent_bindings` wrapper converts a resolver's `StopIteration`
into an explicit unavailable-selection error before it crosses the worker
Future: asyncio cannot deliver `StopIteration` through that boundary.

`ResolvedBindings` additionally reports `requested_resolved` (whether the
requested name was honored — False means the default answered) and
`resolved_alias` (the alias key whose bindings were used). `selection_kind`
records whether the explicit selection was a template or member. Callers
persisting a member name use `resolved_alias`, never its `kiro_agent`; dashboard
template conversations retain their requested name together with their recorded
selection namespace so later alias discovery cannot change the selection.
The session resolver also captures `selection_revision` before resolving:
an empty string observes no execution record, while `None` means the caller
did not make an observation. Automatic publication checks that revision under
the writer lock before replacing a record. This transient field guards
publication. The execution record also persists a unique publication revision to
distinguish repeated selections during compare-and-set; neither revision grants
memory access.

#### App-slot cold-snapshot self-heal & fail-loud (`dashboard/chat_runner._run_chat`)
The one-turn cold fallback above is acceptable for an ordinary session (the next
turn self-heals), but it is **not** acceptable for an **app-owned** slot
(`slot._app` truthy — an App-Kit slot bound to an app's own kiro agent, e.g.
`my-app-agent`). An app agent is never in `config.agents` and is resolvable
*only* through the materialized snapshot, so a cold on-loop read makes
`resolve_agent_bindings` fall back to the default agent with
`requested_resolved=False`. The result is silent: the slot still advertises the
requested name while the generic default agent answers **with none of the app's
MCP tools and no error**, leaving the app unusable until a gateway restart happens
to re-warm the snapshot. `_run_chat` therefore guards the resolve, strictly behind
`slot._app and not bindings.requested_resolved` (zero extra work / I/O on the
common hot path — no `_app`, or already resolved):

1. **Self-heal (two escalating steps).** First, **rescan** the snapshot **off the
   loop** with the same pattern `server.py` uses at boot —
   `await loop.run_in_executor(subprocess_executor(), refresh_materialized_agents)`
   (`refresh_materialized_agents` never raises, so awaiting it via the executor is
   safe) — then **re-resolve once**. This recovers an app slot whose spec is on
   disk but whose snapshot was simply not yet warmed on this loop. If the
   re-resolve *still* misses, the spec was never materialized even though the
   source is intact, so **re-register this app's resources from source** —
   `await loop.run_in_executor(subprocess_executor(), register_app, slot._app)`
   (`register_app`, `apps/bridges.py`, registers the app's MCP servers BEFORE its
   agents and publishes the snapshot synchronously; imported via a **local** import
   inside the function to avoid the top-level `apps`↔`dashboard` cycle, mirroring
   `server.py`'s local import of `reconcile_enabled_app_resources`. `register_app`
   is used rather than the narrower `refresh_app_agents` because a never-materialized
   app also has unregistered MCP servers, and re-materializing only the agent would
   inline an empty server map — recreating an agent whose own `@<app>:<server>` tool
   refs dangle, i.e. it dispatches but its tools never mount. `register_app` already
   honors the execution-admission gate, and the recovery call is additionally gated
   on `is_app_enabled(slot._app)` held under `app_lifecycle_lock(slot._app)`, so a
   concurrent disable/uninstall cannot race recovery into reactivating a
   deregistered agent — a disabled app simply falls through to the fail-loud) —
   then **re-resolve again** and use the fresh bindings. A recovery-step failure
   only logs a warning; it costs nothing beyond the fail-loud below.
2. **Fail-loud.** If the slot is app-owned and *still* unresolved after the
   from-source re-registration, `_run_chat` does **not** run the default agent. It
   raises `_AppAgentNotLoaded` (naming `slot.agent`, e.g. *"The app agent
   'my-app-agent' isn't loaded yet — try again in a moment, or restart the
   gateway"*) which a dedicated `except` arm beside the terminal turn-error
   handlers surfaces as a normal `error` card (no `record_failure` — nothing ran).
   The raise happens *before* `get_or_create`, while no session lock is held, so
   the standard `finally` teardown runs without ever creating a session or
   dispatching an agent.

The eager-spawn pre-warm path mirrors the **self-heal** step (rescan →
re-register-from-source) only (so the speculative session bakes in the app's own
agent rather than the default, which a first real turn would otherwise have to
discard); the **fail-loud** lives on the real turn alone, since the eager path is
best-effort and tears itself down on any miss.

**Failed background starts back off, then stop.** The signals that schedule an
eager spawn (focus, reconnect, slot create, reset) recur, so a slot whose agent
cannot start would spawn and tear down a fresh process tree on each one. After a
failed background start, `schedule_eager_spawn` skips every signal for a backoff
window: 10s after the first failure, 20s after the second. Nothing is queued for
later, and the first signal after the window starts normally. (The window doubles
up to a 300s ceiling, which only a larger cap would reach.) After 3 failures in a row (`_EAGER_SPAWN_FAILURE_CAP`),
background starts for that slot stay **off until a start succeeds or the gateway
restarts**. `schedule_eager_spawn` refuses the slot, and the stop is logged once
at ERROR and posted once as an error row in the chat. The row's last-error text
is redacted and bounded to 500 characters. The user's next message still starts
the agent, and its success clears the count. The count lives only on the
in-memory `_ChatSlot`, so a gateway restart starts it at zero.

Only a failure of the agent start itself counts: an exception from the session
allocation in `_spawn_admitted_prefetch`, other than a shutdown
(`SessionClosingError`), a key being ended (`SessionEndingError`), a
speculative-resume refusal, or a capability refusal raised before any process ran
(`CapabilityError`, or a `CapabilityStartupError` code in
`_PRE_SPAWN_CAPABILITY_CODES`). A failed pending-reset consume, binding or
selection write, or admission step spawned no agent and is logged without
counting. Pinned by `test/test_eager_spawn_start_backoff.py`.

`register_app` (`apps/bridges.py`) backs the from-source recovery with a **visible
error**: when a manifest declares agents but `_register_agents` materializes none
(source missing or unreadable) it appends a `"registered 0 of N declared
agent(s)"` entry to `result.errors` — which `reconcile_enabled_app_resources`
counts and logs — instead of returning a silent 0-agent success; a partial
registration (some but not all) logs a warning.

### Materialized-agent snapshot (`config/loader.py`)
Rung 2's membership test is a process-global `frozenset` — a pure in-memory lookup
with **no filesystem I/O, not even a stat**. It is reached on every turn of an
app-bound session from the gateway event loop (`_run_chat` →
`resolve_agent_bindings`), where a directory scan would stall chat, WebSocket and
heartbeat processing (`no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`).

The snapshot is only ever rebuilt off-loop:

- `refresh_materialized_agents()` — full rescan; **must** run off-loop. Reads each
  config through `hooks.safe_read_file`, so a symlink planted in that
  user-writable directory cannot make a boot refresh read a protected file;
  refused paths are skipped. A stem is trusted only after the file parses as a
  JSON object.
- `schedule_materialized_agents_refresh()` — safe from anywhere: offloads to the
  default executor when a loop is running, refreshes inline when not.
- `publish_materialized_agents(names)` — pure set union, no I/O, so it is safe on
  the loop. `_register_agents` publishes what it just wrote **before** scheduling
  the rescan, so a slot created before the rescan lands still resolves.
- `_register_agents` / `_deregister_agents` schedule a rescan around their writes
  (unconditionally on the register side: a call that writes nothing may follow a
  prune, and only a rescan drops a name that is gone from disk).

Two guards keep concurrent updates coherent, each with a test that fails when it
is disabled: a **generation counter** bumped by every publish (a scan that globbed
before a write unions rather than replacing, so it cannot erase a just-published
name), and a **monotonic ticket** taken when a refresh starts (a completed scan is
discarded if a refresh that started later already applied, so an older view
finishing second cannot resurrect a deleted agent). A lookup with no snapshot yet
builds one lazily **only** in a synchronous context; on a running loop it falls
back for that turn rather than block.

### Effective-agent report (`resolve_effective_agent`)
`resolve_agent_bindings` stores the REQUESTED agent verbatim and only logs when
nothing dispatches it, because rewriting the stored name was destructive: the
resolution behind the rewrite can be momentarily stale while the overwrite is
permanent. `resolve_effective_agent(agent_name, project_dir)` is the
non-destructive other half — it names the agent that will actually answer, and
`""` for "nothing to report".

Two properties, both pinned by tests:

- **No filesystem I/O**, for the same reason rung 2 has none: it is called from
  `_ChatSlot.to_dict()` for every slots frame on the event loop. It reads only the
  materialized snapshot, the alias snapshot published by `KiroCrewConfig.load()`
  (`publish_agent_alias_snapshot`), and `cached_project_agent_names` — never a
  scan, stat or config re-read.
- **Fails closed to `""`.** A cold alias snapshot, a cold materialized snapshot
  and a cold project cache all report no divergence. A false "your agent was
  substituted" marker sends the user chasing a substitution that never happened,
  so silence during a boot window is the correct answer, not a guess.

Consumers: the sidebar's session-row marker, and `mochi`'s `ensureSlot`, which
refuses to send into a slot whose effective agent is someone else.

Known follow-up (#1429): the snapshot makes this module a second home for agent
discovery beside `apps/registry`.

### `KiroCrewConfig.create_provider_factory() -> Callable`
Returns a factory for LLMProvider instances. Resolves `"auto"` model
before creating the provider.

### `KiroCrewConfig.to_dict() -> dict`
Serializes config to the JSON structure used by `config.json`. Uses `_configured_port`
(the file value) instead of `dashboard_port` (which may be overridden by `KIROCREW_PORT`
env var) to avoid clobbering the saved port on write-back.

### `KiroCrewConfig.save() -> None`
Writes current config to `~/.kiro/crew/config.json` via `to_dict()`, through
`write_config_atomically()` (see below). Invalidates the `load()` validated-data
cache so the next load reflects the write immediately.

It **fails closed** and writes nothing (raises `ConfigReadError`) in two cases:

- The instance was built by a load that found `config.json` present but
  unparseable (`_base_unreadable`). Such a snapshot holds defaults rather than
  the user's settings, and that holds even if the file has been repaired since.
- `config.json` exists now and does not parse (read through
  `read_config_for_update()` under the same lock).

A missing file is still created, which is what the create-default callers rely
on.

**No dashboard module calls it.** A dashboard writer publishes the keys it owns
through `run_config_write(update_config_locked, config_path(), mutate=...)`.
`test_config_save_locking.py::TestNoDashboardModuleSavesTheWholeConfig` pins
that over `src/kiro_crew/dashboard`, matching a `.save` REFERENCE handed to an
offloader as well as a call, with an empty baseline. The workspace display PUT
(`PUT /api/config/theme`) was the last such writer: it loaded the whole config
and saved it back, so on a momentarily unreadable file (a torn read, a sharing
violation, an empty file) it published pure defaults over every setting
-- from a request the SPA sends on its own at boot, because a defaults load
reports `onboarded=false` and that triggers its legacy theme migration. It now
validates the whole body first (a 400 writes nothing), writes only the named
`dashboard.*` keys (skipping the write when they already hold those values),
answers an unreadable file with `500 {"code": "config_unreadable"}` and the bytes
untouched, and builds its response from a fresh load.

### Partial config updates: `read_config_for_update()` / `write_config_atomically()`

Many callers do not hold a whole `KiroCrewConfig` — they flip one toggle
(`auto_update`), persist one channel, or seed one default. That shape is a
**read the whole file → mutate one key → write it all back** cycle, and both
halves of it are data-loss-prone. These two helpers are the required primitives
for it; do not hand-roll the cycle.

**`read_config_for_update(path=None) -> dict` fails CLOSED.** The natural
`try: json.loads(...) except Exception: data = {}` is a bug in this shape,
because the `{}` fallback is indistinguishable from "the user has no settings" —
so the write-back replaces a fully populated config with a single-key one, every
setting the user ever chose is gone, and the endpoint still reports success. So:
an **absent** file returns `{}` (a genuine empty starting point), while an
unreadable or non-JSON-object file raises **`ConfigReadError`**. Callers must let
that abort the update; leaving the existing file untouched always beats
overwriting it with defaults. `ConfigReadError` deliberately does **not** inherit
from `OSError`/`ValueError`, so a pre-existing broad `except OSError` around the
write cannot swallow it and resume the clobbering path.

The read fails for mundane reasons, most commonly a **torn read**: a
truncate-then-write config writer leaves a window in which a concurrent reader
observes a half-written file. The window is small, which is exactly what made the
resulting loss so hard to reproduce — it presented as "all my settings reset
themselves".

The last product writer of that shape was the voice settings PUT
(`PUT /api/voice/config`), which read with `json.load` and wrote back with
`open(path, "w")` + `json.dump` -- no lock, no meta stamp, no live-watcher wake,
and every failure swallowed behind `{"ok": true}`. It now persists through
`run_config_write(update_config_locked, ...)`, merging only the keys the request
named into the existing `voice_reply` block, BEFORE it applies them to the live
voice config, so a refused write (`500 config_corrupt` on an unreadable file,
`500 config_write_failed` on an `OSError`) leaves both the file and the running
setting as they were and the panel rolls its optimistic update back.
`test_config_rmw_preserves_settings.py::TestNoRawOpenWriteOfConfig` keeps the
shape out: it fails on `open(p, <writing mode>)` or `p.open(<writing mode>)`
where `p` is `config_path()` / `config_local_path()` or a name bound to one,
with an empty baseline.

**`write_config_atomically(path, data, *, fsync=False)` is atomic AND
mode-preserving.** Atomic (tmp+rename) so no reader ever sees a partial file —
this is what closes the torn-read window for everyone else. Mode-preserving
because tmp+rename creates a NEW inode, so the umask default (typically `0644`)
would silently replace an operator's tightened `0600`; `config.json` can hold
inline credentials, so a settings write must never widen who can read it. An
existing file's mode carries over and a newly created one is owner-only. On
Windows it also applies a real owner-only DACL via
`platform_compat.restrict_to_owner` (`restrict_on_error="warn"`, so a DACL that
cannot be applied warns rather than making the config unwritable).

That is a reversal of an earlier ruling recorded here, and the reason it changed
is worth keeping: the lockdown used to shell out to `icacls`, a blocking
subprocess this function could not afford because it runs inside async request
handlers and `save()` (`no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`). It is now applied
in-process through `advapi32` (measured 0.24 ms against 313 ms for the
subprocess), so the cost that forced the omission is gone and `config.json` --
which can hold inline provider tokens -- is no longer left under whatever DACL it
inherits from its parent. Follow-up work that touches the other owner-only call
sites should treat this as settled rather than re-deriving the old constraint.

**Mode preservation is POSIX-only.** `atomic_write`'s `mode` routes through
`fchmod_safe`, a documented no-op on Windows, where access is carried by the DACL
instead. The two guarantees therefore do not collide -- they apply on different
platforms -- which is why the writer branches on `IS_POSIX` rather than passing
both to `atomic_write`, which refuses `restrict_to_owner=True` alongside a wider
explicit `mode`. The three mode/symlink tests in
`test_config_rmw_preserves_settings.py` are `skipif(not IS_POSIX)` for this reason;
its Windows counterpart asserts the DACL by reading the descriptor back, and the
data-loss and AST-guard tests are platform-independent and run everywhere.

**Symlinks are followed, not replaced.** `os.replace` renames over the link
itself, so a symlinked `config.json` would become a regular file and its target
would go stale — the `write_text` this replaced followed the link. The target is
resolved before the stat and the write, so symlinking the config into a dotfiles
repo keeps working.

**Atomicity is not serialization.** `write_config_atomically()` guarantees a
reader never sees a partial file; it does NOT serialize a read-modify-write
against another process. Two writers that interleave (the CLI and the gateway,
say) are still last-writer-wins per key, since each read its own snapshot before
mutating. In-process dashboard handlers additionally take `_get_config_lock()`,
which serializes them against each other but not against a separate process.

One deliberate exception: the interactive `kirocrew config set --local` path
overwrites a corrupt `config.local.json` rather than failing closed — the user
typed an explicit command and sees the result on stdout. Pinned by
`test_config_overlay.py::TestCliConfigSetLocal`.

### `config_dir() -> Path`
Returns `~/.kiro/crew/` (nested under kiro-cli's `~/.kiro/` base). Overridden by
`KIROCREW_HOME` env var (refuses system directories like `/`, `/usr`, `/System`,
`/etc`). It creates the selected home and, on the default path, refreshes the
recovery breadcrumb; it never reads or migrates a leftover `~/.kirocrew` tree.

### `config_path() -> Path`
Returns `~/.kiro/crew/config.json` (or `$KIROCREW_HOME/config.json` if overridden).

### Agent Bookkeeping Sidecar (`agent_model_state.json`)

A `publish` receipt on a destination entry records the owning member, original
private template and internal source/target digests plus the pinned Parent
identity. It is saved before binding publication and retained after completion
so a same-name retry can distinguish its own publish from an occupied name.
Finalization removes only `private_to` and `forked_from`; model bookkeeping and
the receipt survive. Receipts contain no transport bodies and never appear in
agent specs or API responses. See [crew-mode](crew-mode.md#owner-reviewed-capability-inheritance).

Explicit capability enrollment adds a `capabilities` object to the private
agent's existing sidecar entry, never to its harness JSON. It records schema
version 1, one pinned Parent descriptor, accepted Parent rows, explicit local
operations, the catalog URI snapshot and the saved materialization digest.
`pending` means publication has not been verified; `saved` verifies disk state
only. Neither means a provider loaded that version. Capability responses expose
runtime `status`, `saved_revision`, `sessions` and an optional `error_code`;
Parent errors live in `template.error_code`. There is no duplicate `warnings`
array or constant `runtime.apply_mode`; adoption still requires a new runtime.
Rows expose `managed` for transport ownership, not constant `editable` or
`locked_reason` metadata; managed-server Enabled remains supported.
Schema-v1 reads require
all capability section maps and validate accepted row values and persisted
`set`/`remove` overrides. Present null intent, missing sections and malformed
rows fail closed; they are never dropped or interpreted as legacy mode. The
owner API returns its bounded unavailable response without exposing source
bytes. The pinned Parent requires string name, scope, source, path and project
fields; an empty project remains valid. Optional catalog, revision, materialization
and ordinary-field bookkeeping remain optional, but present values are checked
before a consumer can use them. Publish receipts use the same Parent check;
explicit null receipts are corrupt, not absent. Known MCP transport fields are
checked before accepted or local rows
can be materialized, including string-list contents, string-valued environment
and header maps, boolean `disabled`, and positive finite `timeout`. The same
field validator runs on source transports and editor sets. Source metadata and
policy-only entries remain intact; native `oauth.oauthScopes` arrays are valid
in persisted source rows. The editor's narrower request allowlist and managed
or app transport ownership checks still apply separately. A corrupt persisted
transport refuses cold allocation before reconciliation can publish a new
spec or change a member binding. The owner API and resolver contract is
documented in [crew-mode](crew-mode.md#owner-reviewed-capability-inheritance).

Selected `accept_parent` rows must be genuine pending Parent changes in each
member's pre-operation snapshot. An explicit `inherit` in the same request may
advance that row to the current Parent (including removal) without invalidating
its selected acceptance. `inherit` also works without selected acceptance;
acceptance alone preserves local values and removal overrides. Missing or
unchanged selections still refuse with `parent_change_missing`, including when
paired with `inherit`. Batch acceptance validates every selected member before
publication; local operations apply only to the primary member, and unselected
rows and peers gain no new approvals. Stale revisions and all Parent identity,
managed transport, wildcard and ambient MCP exclusion checks remain enforced.

Capability GET, preview and PUT projections mask every non-empty environment
and header value and native `oauth.clientSecret`, regardless of length or
recognizable token prefix. Credential-bearing argument options are also masked,
including split values (`--api-key VALUE`) and inline values (`--token=VALUE`).
Complete `NAME=VALUE` argument elements also identify credentials when NAME is
an environment-variable identifier with a credential suffix, including assignments
passed after `-e` or `--env`. Values may be short and contain further `=` characters.
A bare name without `=` never consumes the following argument. The whole original
assignment is masked and retained byte for byte, without parsing a shell command.
Native OAuth edits and selected connections retain nested `oauthScopes` lists;
the shared transport validator still requires every scope to be a string.
The basic-auth forms `-u user:password`, `-uuser:password`, `--user user:password`
and `--user=user:password` are masked when the value contains a colon, including
an empty username or password.
No other short aliases or arbitrary positional credentials are inferred, and
option detection stops at `--`. A bare `-u` or a colon-free value stays visible;
another program's colon-bearing `-u` value may be conservatively masked.
Known credential copies in the same transport's strings, argument arrays and
nested metadata are masked too, without changing map/list shapes or rewriting
unrelated rows. Empty credential values remain empty. The original secret stays
on disk; a whole-transport edit retains it only through the existing signed
preview and revision-bound `retain_paths` pointer (for example `/oauth/clientSecret`
or `/args/1`) paired with `[REDACTED]`. An inline option is retained as its entire
original argument, byte for byte. A stale revision or a path to a
non-masked/non-scalar leaf still refuses without writing. Legacy reset and
publish routes also bound
strict capability and publish-receipt reads: unreadable or malformed state
returns `503 capabilities_unavailable` before any mutation. Absent intent and
absent receipts still fall through to legacy handling; owner checks remain
before these reads. Legacy PATCH and binding changes use the same bounded
`503 capabilities_unavailable` response for strict-read failures; an enrolled
legacy write remains a 409 conflict. PATCH checks both the actual file stem and
the declared name, regardless of which spelling resolved the request. It repeats
both checks using the fresh read under the existing spec lock before model
bookkeeping or spec writes, retaining the spec-then-sidecar lock order. A late
binding-check failure preserves the old binding. Legacy publish
may already have staged a private destination at that point and runs its existing
reference-aware rollback; this is rollback, not a claim that no writes occurred.

Each pending generation records only its own `materialized` digest. Failed spec
publication leaves the old generation's bytes intact; a failed final receipt can
be completed without minting another generation. Startup still refuses pending
state until reconciliation succeeds.

With ambient MCP loading enabled (`includeMcpJson` true or absent), resolved
removals of servers, tools or approval entries refuse with
`global_mcp_exclusion_unrepresentable` before publication. The check compares
the saved and final projected rows, so Parent reconciliation, selected acceptance,
per-item inheritance and whole reset cannot bypass the explicit-remove guard.
A final projection with `includeMcpJson: false` can represent these removals.

Sidecar reads are capped at 8 MiB and require a single-link regular file.
Mutators refuse unreadable state instead of replacing it with an empty map.
The stable sidecar lock refuses non-regular/multiply-linked handles and uses
no-follow opening where supported. Writes use owner-restricted atomic replace.
Capability publication takes the config lock, spec lock and sidecar lock in
that order. Config loading and catalog preparation happen before that hold;
locked publication rechecks the relevant bindings, sources and intent.
Base and config.local locks are acquired in that order before the spec and
sidecar locks. A local member keeps its binding delta in config.local; a
multi-member batch spanning layers commits one overlay delta atomically.
Public capability versions are random identifiers tied to the saved internal
materialization digest, never the digest of secret-bearing source bytes.

Kiro Crew tracks two pieces of per-agent state that are **not** part of the
kiro-cli agent schema: `model_managed` (whether an agent's `model` tracks the
shipped default or is a frozen user pick) and `cc_model` (a per-agent Claude
Code model). kiro-cli validates `~/.kiro/agents/*.json` with serde
`deny_unknown_fields` and rejects the *entire* spec on any unknown key, then
silently falls back to the default agent (`--agent <name>` resolves to default
with only a stderr "no agent with name X found" line). To keep every spec
schema-valid, this state lives in a Kiro Crew-owned sidecar
`~/.kiro/crew/agent_model_state.json` (honoring `KIROCREW_HOME`), keyed by agent
name:

```json
{
  "kirocrew":           {"model_managed": true},
  "kirocrew-heartbeat": {"cc_model": "claude-sonnet-4.6"}
}
```

- Read/written via `kiro_crew/agent_state.py` (atomic, lock-guarded near-leaf
  module: stdlib + `config.paths` + `atomic_write` only).
- `build_agent_config()` is pure (writes no spec key); `rebuild_agent_config()`
  seeds managed-state on a fresh/clean install (never clobbering a frozen pick).
- `_refresh_dynamic_fields()` sources managed-state from the sidecar and strips
  any stray `model_managed`/`cc_model` from the spec (steady-state self-heal).
  A **managed** spec's `model` is set on every refresh to the shipped default,
  or to the `"auto"` sentinel when the shipped template pins none — never left
  as-is. That is what makes the global `agent.model` reversible: the global is
  propagated into the spec when it is a concrete pick, and because a spec pin
  outranks the global in `resolve_effective_model`, returning the global to
  `"auto"` must take the pin back off or `"auto"` is unreachable from the
  configuration surface. Ownership decides who may clear: `model_managed=false`
  (an explicit user pick) and an **absent** sidecar entry (legacy status, owner
  unknown) both keep their pin untouched.
- `migrate_agent_specs()` runs at startup (top of `rebuild_agent_config`): lifts
  the keys out of every `~/.kiro/agents/*.json` into the sidecar and removes
  them (idempotent), fixing installs polluted by older builds.
- The dashboard model PATCH writes the sidecar, never the spec; agent DELETE
  prunes the sidecar entry.
- `agent_state.lift_and_strip_bookkeeping()` is the single shared
  implementation of the lift/strip/no-clobber rule above (with a type guard —
  a non-`bool` `model_managed` or non-`str` `cc_model` is stripped but never
  lifted, since coercing it could silently flip its meaning). All four spec
  writers call it — the dashboard's whole-config `PUT /api/agent/config`
  handler, the per-agent `PATCH /api/agent/<name>` handler,
  `migrate_agent_specs()`, and `_refresh_dynamic_fields()` — so none of them
  can drift from the other three.

Note: Kiro Crew uses KiroACP (kiro-cli) only — the deleted `claude_code` provider
was the sole reader of spec `cc_model`, so `cc_model` is now dead config. The
lite/heartbeat installers still write it to the sidecar (harmless bookkeeping)
purely to keep the kiro spec schema-clean; nothing in the fork resolves it.

**Invariant:** `~/.kiro/agents/*.json` must contain only kiro-cli schema keys at
all times — after install, refresh, and any dashboard edit — or kiro-cli drops
the agent and silently falls back to default.

## Monitoring runtime policy

`monitoring.max_runtime_secs` is the finite wall-clock ceiling shared by monitor
MCP tools and API mutations; it is checked when a budget is written, never
against a persisted record on load. It defaults to 604800
seconds; an operator may set up to 2592000 (30 days). Invalid config
values fall back to the shipped ceiling, and `coerce_runtime_ceiling` logs a
warning naming the rejected value and the fallback whenever a configured value
is replaced (an unset key is the ordinary default and is silent). Validation
errors quote the ceiling with a duration gloss, `(7 days)` for the default.
`monitoring.limits` reads the live
snapshot (or the loader in standalone MCP processes). Raising or lowering the
ceiling does not change existing budgets, creation times, deadlines, active
state or the generic four-hour arming default. A PR-specific daily/30-day preference belongs in that
installation's maintenance instructions and explicit new requests.

## Live config: one watcher, one applier registry

`config/live.py` is the single mechanism by which a write to `config.json`
reaches the objects that already copied a value out of it. Before it, a
long-lived object built at boot (a session manager's idle timeout, a channel
transport's allow-list, a workflow ceiling) kept its boot copy forever unless the
particular writer happened to know that copy existed — so `kirocrew config set`,
a dashboard save and an `$EDITOR` edit each hot-applied a *different* subset of
fields, and every other field was silently inert until the next restart.

Three parts, each deliberately singular:

**One poll.** `ConfigWatch` runs one background task that compares
`loader._config_fingerprint()` (mtime_ns + size + mode of `config.json` and
`config.local.json`) every `DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL_SECS` (2s, floored at 0.05).
The two `stat` calls run in `asyncio.to_thread`, never on the loop. Nothing else
in the gateway polls `config.json`.

**One kick.** An in-process writer does not wait for the tick: it calls
`live.notify_config_written()`, which sets a force flag and wakes the poll
through `call_soon_threadsafe`. The force flag matters independently of the
wake — the fingerprint is mtime-based, and a coarse filesystem clock can make a
write invisible to it, so a kicked cycle reloads whether or not the fingerprint
moved. Safe from any thread and a no-op in a process with no watcher (the CLI).

**One reload, one diff, one dispatch.** A cycle performs exactly one
`KiroCrewConfig.load()` off the loop, so the `publish_*` snapshots the loader
maintains ride along rather than needing a second reader. Old and new documents
are flattened to dotted leaf paths (`flatten_config`; lists and empty dicts are
leaves, because every list-typed field is a whole value whose consumers rebuild
from the full list) and diffed (`diff_config_docs`). The new config is adopted
*before* dispatch so an applier reading `live.snapshot()` sees it, and the
PRE-load fingerprint is recorded so a write landing mid-read leaves it unequal to
the file and the next tick reloads. Cycles are serialized by a lock, so the diff
is always old-vs-newer and an applier never sees an out-of-order pair.

### The applier registry

`live.subscribe(*prefixes, callback=..., name=...)` is the only sanctioned place
for work a gateway does in response to a config write. Rules the registry keeps:

- **Prefix-scoped.** An applier fires only when a changed path is one of its
  prefixes or lies under one (whole dotted segments: `agents` is not under
  `agent`). No prefixes means every reload — a catch-all, and a review smell.
- **Registration order is dispatch order**, so an applier may depend on one
  registered before it (a rebuild before the consumer that reads it).
- **Sync or async**, awaited if awaitable.
- **A raising applier cannot starve the rest, and is not left stale.** Each call
  is guarded; the failure is logged at ERROR with the applier's NAME and dispatch
  continues. The watcher remembers the changed paths that applier missed and
  re-dispatches exactly those to it on the next tick (a synthesized change whose
  `old` and `new` are the current snapshot), quietly at DEBUG until it succeeds;
  a real change arriving first carries the missed paths in the same dispatch. So
  a transient failure delays adoption by one poll interval instead of until the
  same fields happen to change again.
- **An awaitable applier that hangs cannot stall the rest indefinitely either.**
  Appliers dispatch sequentially under one cycle lock, so a call that never
  returns would otherwise block every applier after it and any concurrent
  `refresh_now()` caller. `_apply_one` wraps an awaited result in
  `asyncio.wait_for(..., timeout=APPLIER_TIMEOUT_SECS)` (10s); a timeout is
  logged and staled exactly like a raised exception. This bounds an async
  applier that hangs on an internal `await` — it cannot bound a synchronous
  applier that blocks the loop outright, since nothing suspends until the
  result is awaitable in the first place. Write appliers non-blocking.
- **A bound method is held weakly** (`weakref.WeakMethod`), so a manager
  discarded by a test or a provider reload falls out of the registry on its own.
  A free function or lambda is held strongly — it has no owner to outlive.
- **Values are never logged, only changed paths**: `to_dict()` carries channel
  tokens and the diff sees them.
- **`cancel()` is the removal verb** (there is no `close()`), and is idempotent.

### The three one-line registrations

`subscribe` is the primitive; almost no applier should be written against it
directly. Three shapes on top of it cover every value-adoption site and are what
a new setting registers with, in the owning object's constructor:

| Shape | When | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `live.watch_section(owner, "wecom", "messaging", target="transport")` | a subsystem owns one top-level section and exposes `reconfigure(section_cfg)` | fires under `wecom` (or `messaging`); resolves `owner.transport` at dispatch time and calls its `reconfigure(change.new.wecom)`; a `None` target (transport not connected yet) is a no-op; **fails closed** on a section the loader marked degraded (`fail_closed=True` by default and mandatory for anything carrying authorization), so an allow-list is never rebuilt from an unparseable document |
| `live.watch_object(owner, "memory", "skills.max_skills")` | an object's settings span sections or are normalized together, and it exposes `reconfigure(cfg)` | fires under any prefix and hands the whole `KiroCrewConfig` over |
| `live.bind("agent.max_channels", mgr.set_max_channels)` | one scalar with an existing setter | calls `setter(value at that path)` when that leaf changes |

All three hold the owner weakly (through the setter's `__self__` for `bind`),
so a discarded object drops out of the registry like a weakly held bound
method. What they remove is the per-site ceremony that used to be copied by
hand — the prefix gate, the `None`-transport guard and, above all, the
degraded-section refusal, which is an authorization safety check and must not
exist as nine hand-written copies. What stays on `subscribe` is orchestration
rather than value adoption: the in-process channel restart, the provider
switch, the SEL-audited approval widening, the Slack section's fan-out.

`ConfigWatch.replay(sub)`, called on a subscription `watch_object` just returned,
closes the registration gap for an owner that applied a config it loaded itself.
A reload adopts its config and only then
snapshots the registry, so one that snapshotted before the owner registered never
reaches it. Run right after registration: when the
watcher's fingerprint still matches the file, it hands the adopted snapshot to the
applier, re-reading it after each apply so a reload landing mid-replay is not undone;
when the file has moved past the snapshot (or nothing is fingerprinted yet), the
snapshot may be older than the owner's own load, so it marks the subscription stale
for its prefixes and the next tick delivers the new document even where it leaves
them unchanged. A deferred, failed or async applier is marked stale the same way.
Unstarted watchers (nothing adopted) make it a no-op. `VectorMemoryStore` is the one
caller, and replays only when it was built with `config=` (a raised
`memory.episodic_max_count` adopted during construction is not lost); a `config=None`
store keeps its constructor defaults at construction. The other `watch_object`
owners that copy caller-loaded config before registering (`cron_history.py`,
`subagent.py`, `history_consolidation.py`, `adaptive/controller.py`,
`slack/gateway_runtime/admission.py`) keep the registration gap; they are out of scope for #10889.

### The point-of-use read

`live.current(fallback, log_prefix=...)` is for a call site that reads a value
mid-turn rather than reacting to a change — every channel dispatcher's per-turn
threshold and DM-scope reads. It returns the watcher's `snapshot()` when armed,
else a disk `KiroCrewConfig.load()`, else *fallback* (with a warning naming
*log_prefix*) when even that raises. `snapshot()` alone is not enough for these
callers: a dispatcher can run before the watcher is primed (see boot ordering
below) or in a process with none at all, and `current` is the one place that
disk-load-then-fallback chain is written, rather than nine copies of it.

A load that raises keeps the previous snapshot, records `last_error`, dispatches
nothing, and retries on the next tick. A file that does not PARSE as a JSON
object right now (`_document_is_torn`, checked on the file itself because the
loader's degradation flag is sticky for the process) also keeps the previous
snapshot's VALUES — only the flag is taken from the new load, so the gates
that fail closed on `degraded_sections` still see it — and diffs empty, so no
applier and no `current()` reader ever sees the all-defaults document the
loader answers for an unparseable file (a forum activation of `always`, an
empty allow-list, for the length of the tear). Once the file parses again the
load is adopted as it is, still flagged, and a repair to new values diffs and
dispatches them. A load that *succeeds degraded* with the file parseable (a
section the loader itself discarded, named in `degraded_sections`) does
dispatch: the watcher does not refuse on the applier's behalf, because whether
a default is safe is a property of the consumer. A fail-closed applier — every
channel allow-list — reads `change.new.degraded_sections` and keeps its previous
authorization state; a plain one (a timeout, a log level) adopts the default,
which is the correct answer for it.

A fail-closed refusal is **deferred, never dropped**: the applier raises
`ConfigDeferred(paths)` and the watcher records those paths in the same stale
table an applier exception lands in (logged once at WARNING, then at DEBUG while
the applier keeps deferring). The same exception carries a second meaning for one
applier: the channel-restart applier raises it before the transports have
started, so a boot-window edit waits in the stale table and is applied by the
first tick after they are up — through `_apply_one`, with the degraded check,
rather than by a replay of the boot loop's own. The distinction matters because the watcher adopts the
degraded document as its snapshot — the refused section at DEFAULTS — so a
repair that writes back exactly those defaults diffs EMPTY. Before this a skip
was a silent success and nothing would ever re-run the applier: a revocation
written alongside a malformed field stayed unapplied for good. Now every clean
load re-runs the stale appliers against the current document even when it has
nothing to diff (`_retry_stale` on the empty-diff and unchanged-fingerprint
paths), so the roster catches up with the repair. `_section_applier`,
`_object_applier`, the `bind()` leaf applier (a discarded section holds a leaf's
DEFAULT, and a bound setter handed that default would reset a cap or a ceiling),
`_on_slack_config_change`, `_on_channel_config_change` and the session manager's
applier all raise it; the channel applier raises only the DEGRADED channels'
paths after scheduling the healthy channels' restarts, so the retry never
restarts a channel twice.

The refusal keys on the applier's OWN section being in `degraded_sections`, never
on the whole-config marker `*` alone. The loader keeps every degradation it has
observed for the life of the process (`resolution._OBSERVED_DEGRADED_SECTIONS`:
its gates must stay closed after a save has normalized the evidence away), so a
document loaded after a since-repaired tear still carries `*`; an applier that
refused on it would defer every tick until a restart while each save reported
applied — a revocation written after one transient typo would never land. It
does not need to: a document that is torn NOW never reaches an applier, because
the watcher keeps the previous snapshot while the file does not parse (above),
and the one way the two could disagree — a write landing between the loader's
read and the torn-file probe — is closed in `_cycle`: when the probe finds the
file whole but the load carries `*`, the fingerprint is re-read, and a read the
file moved under is treated as torn (previous snapshot kept, next tick reloads).
So on a dispatched change `*` is only the loader's memory of a repaired tear,
and the section flags — which the loader assigns only to the fail-closed
sections `dashboard`, `memory` and `publish` (validation removes a malformed
non-object anywhere else before the loader could flag it) — are the ones a tear
never produces and a save destroys the evidence of, hence the ones that stay
sticky and keep their appliers deferred until the restart main documents for a
malformed fail-closed section.

Where appliers live: an applier owned by a long-lived object registers in that
object's constructor (session manager, subagent manager, each channel
dispatcher; `WorkflowService` binds `agent.workflow_run_timeout_secs` to its
`set_timeout_secs` and `ChannelManager` binds `agent.max_channels` /
`agent.max_channel_agents` to its cap setters, both with `live.bind`). Only the
ones whose holder is `DashboardState`, or that must rebuild agent artifacts,
live in `server.py::_register_config_watch` — `agent.provider`,
`agent.model`, `agent.role_models.background`, `agent.log_level`
(→ `handlers/updates.py::apply_log_level_from_config`), and
`dashboard.dynamic_dashboard_cards` (→ `DashboardState.set_dynamic_cards_enabled`). The log-level applier
shares `apply_log_level` with the Logs page's `POST /api/logs/level`, and that
one function moves the `kiro_crew` logger only — which is the ONLY level gate
on the way to `gateway.log`: the file handler and the queue handler
`cli._setup_cli_logging` installs carry no level of their own (kiro_crew
records are gated at the kiro_crew logger, third-party records on the detached
gateway's root-attached handler at the root logger's WARNING), so the runtime
change reaches the file with nothing else to update. The handlers used to hold
a boot-time copy of the level that nothing updated, so a gateway booted at
WARNING dropped its raised INFO records before the file until a restart while
the live Logs stream showed them (#14231); a level re-added to either handler
is that bug again, and `test_cli_logging.py` pins the contract.
Both model appliers rebuild the installed agent specifications before the
watcher finishes dispatching the change. After a successful `agent.model`
rebuild, its applier emits a refresh frame, so dashboard PATCH responses and
that frame expose the new effective model only after the corresponding
specification is ready, including when the value is cleared back to `auto`.
If the rebuild fails, the applier logs the failure and emits no refresh frame;
the previous specification and effective-model readout remain in force. It also
raises an actionable dashboard notification and remains stale in the watcher,
which retries the rebuild on later ticks until the generated spec catches up.
The first successful retry emits both the refresh frame and a recovery
notification, so the operator is not left with a stale failure message after
the saved model becomes active.
The provider applier only schedules the switch: `reload_provider_factory` clears
the session registry and then shuts the retired providers down one at a time,
which can outlast the applier bound, and a timed-out applier is retried on the
next tick — a retried switch would clear the sessions created with the new
provider in between. So the switch runs off the cycle as a task tracked in
`state._background_tasks` (the same shape as a channel reconnect), the applier
returns at once, and the switch runs exactly once per change. Because it runs
later, it installs the watcher's snapshot current at install time rather than
the document it was scheduled with -- a change that landed in between (a
`refresh_defaults` install) must not be reverted -- and falls back to the
scheduled document only when that snapshot is torn, since a torn `agent`
section holds defaults.
That function must be called before `runner.setup()` freezes the signal lists;
the watcher itself starts in `on_startup`, because it needs the running loop, and
stops in `on_cleanup`.

### `restart=True` is the single source of restart truth

`ConfigEntry.requires_restart` in `config/schema.py` is the ONE statement of
which fields a running gateway cannot adopt. It is emitted into the schema API as
`requiresRestart` only when true (absent means hot), and `requires_restart(path)`
resolves it through ancestors, so a marked container covers keys the schema never
enumerates (`mcp_gateway.stub_servers.<name>`, `agent.jail.<key>`).

Consequences, and they are the point:

- A request handler keeps **no list of boot-only keys**. The dashboard's PUT
  computes `restart_required` as
  `_changed_paths_need_restart(changed)` over the schema, and the old
  `_STARTUP_READ_AGENT_KEYS` ladder is gone.
- The hint is computed over paths whose value actually **moved**. The dashboard
  sends every setting on each save, so "was applied" is not "was changed" — an
  untouched `restart=True` field must not make a live edit claim a restart.
- Adding a hot-appliable field is a schema change plus an applier, never a
  handler edit. Marking a field `restart=True` is the admission that no applier
  exists for it.
- That admission is enforced, not conventional: `ConfigWatch.subscribe`,
  `watch_section`, `watch_object` and `bind` refuse (`ValueError`) a prefix at
  or under a `restart=True` path at registration time, so an applier for a
  boot-only field cannot be added without first dropping the mark — and the
  owner's own constructor tests trip it. A section-wide registration
  (`"whatsapp"`) stays allowed: its applier adopts the section's live fields
  and ignores the marked leaf. `agent.approval_mode` is marked for this reason:
  every channel dispatcher resolves it once at start, so no single consumer may
  take it live.
- **Review checklist for a new field.** An unmarked field is a UI-visible
  promise ("this applied live"), and nothing mechanical ties that promise to
  code. So a PR that adds a config field must name, in its description, one of:
  the applier that adopts it — normally one line, `live.watch_section` /
  `live.watch_object` / `live.bind` in the owner's constructor, or a new field
  read inside an existing `reconfigure` — the point-of-use read
  (`live.snapshot()` at the call site) that makes construction-time capture
  irrelevant, or the `restart=True` mark. A field with none of the three is the
  silently-inert bug this design exists to kill, now with the settings UI
  affirming that the value took effect.
- **A reload that can widen approvals is audited.** `HookManager` follows
  `hooks.*` live, and `config.json` — sealed read-only against an in-sandbox agent
  shell — is still written by every settings surface outside the seal (the config
  PATCH, the operator CLI, an unsandboxed spawn), so its applier SEL-logs an
  `auto_approve_tools` / `auto_approve_sources` /
  `auto_approve_subagent_*` change (`hook_manager.reconfigure`,
  `auto_approve_changed`, counts and flag names only) the way the channel
  transports audit an allow-list reload. Governance still caps the resulting
  set; the audit closes the gap between "widened at a restart" and "widened in
  two seconds, mid-session, with no trace".

Currently marked: `agent.jail`, `agent.dangerously_skip_permissions`,
`agent.approval_mode`, `dashboard.url`, `dashboard.tailscale.*`,
`dashboard.restore_sessions`, `dashboard.restore_window_minutes`,
`dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs` (read once at boot to build the loop-stall
watchdog),
`dashboard.surface_channel_sessions`, `dashboard.cautious_boot`,
`dashboard.auto_open_browser`, `tunnel.*`, `instances.*`, `mcp_gateway.*`
(every field of the section), `memory.embed_model_id`, `memory.embed_model_path`,
`memory.embedding_dim`, `slack.command`, `whatsapp.db_path`, and
`messaging.dm_scope` — the last because it names the session-key namespace whose
per-conversation generation counters are seeded at boot, so a live flip could
resume a stale session persisted under the other namespace. The schema is the
source of truth for this list: `requires_restart()` over `SCHEMA_REGISTRY`
answers it, and this prose is a reader's convenience.

The broker's admission keys are in that `mcp_gateway.*` set and ride the
daemon's argv from `GatewayManager._spawn_once`: `spawn_concurrency_initial`
(4), `spawn_concurrency_min` (1) and `spawn_concurrency_max` (8, raised on the
daemon's argv to the subagent ceiling when that is higher --
`mcp_gateway.admission.derive_spawn_gate_ceiling`) size the
daemon-global spawn gate (a fixed count of backend spawn+initialize windows in
flight, FIFO past it; the band is what the adaptive controller later moves the
live value within); `spawn_queue_wait_secs` (600) is the CEILING on how long a
queue-aware stub is held before a `capacity` refusal and matches the DEFAULT of
the stub's own reconnect budget (`stub.py` `_RECONNECT_TOTAL_BUDGET_SECS`, a
constant the stub reads no config for, pinned equal by
`test_stub_reconnect_budget.py`); the wait the daemon actually arms is
`min(asked, key)` less `daemon/admission_protocol.py::_QUEUE_REFUSAL_MARGIN_SECS`
([`mcp.md`](../../architecture/mcp.md#admission-before-allocation)), so the
daemon gives up strictly first and raising the key above 600 s buys a queued stub
no extra wait — what the stub asked for caps it before the margin comes off, and
that constant is what has to rise instead. Because the key's help text is the
only statement of this an operator reads, `test_config_baseline.py` pins the
sentence against that arithmetic rather than leaving it to review;
`initialize_timeout_secs` (10) bounds a fresh backend's first
`initialize` and is threaded onto each `Backend` as a constructor field;
`host_budget_max_procs` / `host_budget_max_rss_mb` / `host_budget_max_fds` (all
0) cap what the host budget admits across pooled, private and fallback
backends, where `0` means derive from the available-memory sample the gateway
takes at spawn and the daemon's descriptor soft limit (processes never below
`max_backends`; memory left unbounded). The loader clamps them (floor ≥ 1,
ceiling ≥ floor, budgets ≥ 0). Semantics and the wire protocol they govern:
[`docs/architecture/mcp.md`](../../architecture/mcp.md#admission-before-allocation).

### Which write paths kick the watcher

Every door onto `config.json` ends at `notify_config_written()`, so the dashboard,
the CLI and an `$EDITOR` save all reach the hot-apply path identically. A writer
that forgets the kick is one setting that stays silently inert until the poll
happens to notice — which is the bug class this closes.

| Write path | Where |
|---|---|
| `update_config_locked` | `config/loader.py` — the required path for new mutations; skips the kick when the mutate returns `None` (no write) |
| `KiroCrewConfig.save()` | `config/loader.py` |
| `_persist_config_migration` | `config/loader.py` — a boot migration is a config write like any other |
| `refresh_config_meta_stamp` | `config/loader.py` — kicks only when the stamp actually moved (no rewrite, no mtime churn) |
| `_atomic_json_write` | `agent.py` — via `_notify_if_config_write`, and ONLY when the target resolves to `config_path()`. A safety net rather than a route: no handler writes `config.json` through it — the per-channel savers (`messaging._LockedSectionWrite`), the STT PUT and the MCP gateway-enable toggle all go through `update_config_locked`, and `TestTheAtomicJsonWriteConfigFamilyIsRatcheted` pins that population to an empty baseline so a new saver cannot reopen it |

A handler that must answer only after the new value is in force calls
`ConfigWatch.refresh_now()` (`handlers/core.py::_hot_apply_after_write`), which
forces one cycle and is a no-op before the watcher is started. The config PUT
and every per-channel saver (the `*_settings.py` owners in `dashboard/messaging_api/`,
the WhatsApp saver in `handlers/whatsapp_setup.py`) do, because their writes carry authorization: a
narrowed allow-list is applied to the running transport before the caller sees
"saved", never one poll interval after it. For a connection field the same
dispatch also drops the old client's mirror registration synchronously and
schedules its reconnect, so a request that follows the response (a WhatsApp QR
start, a mirror send) is never handed the client about to be closed.

**A two-file save runs under `live.hold()`.** A saver that writes `config.json`
and then `.env`, and rolls the config back when the credential write fails
(Slack, Teams, Webex, WeCom, Feishu), wraps the whole transaction — snapshot through
rollback and the `os.environ` sync — in `with live.hold():`. Without it the
config write's own kick (`_atomic_json_write` → `notify_config_written`) wakes
the watcher while the handler is still awaiting the `.env` write, and a widened
allow-list the committed state never granted is applied to the running transport
for the length of the failing write. Under a hold the cycle records that a
reload is owed and returns without loading; the release wakes it on the
committed (or restored) file. The Discord and Telegram savers commit `config.json`
and then `.env` with no rollback, so they have no rollback window and need no hold.
Pinned for WeCom by `test_wecom_config_handlers.py`
(`test_the_config_and_env_writes_run_under_the_live_config_hold`) and for the
watcher itself by `test_config_live.py`.

Tests: `test/test_config_live.py` (diff, registry, lifecycle, fingerprint,
dispatch order and scope, every write path, the schema/handler agreement, the
`server.py` appliers, and the owned-applier shapes `watch_section` /
`watch_object` / `bind`) and `test/test_channels_a_hot_reload.py` (every
channel's applier, its fail-closed degrade refusal and its point-of-use reads,
parametrized over the case table in `test/_hot_reload_helpers.py`;
`test_channels_b_hot_reload.py` and `test_channels_c_hot_reload.py` carry the
per-channel claims that are not shared).

### Per-crew avatar override (`agents.*.avatar`)

`KiroCrewAgentConfig.avatar` is a sparse override, exactly like the per-crew
`model` and `session_color` fields: absent or `{}` means the face is derived from
the crew's name (zero migration). `_safe_avatar` (`config/sections.py`) is the
total coercer applied on load, in the create/update endpoints, and nowhere else,
and it is deliberately NOT re-exported from `loader.py` — the loader's
`from kiro_crew.config.sections import (...)` list is a frozen pre-split snapshot
(`test_config_module_boundaries`), so post-split internals are reached through the
`sections` module. Three accepted shapes:

- `{"kind": "ghost", "traits": {eyes, brows, mouth, accessory, prop: str; blush,
  flip: bool; tile: "#rrggbb"}}` — string traits are truncated to 32 chars and
  are NOT checked against the frontend's trait vocabulary (the renderer resolves
  an unknown option to "absent", so a new hat needs no backend release);
  booleans must be real JSON booleans (`bool("false")` is `True`, so a
  string-typed value is read as `False`); `tile` is the one pinned value — it is
  interpolated into SVG markup, so it goes through the same `#rrggbb` validator
  as `session_color`. An all-empty trait set drops the `traits` key rather than
  storing a featureless third state, and a ghost override left with nothing but
  `kind` collapses to `{}` (the one canonical "reset" spelling). `traits` is
  therefore optional: `{"kind": "ghost", "sounds": {...}}` is valid and means
  "name-derived face, plus these per-state reactions". The ghost is the ONE tier
  that carries `motions` and `sounds` (below).
- `{"kind": "image", "v": <int>, "file": "<16-hex>.<png|jpg|webp>"}` — the crew
  wears an uploaded picture served from `GET /api/agents/{name}/avatar`; the
  file itself lives under `<data home>/run/avatars/` and the record only marks
  the choice. A picture has no face to move, so it carries no `motions`; it does
  still carry `sounds`, because the shipped renderer plays a crew-record cue
  whatever face it draws (`CrewStateAvatar.tsx` reads `soundsFrom(avatar)`
  kind-agnostically). Retiring the key here ahead of that renderer would silence a
  crew on an unrelated save with no way to restore the sound. `v` (a positive real int; `True` is rejected) is the cache-busting
  mtime stamp the frontend appends as `?v=`; `file` pins the exact committed,
  content-addressed variant and must match `^[0-9a-f]{16}\.(png|jpg|webp)$`.
  Wire-only keys (`promote`, `token`) never reach the record.
- `{"kind": "pack", "id": "<pack id>"}` — the crew wears an appearance pack from
  the crew library (`GET /api/appearances`, specified in
  `learn-cron-dashboard.md`, *Crew appearance library*). `id` is validated by
  `appearance_packs.safe_pack_id`, the SAME function the pack store applies to a
  directory name, so a value that persists here can always be looked up; a
  second copy of the character class is what would drift. A junk id collapses the
  whole override to `{}` rather than storing `{"kind": "pack"}`: a pack avatar IS
  its id, so an override naming no art has nothing to render. Whether the pack
  still EXISTS is deliberately not checked — config load must not touch the disk,
  and a pack deleted out of band would otherwise make the whole config unloadable
  instead of making one face fall back — so a dangling id renders as the
  name-derived ghost on the client. A pack carries its own per-state art
  (`GET /api/appearances/{id}/slot/{slot}`) and its own per-state audio
  (`GET /api/appearances/{id}/sound/{state}`), so it needs no `motions` on the
  record. It keeps accepting `sounds` for the same reason the picture tier does --
  that key is audible today on every tier -- and retires it in the change that
  makes the pack's own audio what plays. **A pack survives a faceless save.** The
  shipped crew editor rebuilds the override from a closed ghost/picture shape,
  so for a pack-wearing crew it renders the name-derived face and any unrelated
  save (a model change, a colour) submits `{}` — or `{"kind": "ghost", ...}`
  carrying only the ghost tier's own reactions — which read as reset would
  silently clear a pack set through the API. `PUT /api/agents/{name}` therefore
  keeps the current pack id when the record is a pack and the save names no face
  (`dashboard/agent_admin/avatars.py::_carry_pack_through_faceless_save`), and rides the save's
  `expressions` and `sounds` onto the kept pack: both are still legal on every
  tier here, and a pack's own cue answers a different route (`/sound/{state}`)
  than a crew-record cue does, so the two do not collide. Only `motions` is left
  behind, because it is the ghost's alone. Both carried keys are now vestigial —
  the shipped editor authors reactions on the ghost tier alone and submits
  neither on a pack — and they retire with the validator change that drops them. It is narrow: ghost and picture keep
  their reset semantics; `avatar: null` (which the editor never sends) is
  still an explicit reset that takes the pack off; a real face — a ghost with
  traits, a picture, another pack — replaces it. The carve-out exists until the
  picker can display a pack, at which point the editor round-trips it itself.
  **A ghost's `motions` survive a save that does not name them** for the same
  reason (`dashboard/agent_admin/avatars.py::_carry_motions_through_motionless_save`): the shipped
  editor rebuilds a ghost draft from the axes it can draw and submits exactly
  those, so a `motions` pick set through the API would be erased by the next
  unrelated save with no click that meant it. The rule is the tri-state
  `save_pack` gives a pack's cues — a payload with NO `motions` key leaves the
  stored ones alone, a payload naming the key (`{}` included) replaces them —
  and it applies only when the stored record and the validated save are both
  ghosts: a tier change is a real face replacing the old one and `motions` is the
  ghost's alone, and a reset (`null`, `{}`, the all-empty collapse) means reset.
  It retires with the frontend change that submits `motions` itself.

**Per-state reactions (`motions`, `sounds`).** Where a reaction may be stored
follows from which tier can play it, and the two keys differ. `motions` is the
GHOST's alone: it names a built-in animation of a trait-composed face, so a
picture has nothing to move and a pack animates from its own files. `sounds` is
legal on EVERY tier, because the shipped renderer reads a crew-record cue
kind-agnostically — so this is the one reaction key that is not the ghost's. Both
are keyed on the agent lifecycle state (`working`, `done`, `error` exactly; any other
key is dropped, so a version-skewed caller cannot grow the key set):

- `motions: {"done"?: "none"|"bounce"|"nod"|"sparkle", "error"?: "none"|"shake"|"cross-eyes"|"droop"}`
  — a built-in reaction animation the frontend implements. Each state has its OWN
  vocabulary (`_AVATAR_MOTIONS`) and a value from the other state's list is
  dropped: `{"done": "shake"}` would play a failure animation on success, which is
  not what its author wrote. There is no `working` entry — the ghost's working
  animation is its idle breathing, and a reaction fires on a transition. `"none"`
  is kept as explicit stillness, distinct from an absent state, so one state can
  opt out of a motion the others use.
- `sounds: {"<state>": "none"|"chime"|"ding"|"blip"|"pop"|"pulse"}` — a
  synthesized cue preset. Unlike a trait value this IS pinned to a vocabulary,
  because the name selects a shipped preset rather than an option the renderer can
  resolve to absent. `"none"` is explicit silence, distinct from an absent state
  (also silent). No per-crew audio upload exists: a crew that needs its own audio
  wears a pack, which carries its own.

Either key is omitted from the record when validation leaves it empty, so a
stored avatar never carries `{}` for one, and a key illegal on this tier is
DROPPED rather than refused — `{"kind": "image", "motions": {...}}` loads as a
bare picture. No stored cue is lost by that rule: `sounds` stays legal wherever it
already worked, so an existing picture- or pack-wearing crew keeps the sound its
owner chose. Junk (`motions: "x"`, `sounds: {"working": 5}`, a list) is stripped
silently and never refused: the same forgiveness traits get, so a malformed
reaction costs that reaction and never the crew's whole avatar. `expressions`
(a per-state `eyes`/`mouth` pick, which `motions` supersedes) round-trips on
EVERY tier — `{"<state>": {"eyes"?: str, "mouth"?: str}}`, only those two
axes, 32-char truncation, empty strings dropped — but that round-trip is now the
last of it: the picker is gone and no renderer draws it, so the key is carried
only so a record written by the previous release survives the gap until the
validator change that drops it. `sounds` on a picture or a pack is vestigial in
the same way, for the same window. `sounds` stays for the same reason on every tier, and only
`motions` is tier-gated. The roster leaves all three keys intact rather than masking them
(`_roster_avatar`), for the same reason it leaves `file` intact — a value pinned
to a closed vocabulary is not user-authored text, and masking it would break the
reaction while destroying nothing an attacker could have put there.

Anything else — a non-dict, an unknown `kind`, a ghost override carrying no
trait, motion or sound that survives validation — collapses to `{}` on load (config.json is hand-editable,
so junk must never crash the load), while the endpoints answer a
non-empty raw value the coercer collapses with 400 `invalid_avatar` — except a
well-formed ghost override whose traits all coerce to absent, which is the
validator's own all-empty → reset rule rather than caller junk and so stores as
the canonical reset. The staging
and commit protocol behind the image tier is specified in
`learn-cron-dashboard.md` (*Crew avatars*).

### Computer use: no `enabled` field here

`ComputerUseConfig` carries display and limits only. The switch for native desktop
GUI automation lives **outside `config.json`**, on the keystone at
`~/.kiro/crew/computer_use.json` (path via `config.loader.computer_use_state_path()`,
leaf on `security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`):

```json
{
  "enabled": false,
  "allowed_apps": [],
  "extra_denied_apps": []
}
```

The absence is deliberate and the precedent is `denied_commands.json`:
`is_sensitive_write_path("~/.kiro/crew/config.json")` is `True` (the *tool* path is
protected), but `is_sensitive_bash_command("echo x > ~/.kiro/crew/config.json")` is
`None` — `config.json` is not among `_WRITE_PROTECTED_BASH_LEAVES` (which fences
only a few specific control files elsewhere under the home). A config
toggle would therefore be flippable by a prompt-injected agent through any shell
redirect.

- **`enabled`** — the primary enable for full desktop observation plus input
  synthesis. A security ceiling, so it goes where the agent can neither read nor
  write it. Read with a strict `is True` identity test, so a truthy string such as
  `"enabled": "false"` does **not** enable desktop control, and the read fails soft
  to `{}` → **off**.
- **`allowed_apps` / `extra_denied_apps`** — the operator's own narrowing. These
  are the ONLY other keys `PolicyConfig.from_state` reads.

**There is no `allow_pointer_move` key, and writing one has no effect.** An earlier
revision documented it here as a second consent switch for `click_method: "global"`
(the one path that warps the real mouse pointer), gated together with a
`capabilities.computer_use_pointer` governance row. Both were removed by product
decision: there are no `computer_use.*` governance scopes at all, and
`from_state` reads only the three keys above, so a hand-written
`{"enabled": true, "allow_pointer_move": false}` silently grants the pointer path —
the operator would believe they had withheld consent. What actually contains that
path is that the model must NAME the method (`auto` never resolves onto it) and every
use is SEL-audited under its own `tool_kind`. Do not re-document the flag without
re-implementing it. See [security.md](security.md), [governance.md](governance.md)
and [computer-use.md](computer-use.md).

### Decisions: no `enabled` field here either

`DecisionsConfig` carries the sampling share (`bucket`) and the provider block only.
Consent to send message text and skill descriptions to Jev lives **outside
`config.json`**, on the keystone `~/.kiro/crew/decisions_consent.json` (path via
`config.loader.decisions_consent_path()`, module `decisions.consent`, leaf on
`security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` and `sandbox._CREW_READONLY_LEAVES`):

```json
{
  "enabled": false,
  "endpoint": ""
}
```

`endpoint` is the `provider.endpoint` the owner consented to; the gate sends only
while the configured endpoint still equals it, because that field is in this
same settings file. Same reasoning as `computer_use.json` above: `config.json` is
sealed read-only against an in-sandbox agent shell (`sandbox._CREW_READONLY_LEAVES`;
see security.md) but remains an ordinary settings file every config writer reaches
without an owner gate, and every `decisions.*` field is hot-applied by the live
watcher, so an `enabled` toggle here would be one settings edit away from starting
the egress of the owner's conversation without a restart. Reads fail soft to `{}` → **not
consented**, and only a literal `true` consents. The only writer is the owner-only,
browser-called `PUT /api/decisions/consent` (`dashboard/handlers/decisions.py`);
`PATCH /api/config/kirocrew` refuses `decisions.enabled`, and an `enabled` key written
into the section by hand is inert — the parsed dataclass has no such attribute. See
[decisions.md](decisions.md).

#### `computer_use.cursor_motion` — the one new `config.json` flag

Cursor Motion (the cosmetic fake-cursor desktop overlay) is the exception that
proves the rule above: it belongs in `config.json` precisely *because* it grants no
capability. `computer_use.cursor_motion` is a **display preference, default OFF** —
the overlay draws an image, never moves the pointer, cannot deliver input, and is
invisible to `screencapture`, so an agent flipping it could at most decorate its own
clicks. A keystone flag would imply a security decision that does not exist.

`overlay.cursor_motion_enabled()` reads it through `getattr(section,
"cursor_motion", False)` **even though the field is now declared** on
`ComputerUseConfig`, and that stays deliberate: it makes the read
**forward-compatible and fail-OFF**: a build whose `ComputerUseConfig` predates the
field resolves to OFF rather than raising inside a tool call, and a missing field can
only ever mean "no decoration", never "start drawing on the user's screen".

Three consequences for this module: `"computer_use"` MUST be present in
`_KNOWN_CONFIG_SECTIONS` (the guarded invariant that `to_dict()`'s emitted sections
equal that set); the dashboard's `_EDITABLE_CONFIG` exposes only the limits
(`computer_use.max_tree_nodes`, `computer_use.screenshot_max_px`) — never an
`enabled` key; and every numeric knob is clamped to
the same `*_LIMIT` ceiling the MCP tool schemas enforce, so a hand-edited
`config.json` cannot ask for an unbounded accessibility walk or a full-resolution
screenshot.

### Security-Bounded Config Clamp

Resource-limit and timeout knobs are clamped to hard ceilings **at load time**, not
just at the dashboard write gate. The ceilings are owned beside the field models
in `sections.py` and re-exported by `loader.py`; the load-time clamp remains in
`loader.py`:

| Constant | Value | Field |
|----------|-------|-------|
| `SUBAGENT_AUTO_MAX_CEILING` | 64 | `agent.subagent_auto_max`, `agent.max_subagents` |
| `SUBAGENT_MAX_TURNS_CEILING` | 1000 | `agent.subagent_max_turns` |
| `SUBAGENT_TIMEOUT_MIN` / `SUBAGENT_TIMEOUT_MAX` | 60 / 86400 | `agent.subagent_timeout_secs` |
| `POOL_SIZE_MAX` | 10 | `session.pool_size` |
| `CHAT_TURN_TIMEOUT_MIN` / `_MAX` | 300 / 86400 | `agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs` |
| `TOOL_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_MIN` / `_MAX` | 30 / 7200 | `agent.tool_approval_timeout_secs` |

`_SECURITY_BOUNDED_FIELDS` lists each `(section, key, min, max)`; the mins match
the existing runtime floors (0/1) so a legitimate in-range value is never
altered. `_clamp_security_bounds(data)` runs **once on the disk-read (cache-miss)
path, before the validated dict is cached** — so subsequent cache hits already
serve clamped values. It clamps out-of-range real integers in place (a JSON
`true`/`false` bool or any non-int is skipped and left to dataclass
coercion/defaults), logs a WARNING, and emits a best-effort `config_bounds_clamped`
SEL security event (never fatal — config loading must not raise).

Two **cross-field** clamps run after that generic pass, so both operands are
already in range:

- `agent.max_subagents`: 0 is the auto-size sentinel, so an explicit pin below
  `MAX_SUBAGENTS_FIXED_FLOOR` (3) is raised UP to the floor.
- `agent.tool_approval_timeout_secs` is pulled to `APPROVAL_TURN_MARGIN_SECS`
  (60) below `agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs`. An approval window that reaches the
  turn ceiling can never fire: the turn is cut first and reports itself as a turn
  timeout, so the unanswered approval is never named and an unattended run burns
  the whole ceiling on every prompt. `dashboard/turn_dispatch.py`
  `tool_approval_timeout_secs()` repeats the cap against the **resolved** ceiling,
  which the ACP prompt timeout can lower below the configured one, and then
  against the budget REMAINING in the running turn (`_TURN_DEADLINE`, published by
  `_bounded_turn`). The arm-time bound is the one that makes the invariant hold
  for a prompt arming late in a long turn; with under a margin left it returns
  `0.0` and the runner declines without waiting.

Why load-time (not just the API): the REST API rejects out-of-range writes, but a
direct edit of `config.json` (any process running as the same OS user — including
a prompt-injected agent with file-write access) bypassed that gate entirely. Each
knob controls a resource-consumption dimension (concurrent subagent processes,
per-subagent turn budget, pre-warmed pool processes), so an inflated on-disk value
could exhaust host memory/CPU/the process table (DoS). The dashboard write gate
(`dashboard/handlers/core.py`) and the runtime pool cap **import these same
constants**, so write-gate / load-clamp / runtime-cap cannot drift apart —
closing the direct-config-edit DoS gap.

### `resource_limits`: one block, three mechanisms, two meanings of `0`

`ResourceLimitsConfig` (`config/sections.py`, re-exported by
`config/loader.py`) carries the kernel confinement ceilings for spawned agent
processes. It is the one config block whose keys are
read by more than one enforcement mechanism, and two of those keys mean
**different things** to two of them:

| Key | POSIX rlimit (`security.apply_resource_limits`) | cgroup v2 scope (`sandbox.cgroup_scope_argv`) | xdist (`resource_status`) |
|---|---|---|---|
| `max_open_files` | `RLIMIT_NOFILE`; `0` = leave inherited | — | — |
| `max_processes` | `RLIMIT_NPROC`; `0` = leave inherited | `TasksMax` (counts THREADS); `0` = use default | — |
| `max_memory_mb` | `RLIMIT_AS`; `0` = leave inherited | `MemoryMax`; `0` = use default | — |
| `max_cpu_seconds` | `RLIMIT_CPU`; `0` = leave inherited | — | — |
| `cpu_weight` | — | `CPUWeight`, 1..10000 | — |
| `max_cpu_percent` | — | `CPUQuota`, opt-in: unset emits no property | — |
| `max_total_memory_mb` | — | slice `MemoryMax` (all trees together) | — |
| `max_total_processes` | — | slice `TasksMax` | — |
| `xdist_auto_cap` | — | — | `-1` auto, `0` off, `N` fixed |

`0` cannot be normalised away in either direction. On the rlimit path it is a
documented request ("leave the inherited limit unchanged") with existing configs
behind it; on the cgroup path systemd **rejects** a zero property and the scope
never starts, so `0` there has to mean "use the module default" and the ceiling
is never left unset. Every field is therefore `int | None`, and `None` ("not
configured") stays distinct from `0`.

Defaults deliberately do NOT live in the dataclass. Each mechanism keeps its own
(`security._RLIMIT_DEFAULTS`, `sandbox._CGROUP_DEFAULT_*` /
`_default_max_memory_mb()`), because a copy here would be a third default set
that could drift from both.

**Single parse site.** `ResourceLimitsConfig.from_raw()` is the only code that
coerces these keys; `_limit_int` is its rule. Before #3474 six readers each had
their own, which is how the two meanings of `0` drifted apart with nothing
recording it. The rule: bools are not numbers (`True` would become a 1-task
ceiling); a non-integral float truncates toward zero (`512.5` -> `512`, so a
stricter parse can never loosen a ceiling); a value in `(0, 1)` is REFUSED
because `int()` would turn it into the `0` that already means something else;
NaN and `±Infinity` (both producible by `json.loads`) are refused before `int()`
can raise on them; and an out-of-range value is refused rather than clamped, so
a confinement ceiling is never silently moved away from the number in the
operator's file. Every refusal is logged once per key per process.

`test_resource_limits_schema.py::TestSingleParseSite` fails if a seventh reader
appears.

### Dashboard theme persistence

`DashboardConfig.theme_mode` / `theme_color` / `onboarded` are workspace-persistent
(shared across ports and devices) rather than browser-local. The frontend reads
them at boot via `GET /api/theme/boot`; empty `theme_mode`/`theme_color` mean
unset (the frontend falls back to `localStorage` or the built-in default).

### Sidebar folder order

`DashboardConfig.folder_sort` is the chat sidebar's folder sort mode — `custom`
(the stored per-container `order` positions set by dragging or by the
`chat_folder_move` tool; the default, so an upgrade changes nothing), `name` (an
ASCII-case-insensitive natural order, so `01.` < `02.` < `10.` and `alpha` < `Beta`;
only `A`-`Z` fold, every other letter compares as written, because that is the one
fold both readers perform identically without a Unicode table) or `created` (newest first
on the `created_at` epoch stamp every folder creator writes). It is workspace-
persistent rather than browser-local because two readers must agree on it: the
sidebar (and the folder pickers) through the shared `GET /api/config/kirocrew`
query, and the `kirocrew-dashboard` MCP server's `chat_folder_tree`, which reads the
same `config.json` through the loader (the HTTP route is cookie-only) and lists
folders in the order the sidebar draws them so an agent can pick a `before`/`after`
anchor from it (see `docs/architecture/mcp.md`). Written only through the
`PATCH /api/config/kirocrew` allowlist (`dashboard.folder_sort`, enum
`FOLDER_SORT_MODES`); the loader reads anything outside that set as `custom`.
Choosing a mode is a VIEW change — no folder's stored `order` is rewritten — so
switching back to `custom` restores the manual arrangement exactly; the sidebar
re-sorts when the save lands (the success write into the shared `kirocrewConfig`
cache), not on the pick, so every reader of that cache switches together. A sidebar
drag among siblings is a write to the stored positions computed against the drawn
order, so it is offered only when the mode is known to be `custom`: outside that
(and while the settings query is still loading or has failed, when the tree draws
the stored order as a fallback) the folder rows stop being reorder targets — their
sortable's droppable side is off, so no slot opens — while dragging a folder into
another still works; before the FIRST read lands no folder drag is offered at all
(both sortable sides off, no grab cursor), since nothing on screen could yet say
why a lift died at the drop. The status line that answers a withdrawn drop carries
a **Switch to Custom** action on the same write path as the menu row. What the UI
keys on is what it KNOWS, never the transient query status (`useFolderSortRead`):
the mode is known when a config body is on hand — fresh, cached, or kept across a
failed background refetch, which react-query retries on its own and which is
therefore silent; a read that failed with no body to fall back on is said on an
`ErrorNotice`, held through the retry's pending phase (`errorUpdatedAt`, so an
observer mounted mid-retry reports it too) so the banner does not unmount and
remount around each automatic retry, and cleared when a body arrives.
One screen says it once: the sidebar's banner over its tree (the plain title leads,
the server's own words sit under it as a smaller line -- they stay the notice's
`message` because that string is the error-journal key the hand-off reads -- then
a plain subline and the hand-off stacked under the text), and, on the screens with
no sidebar, the job form beside its folder picker and the Command Bar above its
folder list. The subline is ONE phrase wherever this failure is said -- *All
folders are shown, in your Custom order; retries automatically* -- because a person
may see it on up to four surfaces at once and two phrasings read as two failures,
and it says that membership is intact, since a picker under a failure notice was
not trusted to still list every folder; where the
notice carries no hand-off of its own (the job form and the Command Bar: unsaved
input beside them) it adds *Open the chat sidebar to ask the agent about it.* The
session menu
and the folder-suggestion card say nothing of their own while the sidebar is on the
screen; when it is not (a phone with the drawer closed, a desktop with the panel
collapsed, embed chat) they say it themselves — the menu in the rule's in-menu form
(passive notice, the picker's subline, a sibling **Ask the agent** item described by
the notice, a separator closing the block), the card as the same notice above it
without a hand-off, with the picker-plus-pointer subline.

The **Folder order** rows (*Custom* / *By name* / *By date created (newest first)* -- the
direction spelled, as the session rows spell theirs, and worded so
that no label mirrors the chat session sort rows in the same menu, whose heading
names its object, **Sort sessions by**, because two orderings in one menu read as
sorting twice; and *Custom*, not *Custom order*, under a heading that already says
"order") are offered in every sidebar lane. The flat lane draws no folder tree and the conductor lane nests
by lineage, but the mode is not idle there: every row menu's **Move to folder**
picker, the history search's folder groups, the Command Bar, the job form and the
MCP tree all list in it, and the menu rows are the only control that writes it -- a
mode a person cannot change from the lane they are in would be a trap. Only the drag
note under the rows (*Folders can be dragged into place in Custom order only*, a
fact about the modes -- not the sidebar hint's "Switch to Custom" sentence, which
sits beside a button that does the switching and would read as an inert action
here) is confined to the lanes that draw a folder row to drag (the tree, and the
board unless flat view empties its columns of folders). In `created` mode a second
fact line joins it whenever a folder in the list has no `created_at` -- a folder
from before the stamp existed -- because the comparator puts such rows after every
stamped one, in the stored order: on a pre-upgrade tree that is the order the person
already had, and the pick looks broken unless the menu says why (*Folders made
before dates were recorded have no date; they come last, in your Custom order*);
`chat_folder_tree` states the same fact in its header for the agent reading the
tree, so neither reader takes that stored-order tail for a date order. The hint itself stays until
the person's next interaction away from it -- a pointer or key landing anywhere but
on the line -- a switch back to Custom, or the next drag; never a clock, which took
the action away from under a hand reaching for it. The mode's saves go out ONE at a
time, in pick order (react-query mutation `scope`): two picks inside one round-trip
would be two concurrent `PATCH`es to the same path, and the server persists
whichever arrives last -- a delayed first request would land after the second and
store the earlier pick, and the settle-time refetch would then draw that order as
if chosen. Queued behind an in-flight save, the newer pick's request starts when
the previous one settles, so the last pick is both the last request the server sees
and the persisted one; a refusal behind a newer pick is not reported (the newer
save's own outcome is).

### Interactive model picker visibility

`DashboardConfig.model_picker_hidden_models` is a workspace-persistent list of
model IDs hidden from interactive chat model pickers. The default is `[]`, which
shows the full advertised list. The loader accepts only string arrays, trims and
deduplicates entries, and ignores empty strings and `auto`. The dashboard PUT
endpoint applies the shared model-ID grammar and a bounded list length. Changes
apply to ChatPage and ChatPane without a restart; they do not alter `/api/models`,
entitlement, defaults, role or fallback models, bulk switching, crew editors, or
app-specific selectors. `model_picker_configured` records the first successful
visibility save and is read-only through the dashboard API; the same atomic write
that replaces the hidden list sets it. Existing configurations with a non-empty,
valid hidden list migrate to configured, while an empty or invalid legacy value
does not dismiss the first-use shortcut.

### Dashboard UI language

`DashboardConfig.language` selects the dashboard interface language. It rides the
same two endpoints as the theme fields — surfaced by `GET /api/theme/boot`
(unauthenticated, so the SPA can pick a language before the token flow completes
and avoid an English flash) and written by `PUT /api/config/theme`
(`{"language": "<tag>"}`). Both responses are built by one helper
(`handlers/core.py::_theme_payload`), so every read site returns the same shape.

Resolution precedence, implemented in `website/src/i18n/detect.ts`:

1. this config value (mirrored into `localStorage['mc-lang']` for a synchronous
   first paint),
2. the browser's `navigator.languages`, matched exact-then-primary-subtag
   (so `zh`/`zh-Hans` resolve to `zh-CN`),
3. `en`.

`""` is a first-class value meaning **auto-detect**, not "missing" — the picker's
Auto option writes `""` to clear a previous explicit choice. An explicit choice
always outranks detection, so a user who selects English on a zh-CN machine is
not re-detected back to Chinese on the next load.

A cross-tab `storage` event is also an explicit user choice. Once one arrives,
`LanguageProvider` refuses to adopt the older `/api/theme/boot` response that may
still be in flight, so the UI, local mirror, and workspace write cannot diverge
because of response ordering.

The picker's Auto row is labelled plain **"Auto"**, not "Auto (follow browser)".
The desktop app has no browser preference to follow — its locale comes from the
OS — so naming the browser was wrong on that surface. The row annotates itself
with the language Auto actually resolves to ("Auto — Deutsch"), which answers the
question accurately on every surface.

The backend's **write path** validates **shape only** (`_LANGUAGE_TAG_RE`, a
conservative BCP-47 subset), not membership in the set of shipped catalogs — a
well-formed tag with no catalog stays writable and falls back to detection
client-side. The **agent-injection read path** additionally requires catalog
membership: `context.ui_language_tag()` checks the tag against
`context._UI_LANGUAGE_CATALOGS` (a mirror of the non-dev-only
`SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` entries) and treats a non-catalog tag exactly like
`""`/Auto — no `[UI LANGUAGE]` steer is emitted, so the agent is never steered
to a language the chrome cannot render (#1130). Adding a language is therefore
the three frontend edits — add `locales/<tag>.json`, register the picker entry
in `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES`, and add the static import plus `AUTHORED_CATALOGS`
entry in `i18n/catalogs.ts` — **plus one mechanical backend entry** in
`_UI_LANGUAGE_CATALOGS`, which the drift gate in
`test/test_context_ui_language.py` names explicitly on failure.

Shipped catalogs (ordered by global speaker count, which is also the picker
order): `en`, `zh-CN`, `hi`, `es`, `fr`, `bn`, `pt`, `ru`, `de`, `ja`, `ko`, `it`. Right-to-left
languages are deliberately **not** shipped yet: the catalogs would translate
fine, but the dashboard's layout uses physical-direction utilities (`pl-*`,
`left-*`, `text-left`) and unmirrored directional icons, so an RTL locale would
render correct text in a visibly wrong shell. RTL requires `dir="rtl"` plus a
logical-property conversion first.

All catalogs are **statically bundled**, so `t()` stays synchronous (see the
rationale in `website/src/i18n/index.ts`). The cost is that every user downloads
every language: at 8592 keys the catalogs share one chunk that is **~173 KB gzip
per catalog, ~2.0 MB gzip for the twelve combined** (`npm run analyze`, then gzip
the `assets/t-*.js` chunk). This is tolerable only because the dashboard is served
from a loopback gateway — over a network it is already past the point of
justification, and each further catalog adds another ~173 KB to every user's first
load regardless of the language they read.

The documented next step is therefore to keep `en` static and lazily fetch the
active non-English catalog. That seam is already isolated to
`website/src/i18n/catalogs.ts` — the module that owns every catalog import — plus
a `<Suspense>` boundary in `main.tsx`; no call site changes, and
`registerCatalogs()` is where a fetching backend hands its catalog over.
**Catalog #13 belongs behind that seam**: Korean is #12 and the last one this
chunk absorbs in front of it. Re-measure when the seam lands — the figure above
is what says whether it worked.

#### The tag reaches the agent, too

`context.py::_build_ui_language_section` injects the configured tag — after the
catalog-membership gate described above — into session
context as a `[UI LANGUAGE] <tag>` block (next to `[CURRENT AGENT]`/`[RUNTIME]`,
and in `minimal_context` mode as well). It exists for one string: the tool-call
purpose, which the dashboard paints as the tool-call pill label and the
messaging renderers reuse as the task title. Which field carries that string
depends on the harness — the Kiro backend's reserved `__tool_use_purpose`
argument, or the `description` field other backends' shell tool takes beside
`command` (`acp/_dispatch.py::select_tool_title` reads it first) — so the block
names both; a model on the second kind never sees a field called "purpose" and
would otherwise miss the steer. That is the only piece
of model-generated prose rendered as *chrome*, and without the block the model
has nothing to go on and mirrors the language the user typed in — an inferred
signal that flips mid-session the moment the user pastes an English stack trace,
and one that persists, since purposes are stored in session history.

Reading it back off the wire matches by **shape**, not by a list of literals.
kiro-cli injects the `__tool_use_purpose` property into every tool schema it
exposes, and echoes it back in `rawInput` as either that name or a camelCased
`__toolUsePurpose` — but nothing validates the key, and the model paraphrases
it: `__purpose`, `__thinking_purpose` and `__woohoo_purpose` all appear in real
transcripts. `acp/_dispatch.py::extract_tool_purpose` prefers the canonical
spellings in `acp/types.py::TOOL_PURPOSE_KEYS`, then accepts any *reserved*
(dunder-prefixed) key whose name ends in `purpose`
(`_dispatch.py::is_tool_purpose_key`), scanned in sorted order so the reading is
deterministic. It is the single reader for both transports; matching literals
drops the purpose for every paraphrased spelling, and the concise pill silently
falls back to the raw command line while the unrecognized key leaks into the
arguments view as if it were a real parameter. The dunder prefix is what keeps a
tool's own functional `purpose` argument out of the match.
`website/src/utils/toolPurpose.ts` is the frontend mirror, used by the
pending-approval preview and the Mochi approval bubble.

Three properties are load-bearing:

- **`""` injects nothing.** Auto is resolved client-side by `detect.ts`; the
  backend does not know the outcome, so there is no truthful value to inject and
  un-configured installs keep byte-identical context.
- **The raw tag is injected, not a display name.** A backend code→name table
  would be a second list to keep in sync with `SUPPORTED_LANGUAGES` and would
  degrade to the tag for anything missing from it regardless. Raw is not
  unchecked: the builder re-validates the shape (`_UI_LANGUAGE_TAG_RE`, a
  superset-safe local mirror of `_LANGUAGE_TAG_RE`) and drops anything that is
  not tag-shaped. `PUT /api/config/theme` is not the only way a value reaches
  the field — the loader coerces whatever the JSON holds into `str`, so a
  hand-edited `"language": null` arrives as the literal `"None"` — and a value
  that lands in the system prompt should not depend on its writer having
  validated it.
- **Scope is the purpose text only.** The block says so explicitly, because
  widening it would collide with the base prompt's rule to reply in the user's
  language.

It is best-effort steering with no enforcement path: nothing validates the
language a model actually emits.

#### The tag also names the session

Auto-titling (`dashboard/chat_title.py`) asks a background model for the session
name that renders in the chat sidebar, and that name is chrome by the same
argument as the tool-call purpose above: the date group headers, filter labels and
rename menu around it are all in the UI language, and the name is *persisted*, so
one written in the conversation's language leaves two languages on the row for
good. With no directive the model simply mirrors the language of the prompt it was
given — measured on `claude-haiku-4.5`, a fully Chinese conversation is named
"Chat Title Language Mismatch".

The tag reaches the titler through the **prompt**, not the `[UI LANGUAGE]` block:
titling runs on the shared `_bg` session, and that block scopes itself explicitly
to tool-call purpose text. `chat_title._ui_language()` resolves the same tag
through the shared `context.ui_language_tag()`, and `_build_title_prompt()`
interpolates a directive into the prompt's `{language}` slot — outside the
delimited transcript, so a message that quotes the directive cannot restate it.
`""` omits the slot entirely and the prompt stays byte-identical to the one
auto-language workspaces have always sent.

Two consequences fall out of naming in a non-latin script:

- **The prose guard needs a second ceiling.** `label_guard.looks_like_prose`
  (shared by every label path -- the session title, the Slack/Telegram
  conversation name, the nav link chips and the session summary -- and reached
  from `chat_title` through its `_looks_like_prose` alias) rejects a reply that
  is a sentence rather than a name, and its word ceiling counts `str.split()`
  tokens — which is 1 for any length of Chinese, Japanese or Thai.
  `TITLE_MAX_UNSPACED_CHARS` bounds those scripts by character instead, counting
  only unspaced-script characters so latin identifiers in a mixed title stay
  free, and the full-width terminators `。！？` are matched without the ASCII
  rule's trailing-whitespace requirement (those scripts do not space after
  punctuation). Both ceilings are parameters, because the prompts differ: the
  title defaults (12 words / 24 characters) sit above its 3-6 word contract,
  and the 18-word session summary passes its own. A short refusal with no
  terminator remains a documented false negative for those unspaced scripts.
  Korean is spaced, so the word ceiling bounds its long sentences, but a SHORT
  Korean refusal clears every other check -- and Korean puts the refusal verb
  last, so English-style prefix openers cannot catch it. `looks_like_prose`
  therefore also matches Korean sentence shape: the sentence-final polite
  conjugations (`KO_SENTENCE_ENDINGS`, the formal "-nida" family and the
  informal-polite "-yo" family) plus the apology opener (`KO_PROSE_OPENERS`),
  which a title as a noun phrase never carries. A plain-form (banmal) Korean
  refusal remains a documented false negative, and a sentence-form Korean
  title loses to the fallback name -- the deliberate direction of the trade,
  since a fallback name is still the user's own words while a stored refusal
  is the bug. The sentence-shape signals (terminators, Korean conjugation) and
  the narration openers (`PROSE_OPENERS`) are parameters too, for the one path
  whose label IS a descriptive sentence: the session summary runs the guard
  with `sentence_shape=False` and without the conversation-referring openers,
  since "the conversation covers ..." is its legitimate shape and a false
  positive there is re-spent on a model turn at every later list.
- **The reveal animation needs characters.** The sidebar types a new title in one
  word at a time; a single-token title skipped the animation entirely, so
  `_title_reveal_prefixes` steps unspaced scripts two characters at a time
  instead, landing in the same step count as an equivalent latin title.

`_clean_title` strips the full-width and CJK quote/period forms (`「」`, `“”`,
`。`) alongside the ASCII ones, since that is what a zh/ja reply wraps a name in.
It also keeps the reply's first line only -- the rule
`messaging/auto_title.clean_title` states as "Keeps the first line only" -- so a
`SKIP` verdict followed by a reason collapses back to the bare control word.
`_validate_title_reply` treats BOTH taught control words (`SKIP`, `KEEP`) as
no-title sentinels on every path, matched case-insensitively, alone or with a
punctuation-separated reason on one line (`label_guard.is_verdict_reply`, the
same check the messaging namer and the session summary run against their own
taught word) -- while a real title that merely opens with the word ("SKIP and
KEEP handling", "KEEP-ALIVE header bug") survives.

### Response verbosity reaches every agent

`dashboard.verbosity` describes how the PERSON wants replies to read, so it is
delivered as session-context chrome — the same class as `[CURRENT DATE]` and
`[UI LANGUAGE]` — not as a token an agent prompt has to opt into.
`context_assembly/sections.py::_build_response_preferences_section(cfg)` renders the level's
rules (`_reply_style_rules`) inside a `[RESPONSE PREFERENCES — MANDATORY]` …
`[END RESPONSE PREFERENCES]` frame whose one sentence of preamble states that the
rules bind every reply, on every surface, for every agent, and outrank any
response-style guidance in the agent prompt. `default` and any unknown value
render `""`, so an install that never touched the setting sees byte-identical
context.

`build_message` mints the frame as its own trusted part on every session-start
turn (full, `minimal_context` cron, and slim resume), placed AFTER the scrubbed
session-context block rather than inside it, so a built-in agent, a custom
agent spec and a cron digest all receive it at the same once-per-session cost.
The placement is load-bearing: both frame markers are in
`_STRUCTURAL_MARKER_RES`, so a forged frame inside memory, channel history or a
peer's message is rewritten to `[marker-removed]`, and a frame that rode inside
the scrubbed block would be rewritten too. The genuine frame is therefore
minted only after the scrub, exactly as the post-compaction skills index is.

A `subagent:` session is the one kind that does NOT receive the frame
(`_response_preferences_apply`, resolved through the same runtime-source seam
as `[RUNTIME]`): its final message is read by its parent agent, which needs the
caveats and edge cases the `ultra` and `answer_only` levels tell the writer to
drop.

Session-start context is what compaction drops, so `build_message` re-injects
the block on a continuing turn with `needs_reinjection` set, beside the skills
index, under a `[REINJECTED AFTER COMPACTION — response preferences]` line. It
re-reads the setting at that moment: a level changed mid-session is what comes
back, not the pre-compaction copy. The messaging pipeline
(`messaging/dispatch.py`) consumes and forwards that one-shot flag the way the
dashboard chat runner does, so a channel session's compaction re-injects the
skills index and this block.

The earlier delivery — a `{{VERBOSITY_BLOCK}}` token expanded wherever an agent
prompt carried it — is retired. No shipped prompt (`config/prompt.md`, the
conductor/worker prompt constants in `agent.py`) carries the token, and `test/test_verbosity_config.py` pins that;
`_resolve_prompt_templates` still strips a stale token from a spec copied before
the move so the literal never reaches the model. `context_blocks._MARKERS` knows
the frame as `response_preferences`, so the context-breakdown panel attributes
its bytes to their own block rather than to `[UI LANGUAGE]`.

`{{WIDGET_BLOCK}}` deliberately stays a prompt token. `dashboard.widget_density`
is not a preference about the person; it describes what the rendering surface
can show, and `_resolve_prompt_templates` already gates the block on
`has_dashboard_surface(session_key)`, so a session with no chat window gets
none of it whatever the prompt says. There is no author-diligence gap to close.

### Foreign-agent import onboarding state

`DashboardConfig.import_onboarded` is a separate workspace-persistent gate from
`dashboard.onboarded`. The import gate controls the first-run foreign-agent
review; `onboarded` continues to control the existing theme/feature onboarding.
The import gate is evaluated first. Completing or skipping import sets only
`import_onboarded`; it does not silently complete the later onboarding.

For backward compatibility, a config that omits `dashboard.import_onboarded`
is migrated from `dashboard.onboarded`. An already-onboarded user therefore
starts with `import_onboarded=true` and retains legacy status past the new first-run
gate, while a new or not-yet-onboarded workspace sees import before the existing
onboarding. `GET /api/theme/boot` exposes the resolved `import_onboarded` boolean
alongside the existing non-secret theme boot fields.

The frontend also recognizes the older browser-only `mc-onboarded` marker when
no `mc-import-onboarded` marker exists. Before applying false server defaults,
it persists both onboarding flags through `PUT /api/config/theme`; an explicit
newer import marker remains a cache only and continues to yield to server state.

Foreign settings are never deep-merged into `config.json`. The importer applies
only its explicit non-security settings allowlist, preserves every existing
Kiro Crew value on collision, and reports unsupported or secret-bearing source
settings without copying them. Foreign credentials, security policy,
approval/sandbox settings, agent/runtime state, hooks, and arbitrary unknown
config sections cannot enter configuration through this path.

### Meet CrewMates first-run state

`DashboardConfig.crewmates_onboarded` records that the four-step "Meet CrewMates"
flow (`website/src/components/MeetCrewmatesFlow.tsx`) was finished or dismissed.
The four steps introduce goal ownership, choose a name and starting setup,
collect the desired outcome and run schedule, and confirm the goal and next run.
The shared chapter shell hides floating decorative mascots below `sm` so they
cannot overlap the headline or body in the stacked mobile header.
Examples describe outcomes (issue triage, current release notes, passing checks),
not event triggers. The introduction explains chats, dashboards, notes and
requests for a human decision; it does not promise uninterrupted execution.
The daily schedule accepts a minute-precision `HH:mm` time, defaulting to
`09:00`, with the browser's IANA timezone displayed beside it. Daily jobs set
`strict_schedule: true` so random jitter cannot shift the chosen time. That zone is
captured once per opening and used for both the cron and confirmation. An
empty or invalid daily time prevents both button and Enter submissions before
any create request. Hourly and on-demand choices do not require a time.
Back preserves the selected time; reopening resets it. The ready screen repeats
the submitted goal as plain text and formats the chosen time in the UI locale.
The today/tomorrow label is calculated when creation completes, at minute
precision; the selected minute itself counts as passed. Failed schedule writes
show their recovery notice without a next-run claim. This flow creates a crew
and optional recurring schedule, not a separate goal-completion control loop.
Whether the workspace has seen the flow is the ONLY condition on showing it:
existing crewmates and custom agents do not suppress it (`useMeetCrewmatesGate`
reads neither the roster nor the installed agents). It opens once, at the first
of: the end of the first-run tour for a new user while the Crew Members preview
(`PREVIEW_CREW`, Settings → Developer → Feature Previews — the switch that shows
the Crewmates page) is on, or the first visit to the Crewmates page (the page
announces `mc-crewmates-page-entered`, and the gate opens unless
`crewmates_onboarded` is already true on the server). The tour-end path keeps
its `mc-crewmates-pending` timing so a workspace that finished first run before
the chapter shipped is not interrupted on its next load; that workspace gets
the flow on its first Crewmates page visit instead. This supersedes the
earlier custom-agent exclusion (`docs/request-for-change/rfc-crewmates-launch.md`,
"Existing installs") per that RFC's screen 08 amendment of 2026-09-28. The crewmate name is free-form: `POST /api/agents` keeps it as the crew's
label and derives an id-shaped key from it (`members.key_new_crew`), so spaces
and CJK are accepted. The flow disables Next only on a blank name; the server's
`validate_member_name` is the gate, and a 400 `invalid_member_name` or
`credential_shaped_name`, or a 409 `agent_exists`, lands as an `ErrorNotice`
under the name field.  Notices
follow `errors-use-error-notice`: the agent hand-off is on where nothing can be
lost (the step-4 schedule notices, the "done" notice on
steps 1 and 4) and closes the flow the way that step's own exit does, since the
chat it opens sits behind the dialog; it is off beside the unsaved name and job
on steps 2-3, each such notice naming the draft. Its Create step is two
existing writes — `POST /api/agents` (the crewmate, job text stored as
`description`) and `POST /api/crons` with `member_id` naming the crewmate so the
schedule runs on the crewmate's own memory. Delivery is mechanical, never an
instruction to the model: the job is created non-`silent`, so every run rings
the dashboard bell and — when Slack is connected — reaches the owner's Slack DM
through the runtime's own leg (the flow's Slack row therefore only states that
fact; it is not a switch), and "Its own chat" maps to `hide_in_chat`, the one
delivery choice the runtime actually offers. The crewmate's identity is held
only from a clean create response -- the immutable `member_id` the server
allocates with its member memory, which `POST /api/agents` now returns beside
`memory_store` -- and it is the one thing the flow binds to or reconciles
against later; nothing is ever claimed by display NAME, because two
openings prefill the same example name and a same-named crewmate the flow
cannot prove it made is someone else's. So a 409 `agent_exists` is a taken name
on every attempt (step 2, error under the field, with a button to the Crew
Members page where that crewmate lives -- leaving dismisses the flow -- and the
suggestion chip carrying that name marked "already exists"), a create the server refused
(any other 4xx) says "could not be created" inline, and a create with no usable
answer (a dropped response, a 5xx) stops on step 3 with a block notice that the
crewmate "may or may not have been created", posts no schedule, and carries a
button to the Crewmates page (leaving completes the flow) so the user checks
before making a second one. The schedule is posted with `member_id` = that
identity, never the display name (a name is late-resolved on the server, so a
crewmate deleted and remade under the same name between the two writes would
otherwise receive the job; the identity resolves to exactly the crewmate just
made, or to nothing). A schedule write the server refused
(4xx) is reported as "not saved"; any other failure after the request left (a
dropped response, a 5xx) is reconciled against `GET /api/crons`, and only a job
that IS the one asked for counts -- `member_id` equal to the held identity, the
same name, the same message and the same schedule; an older or foreign job on
the crewmate is not evidence that this write landed -- so only when nothing matches, or that read fails, is it
reported as "may not have been saved", with a button to the Schedule page on
the notice (leaving completes the flow) rather than inviting a duplicate. "Only when I ask" posts no schedule and step 4 then
says nothing about reports or the Schedule page. An exit never waits for the
server: `onDone` closes the chapter at once and persists `crewmates_onboarded`
afterwards, because several exits navigate (`/members`, `/schedule`) and a
full-screen chapter gated on a round trip would cover the page the user just
asked for. A refused write is therefore shown where it can be: on the ready
step when the create-time write failed (the flow is still open), on the NEXT
entry when the write at exit failed (`persistFailed` carries it until a write
succeeds). A refusal marks NOTHING locally: `markCrewmatesOnboarded` applies the
render cache, the pending-mark clear and the in-memory flag only after the
server accepted the write, so this browser is still due the chapter after a
reload (which is what the notice says) instead of seeding a completion the
server never recorded; within the same session the flow does not auto-fire
again after it closed (the entry still opens it on demand). The flag is written
through `PUT /api/config/theme` the moment the crewmate exists (the flow stays
open for its ready step) and again when the user leaves.
The Crewmates page re-opens the flow on demand; that run sets the flag too.
`GET /api/theme/boot` exposes it beside the other first-run flags. The frontend
mirrors it in `localStorage['mc-crewmates-onboarded']` as a render cache only,
and — like `privacy_acked` — treats a workspace that was already `onboarded`
before this chapter existed as done locally (never persisted): an existing user
is not interrupted and reaches the flow from the Crewmates page, while a new
user, whose tour completes in the same session, flows straight on. A new user
who reloads or restarts BETWEEN the tour and this chapter is still due it: a
FIRST tour completion (`markOnboarded` while not yet onboarded -- a replay from
Settings by an existing user sets nothing) leaves `localStorage['mc-crewmates-pending']`
on that browser, the seed and the boot rule both exempt a workspace carrying the
mark from the "already onboarded counts as done" heuristic, and the mark is
cleared when the chapter is marked done. Only a workspace onboarded with no such
mark -- before this shipped, or from another machine -- is treated as an existing
install. The same rule keeps the E2E and capture harnesses, which seed only
`mc-onboarded`, clear of the chapter.

### `ChannelConfig.from_dict(data: dict) -> ChannelConfig`
Parses a channel config entry from JSON. Invalid activation values fall back to `"mention"`.

### `KiroCrewConfig.channel_config(channel_id: str) -> ChannelConfig`
Returns the effective config for a channel:
1. Explicit entry in `slack_channels` → returned as-is
2. DM channel (`D`-prefix) → `ChannelConfig(activation=slack_dm_activation)`
3. Group/public channel (`C`/`G`-prefix) → `ChannelConfig(activation="mention")`

```

The `dashboard.url` field supplies the browser-facing/reverse-proxy origin and,
when present, a candidate port; its origin is added to the CSRF/WebSocket allowlist.
It does **not** widen the TCP bind in the public build, which remains
`127.0.0.1` unless the operator explicitly sets `KIROCREW_BIND` to an IP address
(for example inside a container). When omitted, the dashboard defaults to
`localhost:5476`.

A **malformed** `dashboard.url` (e.g. an unterminated IPv6 literal `http://[::1` or a non-numeric port `http://host:notaport`) does **not** abort startup: `parse_dashboard_url` degrades to the defaults (`""` host, port `5476`) and logs a warning, so a single typo in the config can never take the gateway down on boot. `KIROCREW_PORT` still overrides the port regardless.

The moment the dashboard's port is **reserved** (bound and listening, not yet
accepting — before any app backend spawns), the gateway **exports the
actually-bound port as `KIROCREW_BOUND_PORT`** into its own environment, so
every child it spawns (kiro-cli sessions and their MCP stdio servers) inherits
the truth instead of re-deriving a guess from `dashboard.url` — a portless URL
would otherwise collapse to the default port in the child even when the
gateway is bound elsewhere (including `--port auto`, where the OS assigns the
port and no config field ever names it). It is a **distinct variable from
`KIROCREW_PORT`** on purpose: `KIROCREW_PORT` means operator intent and is
persisted by `service_environment()` into unit files, while
`KIROCREW_BOUND_PORT` is ephemeral observed truth that must never be frozen
into persistent config. Clients read it via `port_resolution.resolve_client_port`,
one precedence step below the operator override.

## Model Resolution Chain

When `agent.model` is `"auto"` (default):

1. `~/.kiro/agents/kirocrew.json` → `model` field (installed agent config)
2. `config_package_dir()/defaults.json` → `model` field (bundled `src/kiro_crew/config/defaults.json`)
3. Falls back to `DEFAULT_MODEL` (passed through to provider)

## Load-time Error Handling

These rules apply to `KiroCrewConfig.load()`; mutation helpers fail closed on a
corrupt existing document as described above.

- Missing file → defaults
- Invalid JSON → defaults (warning logged)
- Missing fields → individual defaults

### Default context discovery

`skills.max_triggered=0` disables per-message trigger injection, not discovery.
The default entry (`lazy_load=true`) is a bounded usage-ranked index carrying each
skill's path, and one line naming the families it leaves out. An install last
written by 0.6.x or earlier has its materialized `false` removed once on upgrade
(see "The legacy `skills.lazy_load` rewrite"). `lazy_load=false`
selects the shorter entry: up to eight names (up to six of them the user's own
skills, the rest the highest-ranked remaining skills) with short purposes plus
`skill_search` guidance for short keywords. An agent with its own `skill://`
mapping gets neither -- those skills arrive as complete instructions. Both preserve pinned instructions, confined project-body
limits and explicit loading. Thread history scales with the model window
independently of the fixed old-activity allowance; no additional config switches
are introduced. The model window also derives the non-configurable protected-content
safety ceiling: `max(3 * 33,000, floor(window_tokens * 4.0 * 0.125))` characters.
Crossing it omits complete lesson entries first and reports their count; preferences,
safety rules, and date/runtime identity stay whole. This does not change the fixed
33,000-character optional-content allowance.
