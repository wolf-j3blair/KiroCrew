# Session Manager Module

## Overview

Maps thread keys to LLMProvider instances (`session.py`). Each thread gets
its own kiro-cli session with idle expiry, context compaction, circuit
breaker, per-session semaphore, and persistent background session.

Chat sessions are served from the warm pool when eligible (default pool
agent, default cwd, no resume mapping); otherwise they cold-start on first
message via `get_or_create()`.

Successful native ACP resume suppresses replay from both disk and the
dashboard's live slot window. The runner honors the actual provider client's
resumed state as well as the SessionManager result. A real cold start uses the
canonical merged replay; an explicit reset suppresses that replay instead of
silently reloading a fallback. The current request is delivered once and is not
replayed as historical input. This includes cron, recovery and user-replay
injections; queue drain supplies the exact appended row to the runner.

`running` gates turn admission and destructive history edits; `turn_running`
reports execution. `running` also reads `_turn_admission_reserved`, which the
dashboard send handler sets for a person's own send between admitting the row
and publishing `slot.task`, the window that holds the automatic Slack link
(`chat_slack.maybe_auto_link_slack`, at most `AUTO_LINK_HOLD_SECS`), so a second
send arriving in that window takes the queue path instead of dispatching a
second turn; the handler's busy branch reads the same flag, and a `finally`
clears it on every path out of the window. A Stop pressed in that window has no
task to cancel, so the handler reads `_stop_generation` across the hold and does
not dispatch the stopped turn; a send queued behind it in that window starts
then, as it would at the end of a stopped turn. `test_slot_running_readers.py::test_running_and_turn_running_slot_readers_are_enumerated`
walks every dashboard symbol and pins each direct or shared-helper reader by
`(module, symbol)` to the predicate it uses; the same census enumerates every
non-null `slot.task` publisher so a new unguarded admission site fails the test.

Continue and Project requests retain the slot object they originally authorized.
They reject a same-name replacement after lock acquisition and each pre-commit
suspension: Continue's child probe, and Project's body read, workspace validation
and recent-project save. A refused save rolls back only its own project token
and cannot arm a deferred reset or eager spawn for the replacement.

## Dashboard app launch intents

The split-session picker's recency tie-break and artifact companion selection
compare `last_activity_ts` as an instant, preserving sub-millisecond transcript
precision. Needs-input and running sessions retain their picker priority.
Missing or unparseable activity sorts last. Legacy naive timestamps resolve in
the viewer's timezone; a viewer in another zone cannot recover the writer's
timezone from this payload.

The App SDK's `slotKey` selects an existing dashboard slot through ordinary
activation on both cold entry and navigation within an already-mounted chat.
The session controller claims the target intent before URL synchronization and
releases its message only after a fulfilled `switchSlot`. Slow activation does
not expire a claimed message; failure shows the existing session-open error
with the unsent message available to copy and never sends to a fallback. A routed
chat waits for that exact target before using the message; an embedded chat never
consumes the dashboard intent.
`window.__mc_chat_launch` is claimed once: the session controller owns explicit
targets and fresh drafts; `ChatPage` owns untargeted automatic sends
(`useAppLaunchIntake`, `website/src/pages/chat/page/launchIntake.ts`). Unclaimed
intents expire after ten seconds. A newer intent supersedes a pending target
by ref identity, so its later completion cannot release the older message.
`autoSend: false` seeds
an unsent draft, appending to existing text when the target already has a draft.
Without a target, the existing new-session controller creates
one session and stages the draft before navigation, retaining it on creation
failure for retry. Agent selection applies to new sessions only. These options
do not attach app task metadata or change backend session authorization.
App auto-send uses only the supplied text, leaving staged files, pasted content,
knowledge and session references untouched. Existing composer sends and legacy
URL auto-send retain their prior behavior. Refused app turns and failed app
session creation keep their text in the page-level copyable error notice, not
an unrelated draft. Recovery adds no user row to a busy slot. That notice survives slot changes
but is not persisted across page unmounts. Creation failure does not re-arm a
new-session intent for the next manual send.

## Dashboard chat state

The dashboard holds every open session's chat state in one Redux slice, `chat`.
`website/src/store/chatSlice.ts` is its only `createSlice` call and the one path
consumers import it through: every action creator, thunk, selector, constant and
type resolves there, and every action type stays `chat/<name>`. The facade
composes owners under `website/src/store/chat/`, and the dependency runs one
way: no owner imports the facade, and no module in `website/src`,
`website/integration` or `website/capture` outside `website/src/store` imports
an owner (`website/src/store/chatSlice.ownership.test.ts`).

| Owner | What it owns for a slot |
|---|---|
| `website/src/store/chat/state.ts` | `ChatState`, its initial value, and the persisted `mc-activity-open:<slot>` key family |
| `website/src/store/chat/wire.ts` | the trust boundary: the `__proto__` / `constructor` / `prototype` key guards and the slot-detail read with its normalization |
| `website/src/store/chat/runState.ts` | the active-slot handover, running / stopping state, the turn-start epoch, and the navigation MRU |
| `website/src/store/chat/slotSwitch.ts` | `switchSlot`: the bounded slot-detail read, the atomic handover, the unwind when the target is gone, and the pane notice a failed gesture raises |
| `website/src/store/chat/slotRefresh.ts` | `refreshSlot` and `warmSlotCache`, the re-reads that do not switch |
| `website/src/store/chat/lifecycle.ts` | `createSlot`, `forkSlot`, `resumeFromHistory`, `fetchHistory` and `deleteHistorySession`, with the notices a failed attempt leaves |
| `website/src/store/chat/slotResidue.ts` | teardown of slots that left the authoritative list, and the one list of per-slot maps every teardown clears |
| `website/src/store/chat/activity.ts` | the activity panel and live tool log: the slot's tab and persisted open state, the inline tool-focus signal, and the tool-call / approval / tool-result frames that fill the log |
| `website/src/store/chat/composerCards.ts` | the cards above the composer, one per slot: the question card, follow-up suggestions and the folder suggestion |
| `website/src/store/chat/automations.ts` | monitor and goal-loop automations per slot, reconciled from the REST snapshots and upserted from live frames |
| `website/src/store/chat/workflows.ts` | live dynamic-workflow runs, their reconcile against the authoritative run list, and the sidebar's per-session activity selectors |
| `website/src/store/chat/selectors.ts` | slot-scoped reads, the composer's busy rule, the Continue predicate that mirrors `_has_conversation` in `dashboard/chat_handlers.py`, and the Resume predicate that mirrors `is_turn_interrupted` in `dashboard/state.py` |

The facade keeps three constructs that a read-only check reads from this file:
the live `chat_message` frame reducer with the question-retiring role set and the
chunk-gap marker (`test/test_slot_needs_input_status.py` and the i18n ledger),
`deleteSlot` with the one `dispatch(switchSlot(` site the call-site oracle counts
here, and `loadOlderMessages` with the slot capture `chatPins.test.tsx` reads.
`requestStop` stays too, because it dispatches this slice's own actions. The
transcript-window and
history-cache owners are listed in
[history](history.md#the-dashboard-transcript-window-frontend); Side Chat,
sub-agent and MCP App state in [side](side.md), [subagent](subagent.md) and
[mcp-apps](mcp-apps.md).

## Implementation Boundaries

`SessionManager` remains the compatibility facade in `session.py`; callers keep
using its existing public, import, and monkeypatch seams. Mutable policy and
state are composed behind that facade:

- `session_allocation.py` — live registry, key folding, semaphore leases,
  cold-start allocation, claims, and companion runtimes
- `session_pool.py` — warm-provider spawn, inventory, claim, health, and discard
- `session_background.py` — persistent and multiplexed background runtimes
- `session_compaction.py` — context gates, compaction execution, verdicts,
  cooldowns, and guarded escalation
- `session_lifecycle.py` — refresh/reload, reset/remove/destroy/discard,
  identity retirement, stop, drain, and close ordering
- `session_cleanup.py` — cleanup-task state, watchdog hooks, idle/RSS/stuck-turn
  policy, and process/filesystem sweeps

A dashboard slot bound to a remote crew keeps one memory boundary on both sides.
`remote_relay.create_peer_slot()` always includes the validated `memory_mode` in
the peer's `POST /api/chat/slots` payload, while agent and model remain sparse
explicit picks. Omitting the mode would let a local Incognito or Temporary row
execute as Persistent on the peer and read or write memory the user disabled.

A slot ADOPTED from a peer row (`POST /api/chat/slots` with `adopt_remote_slot`)
inherits `agent`, `title`, `memory_mode` and `workspace` from that row
(`remote_adopt.peer_row_metadata()`). `workspace` is a mirror of the value the
peer committed for the session it runs, the same value the forwarded
agent/workspace picks write back into the field afterwards, so the projection
and the persisted record name the workspace the turns actually run in rather
than this machine's create default. It is not a local binding: the peer-bound
create skips this machine's agent-binding resolution, `default_project_dir` is
still fed the local default (so `project` and `memory_store` never resolve from
a peer's name), and the relay hands every turn to the peer before the local turn
path reads the field. Every control in `remote_relay._PEER_CONTROL_SEGMENTS` is
classified in `remote_adopt.ADOPT_SEEDED_CONTROLS` / `ADOPT_UNSEEDED_CONTROLS`,
and a structural test fails for a new forwardable control until it is placed.

Cross-boundary calls that were observable on `SessionManager` route back through
the facade, and patchable module dependencies are resolved through injected
call-time functions. Persistence remains owned by the existing `SessionMap`
contract; this decomposition does not change its stored format.

The owner protocols and forwarding dependency adapters are transitional
compatibility boundaries, not extension points. New internal behavior belongs
on the service that owns its state; widen a protocol or adapter only when an
existing facade/import/monkeypatch seam requires it. Individual adapters may be
retired in follow-up changes after repository-wide callers and characterization
tests have moved off the corresponding legacy seam.

## Agent selection provenance

Each session owns one canonical `execution_context` in its ordinary metadata.
The frozen record binds `member_id` (or explicit Global/V1), `MemoryStoreRef`,
member/template namespace, provider template, privacy mode and app attribution.
A configured member has an immutable persisted ID independent of its editable
label. Templates, projects and display names cannot select member memory.
Discovery of a same-named member cannot reinterpret an existing template session.
Resolved dispatch bindings use the canonical `default` name for Global memory,
including when restored from a captured execution record. Equivalent aliases
therefore compare equally without changing the selected conversation identity.

Admission captures the record before asynchronous work and passes it directly to
provider allocation and prompt construction. Automatic selection publication
compares the captured record; an explicit concurrent choice wins over delayed
preparation. Rollback compares only the record this operation published, including
live restricted-session records. Slot/session locks, drained cancellation,
ordinary owner/app permissions and governance remain in force. A malformed or
missing member carrier reports memory unavailable and never chooses Global.
Existing ordinary V1 sessions retain their V1 behavior; old V2 grants are not
migrated or used as a second authority.

One record shape is backfilled instead of refused: a persistent session written
before the field existed (0.7.0.5), carrying `agent` and a `memory_store` that
names a declared V2 store but no `execution_context`. `read_session_execution`
derives the carrier from the store's `owner_member_id` only when that id names
exactly one configured member, that member resolves to the same store, and the
record's `agent` names that member by alias or id; it then writes the carrier
into the record with a compare-and-set against the exact legacy shape it read,
so every later read decodes it like any other session. The derived identity is
never vouched -- the store came from the session's own record -- so the session
stands where a member session stands after a restart. A record with no `agent`,
an `agent` naming anyone else, an explicit template pick, a store the
start-of-process migration could not attribute, a `member_id` marker, or a
restricted mode is left unchanged and still refused, and the refusal names the
remedy that works for that store: open a new chat with the same member (or
archive this one) when the store has an attributed owner, or the legacy store
repair `kirocrew doctor` names when the start-of-process migration could not
attribute it. A successful backfill logs one INFO line naming the session.

Persistent sessions serialize this record in their existing owner metadata.
Incognito and Temporary sessions keep it in live session state only. Their
TRANSCRIPT is persisted like any other session's -- the user reopens an
incognito or temporary chat from History, before or after a restart -- and what
the mode withholds is everything derived FROM it: consolidation, lessons,
memory injection, the session summary, workflow and task snapshots. The
metadata line is the file's privacy contract, and both slot save and
turn-start binding treat it as a ratchet. When a writer tightens a line held by a
live slot, the slot follows that mode on the event loop and its restricted-key
marker is re-derived, so export, summary, memory injection, and learning gates
observe the same restriction. Transcript-derived durable and egress publication
then revalidates the chained live lines through `ConversationLog.publication_hold`.
Export and transfer pass the exact chain returned with their assembled rows, so
any membership change before publication is retryable. Export commits its
synchronous response under the hold, while transfer releases it immediately
before its awaited tunnel send. The network transmit is the accepted residual
window; no threading lock crosses an await. The binder folds a
carrier-less line's canonical
on-disk mode into a new execution before choosing its publication branch, so a
persistent same-key replacement takes the live-only restricted branch and cannot
write an owner store onto that line. When a live carrier already exists, the
turn-start read-back reads the metadata line off-loop, folds its mode into that
carrier, and republishes only the stricter carrier before memory context is built;
an unreadable line is a transient read failure, not a mode -- the fold is withheld
for that turn and the next turn's read-back tries again, since every mode the fold
publishes is a one-way ratchet no path can widen -- while an absent line adds no
mode.
The slot save likewise records the STRICTEST
mode it can see (the slot's own, or the live carrier's when the two disagree for
a moment), never a looser one. Incognito may read memory;
Temporary does not. Both refuse learned-memory writes. Children inherit the
strictest admitted mode, even after a parent closes; replacing a parent cannot
broaden their policy. If an existing persistent session becomes restricted, its
existing owner record atomically tightens only retention metadata, and restart
cannot recover a weaker mode. A new restricted session does not create a durable
owner record, and its metadata line names NO `memory_store`: with no carrier on
the line, a store name would read back as the legacy owner claim the identity
backfill refuses for a restricted mode, and the restart would refuse the chat.
Left out, the restart reads the session as unbound and the first turn re-selects
the member from `agent` under the retained mode -- the same live-only carrier the
session ran under before the restart. Because `agent` is a mutable alias, a DM
re-selection must prove the chat still runs as the member it ran before: a DM
slot KEY encodes the member's immutable id (the metadata line is agent-writable
and is never an identity source), so a DM re-selection whose resolved id differs
from that encoded id is refused -- the thread belongs to a specific member and
the alias now names another; the member's memory stays intact and a new
conversation binds it cleanly. `agent_kind` stays on the line: it is a
display fact, not an owner claim.

Tab close and idle archival snapshot the live restricted identity before yielding;
cleanup does not read durable session metadata. Tab close retires its nudge loop
before other asynchronous work. After the last consumer and provider stop, cleanup
releases only the captured identity, preserving any replacement session carrier.

## Private member session ownership

The section name is retained for existing documentation links. Member memory is
application routing, not a confidentiality boundary against arbitrary code under
the same OS user. There is no separate protected session/run grant, memory PID
ancestry database, member HMAC capability, namespace mount or Seatbelt memory rule.
Ordinary transport authentication, owner/app permissions, audit integrity,
credential redaction and the host sandbox remain independent requirements.

The member and store in an admitted session stay fixed. An explicit provider
switch may change a template only through the session selection path; it cannot
select another member store. A new member choice opens a new conversation where
required by the dashboard ownership contract. Restoring history restores its
canonical record, rather than resolving the latest display alias or project.
Cron, workflow and subagent owners carry the same record in their own durable
state so they do not depend on the lifetime of an originating chat.

Permanent rules, briefing and profile documents are read directly using stable
member identity. They remain available when the learned database is unavailable.
Normal member prompts do not inject learned/core rows; explicit recall reports
an unavailable or mismatched database without falling back to Global.

Essential-context receipts belong to the serving provider, not a shared builder
or logical key. Inner client, native session ID and process-instance identity
prevent replacement providers from inheriting receipts. Compaction invalidates
receipts and late pre-compaction completions cannot restore them. Fresh/resumed
member lifecycle rules still control reinjection. Member prompt documents are
prepared before process launch; a warm runtime prepared without them is bypassed.

## Member capability generations

Enrolled members prepare capabilities only when allocating a new runtime.
`session_capabilities.prepare_runtime` reconciles ordinary Parent updates and
verifies the saved materialization off-loop before provider construction. It
passes the immutable template explicitly while preserving the canonical member,
member memory binding, history key, caller model and approval policy. An explicit
or resumed cwd wins; otherwise the member's configured workspace is used. A cwd
that disagrees with the saved Parent identity refuses startup.
When no caller model is supplied, allocation resolves the member's model pin by
its canonical alias, including members that have not enrolled capabilities. The id
it hands the provider is stamped on the registered session, because the allocation
returns only the provider and its first-turn observation: a caller recording what
the session was asked to run reads that stamp
(`SessionManager.allocation_requested_model`) rather than resolving a second time,
so the id sent and the id recorded are one value. An empty stamp means the
allocation resolved nothing, or that a registration site which resolves no models
made the session.

Enrolled allocations bypass warm and shared processes. Full-spec loading is
supported by the dedicated Kiro backend; other harnesses refuse explicitly rather
than falling back to the default agent. A successful mode handshake, fresh process
instance, live session id, and post-start saved-byte/ownership/governance checks
are all required before `_Session.loaded_capabilities` is stamped. MCP hot reload
is not evidence that prompt, resources and the rest of the spec were loaded.
The applied view also checks that each enabled MCP connection in that saved
version has reported ready through the provider's own MCP report. Missing reports
remain unverified, authentication requests remain pending, and initialization
failures or unresolved tool refs report failure. Later ready reports can clear
that state without restarting the conversation; raw provider errors are not
included in capability status responses.

`SessionManager.capability_runtime_view(member, saved_revision)` delegates to
`SessionAllocationService`, which projects its owned `SessionRegistryState` on
the event loop through `session_capabilities.runtime_view`. The projection reads
live occupants and failed allocations from that same state and returns fresh
response rows, never mutable registry dictionaries. Dashboard handlers do not
access the manager's private registries. Old live sessions report pending and keep
their current turn and context; saving never resets them or requests history
replay. A changed process, handle, active template or governance generation removes
the applied claim. Replacing a provider clears its stamp. Failed starts leave a
bounded retryable diagnostic; a successful retry replaces it with the real session.
The owner capabilities GET and PUT handlers call this helper on the event loop
for the saved revision. Preview never claims runtime adoption. A failed saved-byte
or source validation remains failed even if an older provider is still alive;
persistence alone cannot claim application.

## Background Session

`BACKGROUND_KEY = "_bg"` is a persistent shared session for lightweight
background work. It is:

- **Created on startup** by `start_pool()` alongside the warm pool. Before the
  provider factory runs, `_ensure_background` awaits
  `agent_discovery.warm_agent_specs()` (one `parsed_agent_specs` parse on
  `mc-discovery`, never raises) so the factory's synchronous, on-loop model lookup
  finds a warm snapshot and `_bg` is created on its agent's own pin rather than on
  `agent.model`; the lookup itself touches no file on the loop (see
  `_resolve_named_agent_model` in `config.md`)
- **Never expired** by idle cleanup (`_expire_idle` skips it)
- **Serialized** by the per-session semaphore (one background task at a time)
  — applies to the **non-kiro** `_bg` path only; see "Multiplexed _bg runtime"
- **Shared by**: heartbeat tasks, lesson extraction (NOT cron — see below)

This eliminates the cost of spawning/tearing down a kiro-cli process for
every cron job or heartbeat tick. Background tasks acquire the semaphore,
do their work, and release — the process stays warm.

### Context Overflow Protection

`recycle_background()` is called after every background task completes.
It checks context usage and **recycles** (kill + fresh spawn) the session
if needed — no compaction, since background tasks are stateless:

- At ≥ 70% context → recycle (same threshold as chat's default compaction)
- A reported 0% that the provider flags as *unknown* (`context_usage_unknown` —
  the backend compacted in place) → recycle
- After 40 prompts (`_BG_BLIND_RECYCLE_PROMPTS`) → recycle (blind backstop).
  This backstop is **not** gated on the reported percentage: background turns are
  tiny text prompts that never approach 70%, so keying it on "the backend reports
  no metadata" retired it permanently as soon as any real percentage was read,
  leaving the provider with no lifetime bound for the whole gateway uptime.
  `recycle_background()` counts the turn itself (`check_context_usage` is a
  chat-turn hook and never advances `_bg`), and the log names the backstop rather
  than the percentage that did not trigger it.
- Process-tree RSS at or over `session.watchdog_rss_max_mb` → recycle. When
  that knob is 0 (its default, which turns the chat-session sweep off) the
  ceiling is `BACKGROUND_RSS_FALLBACK_MB` (1536 MiB), so this runtime stays
  bounded either way.
- Below thresholds → no-op (session stays warm)

Callers: heartbeat callback, taskrunner lesson extraction.

### Multiplexed _bg runtime

`get_bg_session()` acquires a `_bg` handle, dispatching by `agent.acp_backend`
and returning `AcpSessionHandle | _ProviderBgSession`. Dispatch is via
`_bg_backend_supports_runtime()` — positive membership in
`_bg_runtime_backends()` — the intersection of `ACP_BACKENDS_ACP_RUNTIME`,
`ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_EVICTION` and `selectable_backends()` — never an
inequality (harness parity). The selectability term is defense-in-depth: a
runtime-capable harness that is not operator-selectable must not be spawnable
here from a config object that skipped the loader's normalisation.

The eviction term is what decides whether a harness that runs on the shared
runtime may also serve this path. Background handles are the high-churn ones —
title generation, suggestions, folders and nav each take their own ephemeral
`sessionId`, many per conversation, at a rate the user never controls — so a
teardown that does not evict is unbounded growth here. Membership in
`ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_EVICTION` is the claim that the teardown verb Crew sends
actually frees one session, and it is earned by measurement. Codex is a member
on that basis: its teardown is the standard `session/close` sent as a request,
after which the same `sessionId` no longer answers `session/set_config_option`
(measured live against codex-acp 1.11.0). It was excluded for as long as the
verb Crew sent was `session/cancel`, after which the session kept answering and
a further `session/prompt`'s `cachedReadTokens` showed the context resident —
`cancel` interrupts a turn, it does not end a session. The delivery is part of
the fact: the same `close` sent as a notification is ignored and evicts
nothing, which is why the harness declares `notification=False` and why a gated
live test re-measures both on every install with the adapter.

The background path is not the only reader. `AcpSessionProvider.new_conversation`
— the warm-reset primitive the workflow pool reaches for — reads the same set,
because the whole reason that path is cheap is that `old.destroy()` reclaims the
previous session on the already-running process. On a non-evicting harness that
call frees nothing, so each pool reset would leave one more resident session, and
here the "person opens chats" bound does not apply: a pooled workflow resets at
whatever rate its steps run. Nor can a recycle rule be relied on to rescue it,
because a rule that measures a narrower scope than where the sessions live
never sees the growth, leaving the age ceiling as the only reaper. So a
non-evicting backend is REFUSED there before any session is created, and
`WorkerPool.reset` takes its existing hard-reset fallback — slower, and correct
for every harness. Refusing before the `session/new` rather than after is the
whole point: creating first would leak exactly the session the refusal exists to
prevent.

- **runtime-capable backend** (`_bg_runtime_backends()`) — each caller (title
  generation, suggestions, folders, nav) gets its **own** ephemeral `sessionId`
  multiplexed on a single shared `_bg_runtime` (an `AcpRuntime` spawned under
  the CONFIGURED backend), created lazily under `_bg_runtime_lock`.
  `create_session()` runs **outside** the lock so independent callers aren't
  serialized. The runtime is respawned-and-retried once on `AcpRuntimeDead`
  (`max_retries=1`, 2 attempts total).
- **any other backend** — falls back to a `_ProviderBgSession` over the shared
  `BACKGROUND_KEY` `_Session`, serialized by its `Semaphore(1)`. In the public
  Kiro Crew edition `agent.provider` is fixed to `acp` and only kiro and KAS are
  selectable, so this branch is the dormant fallback for the reserved
  `ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE` seam only.

Two conditions displace the cached `_bg_runtime`: a **backend switch** and
**staleness** (`AcpRuntime._is_stale()` → `"age"` past 6h, or `"rss"` past
500 MiB across the descendant tree; on macOS each pid of that tree is measured
by its `phys_footprint`, falling back to its `ps` RSS, because `ps` RSS omits the
compressed and swapped pages an idle grown runtime mostly consists of). The displacement policy has ONE
implementation, `_detach_bg_runtime_locked(runtime, cause, *, park_only=False)`:
the runtime is
killed if idle, and **parked on `_draining_bg_runtimes` if it has live or
initializing handles** — parked runtimes never receive a new session (only
`_bg_runtime` is offered to callers), their in-flight work finishes untouched
(killing mid-turn would abort an in-flight title generation), and
`_reap_drained_bg_runtimes_locked()` kills each once its last handle drains.
Either way the slot is freed in the same lock hold that spawns the replacement,
so the very next background call runs on a fresh process even while the old one
is still draining. `cause` is threaded into every log line the displacement
emits, because a staleness recycle and a backend flap have different remedies
and must not read alike.

Two paths reach it. The backend-switch adapter
`_displace_bg_runtime_locked(runtime, cached_backend, configured_backend)` is
called from `_retire_stale_backend_bg_runtime()` and from the `acp_backend`
mismatch check inside `get_bg_session()`'s runtime branch (the mismatch outranks
staleness). The staleness probe sits in that same branch and is run on **every**
eligible runtime, busy or idle, using the full `_is_stale()` predicate rather
than the cheap age-only `_stale_by_age()`: waiting for a zero-session window is
not a bound, since a multiplexed runtime under sustained background load never
has one, and RSS — not age — was the growth mode observed (multi-GB over ~24h).
The cost of probing the busy path too is that `_bg_runtime_lock` is now held
across `_is_stale()`'s offloaded RSS read for busy runtimes as well; that is
bounded by `_RSS_PROBE_MIN_AGE_SECS` (5 min), below which the probe returns
without any executor round-trip, and a runtime that answers "stale" is displaced
rather than re-probed. `_draining_bg_runtimes` has **no cap** — a retiree whose
handles never drain stays parked and sweep-shielded — so the
`%d _bg runtimes are parked draining` warning is the signal that displacement is
outpacing the drain.

Parked runtimes stay shielded from the orphan-PID sweep
(`_companion_runtime_pids`), block the account-identity sweep's completeness
(`_retire_kiro_bg_runtime`) while they drain, and are reaped by a periodic
watchdog hook (`bg_drain_reap`) as the backstop for an idle gateway where no
other trigger runs.

That same hook carries the **idle-staleness sweep**,
`reap_idle_stale_bg_runtime()`, and it is not housekeeping. Both displacement
triggers above live on the REUSE path in `get_bg_session()`, and the shared
runtime's pid is sweep-shielded for its whole life, so a runtime that stops being
reused is never asked `_is_stale()` again and is reaped by nothing else: it lives
until the gateway restarts. Measured on an operator host: 11 agent runtimes
holding 6.0 GB, six of them 14.5 h old and five of those over the 500 MiB
ceiling, against 4 live slots. The sweep asks the question off the reuse path,
under `_bg_runtime_lock`, and retires only a runtime with NO active or
initializing session.

It PARKS rather than kills, through `_detach_bg_runtime_locked(..., park_only=True)`,
and that flag exists for one reason: `get_bg_session()` pins the runtime under
the lock, RELEASES the lock, and only then calls `create_session`, which is where
`_session_inits_in_flight` rises. A kill inside that window surfaces as
`AcpRuntimeDead` on a caller that did nothing wrong; parking cannot, because the
drain reaper re-probes on a later tick, by which time the pinned start has either
registered (busy — it stays parked) or failed. The slot is re-read after the
awaited staleness probe, so a concurrent displacement that replaced it is never
acted on with the old reading. Both probes fail toward PRESERVING the runtime: a
session or staleness probe that raises retires nothing.

`close_all()` detaches both holders atomically under
`_bg_runtime_lock` and kills the detached snapshot; its counterpart `_closing`
gate in `get_bg_session()` — and in the idle-staleness sweep — refuses to spawn
or park once shutdown has started.
Note there is currently no dashboard edit surface for
`agent.acp_backend`, but a file or CLI edit does not wait for the next gateway
start: the config watcher dispatches it as a `_FACTORY_CONFIG_PATHS` change, so
`refresh_defaults()` rebuilds the factory and retires stale-backend background
runtimes on the write. A future edit surface gets retirement for free
by routing through it like the other `agent.*` defaults. The provider-path
retirement trigger is dormant in the public edition for the same reason the
`ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE` branch is: every selectable backend is runtime-capable.

Both paths yield `AcpEvent` through the shared
`acp/_dispatch.parse_session_update` parser, so there is no behavioral drift
between them. Callers **MUST** call `session.destroy()` in a `finally` block
when done. See [acp-client.md](acp-client.md) for `AcpRuntime` /
`AcpSessionHandle`.

**Cheapest-model bg tasks**: the categorical/classification background tasks
(folder-icon `chat_folders.py`, link-summary `chat_nav.py`, session title
`chat_title.py`, session-summary `handlers/sessions.py`, STT endpointing
`stt_stream.py`, and the lesson-contradiction check `dashboard/handlers/cron.py`,
plus tips generation) express a `"auto"` model preference and pass it to a
best-effort per-session `set_model`. The wire chokepoint
(`AcpSessionHandle.set_model` → `resolve_usable_model`) mirrors the interactive
`_wire_model_id`: it sends a served id (a persisted pin carrying a stale
`<namespace>::` qualifier is folded to the advertised spelling via
`resolve_pin_spelling`), sends `"auto"` only when the backend
advertises it, and for anything else — `"auto"` where a partition doesn't serve
it, or an unentitled concrete id — resolves to `""` and **skips the
send**, inheriting the session's served backend default. So these tasks never
put an unserved model or a literal unavailable `"auto"` on the wire (which would
fail with `Invalid model ID`). A reactive retry in `run_bg_oneliner`
(retry once with the first advertised model on a mid-prompt rejection) remains a
thin backstop for the fail-open case where the advertised set was unknown at
send time.

## Account-identity retirement (identity sweep)

A kiro-backed child authenticates from the CLI credential store as its process
starts and keeps that account for life, so an out-of-band account switch or
logout leaves running children answering turns on the previous account. The
retirement machinery detects and recycles them, in `session_lifecycle.py`
(`retire_kiro_identity_sessions`) driven by the per-turn gate in
`chat_runner.py`, against baselines owned by `KiroPrerequisiteService`.

**Identity fingerprint** (`current_identity_fingerprint`): one string over
every credential source a child may have loaded, each kept as its OWN
component so a failed read drops a component rather than changing one: the
kiro-cli store's hashed stable claims, then `+key:<sha256>` for Kiro CLI's own
`KIRO_API_KEY` (read from the environment, falling back to the data home's
`.env`, as the `whoami` probe does), then `+crew:<digest>` for the Crew vault.
The key and vault components appear only when present, so a host with neither
fingerprints exactly as the store alone. An API-key host keeps no identity row
in the store, and without the key component it read as signed out on every
turn — every dashboard send retired idle sessions and cancelled their
`spawn_run` children (#15126). The key joins only a DEFINITIVE store answer
(read and audited with every credential row identified, or no store file at
all): after an unauditable, unreadable or relocated store read, or one that
found a login no stable claim identifies (a social login), only the key
component is withheld and the fingerprint is exactly what it was before the key
was counted, because a harness that strips the key (KAS) authenticates from the
store, and a key-only baseline would let a store account switch compare equal.
A child whose per-session env overlay (`extra_env`, e.g. a cron job's `env`
block) names `KIRO_API_KEY` is never spawn-stamped and never spared by the
sweep: the fingerprint reads the gateway's credentials, and that child may have
authenticated as a different account. A spawn stamp proves a wrong account only
through its store or vault component, never its key component: a harness that
strips the key (KAS) is unaffected by a key rotation, which the ordinary
baseline comparison still reports.
**Boot-seeded baseline** (`seed_sessions_baseline`): the running-children
baseline is adopted from the store at gateway startup, before anything can
spawn a kiro-backed child, so every child postdates the read. This removes the
once-per-lifetime unset-baseline sweep, whose completion precondition (nothing
busy, nothing mid-start) is routinely unsatisfiable on a live gateway —
retired idle sessions are eagerly respawned by dashboard slots, the next sweep
reads incomplete, and the baseline never advances, recycling healthy children
forever. The seed refuses (keeping the fail-safe sweep) under `assume_ready`,
when a baseline is already recorded, when the identity cannot be fingerprinted
(an unreadable store with no API key, or any store read that is not definitive),
and when the read hangs past a 5s bound.

**Interim latch** (`_maybe_latch_interim_identity`): a bare baseline
comparison is blind to an A→B→A round trip, so any fresh read (status polls,
turn gates, probes) that observes a different account than the baseline arms a
sticky flag forcing the next turn gate to sweep even after the store switches
back. Observations that could be transient read failures refuse to latch —
component LOSS is indistinguishable from a blip, while a component that
appears or changes cannot be one — so an unreadable store can never arm it.
Each qualifying observation also bumps an observation GENERATION; the gate
captures the generation right after its initiating read and hands it back at
reconcile (`note_sessions_reconciled(live, observations_before=...)`), which
keeps the latch armed when a newer observation exists: that account was
observed after the sweep's coverage, and a child spawned under it may be
unstamped and otherwise invisible.

**Spawn-identity stamps**: every spawn site bracket-reads the store
immediately before `start()` and after, and records the account on the
provider (or the shared `AcpRuntime` for demuxed sessions) only when both
reads agree — a disagreement or failed read refuses the stamp, and either read
observing an interim account feeds the latch. Stamps are first-stamp-wins (a
warm-pool provider keeps its fill-time record), the stamp read is shielded
from orphan cleanup by `_starting_pids`, and every stamp await sits under a
teardown guard so cancellation cannot leak a started child. An unstamped
child keeps exactly the pre-stamping protections.

**Live-account spare** (`spawned_under`, inside the sweep): a session or
companion runtime whose spawn stamp EQUALS the live fingerprint — the whole
fingerprint, every component — provably authenticated as the live account and
is skipped by `retire_kiro_identity_sessions`: not retired, not flagged, and
not counted against completeness (the runtime reapers take the fingerprint as
`live=` and apply the same test to their post-conditions). For a child that
never received `KIRO_API_KEY` (KAS and every foreign backend strip it at
spawn) the key component is left out of that comparison, so a key rotation
does not retire its idle parent and cancel its running children. Without it the
sweep retired every kiro-backed idle session and could complete only when
every kiro-backed holder was idle at once, which a busy gateway never is:
each turn re-swept, and an idle parent whose `spawn_run` children were still
running was retired with them — every subagent on the host died as
`AcpProcessDied ... (provider shutdown)` on every turn any chat took
(#14605). The spare is the strict converse of the mismatch gate: a mismatch
is proven component-wise (a read can only LOSE components), a spare needs
exact equality, an unstamped child is never spared, and an empty live
fingerprint (unreadable store, and the sign-out path, which sweeps with no
fingerprint on purpose) spares nothing. The sweep's release is pinned to the
runtime it inspected (`release_subagent_runtime(key, expected=runtime)`): it
decides from a snapshot and then waits for the per-parent spawn lock, and a
respawn holding that lock installs a live-stamped replacement under the same
key before letting go, so a pop by key alone would kill the runtime the spare
exists to keep. A release whose pin no longer matches pops nothing, returns
`False`, and leaves the replacement to the post-condition.

**Per-turn stamp gate** (`flag_identity_stamp_mismatches`, before the
unchanged early-return in the turn gate): a session whose stamp provably
differs from the live account is flagged `retire_on_identity_change` and its
resume sid cleared (mirroring the sweep — the flag makes `close_all` skip the
pointer re-map, so an uncleared sid would survive restart and hand the
replacement child the flagged account's conversation). A proven-mismatch
companion runtime — busy or idle — is displaced out of its claimable slot
(`_subagent_runtimes` / the `_bg` slot) and parked: `_draining_subagent_runtimes`
for companions, the existing `_draining_bg_runtimes` for the background
runtime. Kills happen only on a LATER drain pass, once idle and past a park
grace (`identity_park_grace_remaining`) that outlasts the sub-second window
where a just-claimed runtime still reads idle. The companion drain reap
removes only the entries it actually killed — the kill awaits, and a rebuild
from a pre-await snapshot would drop a concurrently parked runtime from the
only list that still references it. Parked runtimes stay PID-shielded, count
against sweep completeness, and are torn down at `close_all`.

## Key Behaviors

- **Empty-response recovery ladder** (dashboard chat runner, depth-0 turns
  only): a completed turn with no visible output, no refusal reasons, and no
  cancellation is treated as a transient provider failure and recovered
  through a bounded three-rung ladder driven by `slot._empty_response_retries`,
  with `slot._empty_episode_productive` carrying one episode-scoped fact the
  counter cannot (rung 3 below):
  1. **first empty** → the ORIGINAL message is silently re-queued at the
     front of the slot queue (no visible card). Reached ONLY by a turn with no
     activity — see the productive-turn exclusion below;
  2. **later empties** (the same-message retry also produced nothing) → a
     synthetic continue nudge (`_EMPTY_AUTO_CONTINUE_MSG` — a DIFFERENT
     message, since re-sending the identical prompt tends to reproduce the
     identical empty generation) is queued on the SAME live session, with a
     transcript-visible notice card. The budget is
     `session.empty_response_max_continues` (default 1 — one nudge, notice
     "auto-continuing once"; above 1 consecutive failures keep continuing and
     the notice shows "recovery N of M"). Gated by
     `session.empty_response_auto_continue` (default ON; the gate fails open),
     and suppressed while a Stop is active;
  3. **budget exhausted** (the nudges also produced nothing) → terminal notice card
     asking the user to send a message; the counter resets so the next
     genuine user turn gets a fresh budget. The card's sentences are the
     constants in `messaging/empty_turn_copy.py`, shared with the channel
     driver's empty-turn verdict so a channel thread mirrored into the dashboard
     reads one story. The card's wording is cause-aware,
     mirroring rung 2's split, and the split is decided per EPISODE, not per
     turn: the card says the turn ended without a closing reply and that
     completed steps will not re-run whenever THIS turn was productive **or**
     any earlier turn of the same episode was (never "returned nothing", which
     is false for such an episode and — read back by the model via the
     transcript — invites a redo of landed side effects). The episode half is
     what `slot._empty_episode_productive` carries: set at rung 2's productive
     branch, and cleared BOTH beside the counter on a landed turn AND at the start
     of any dispatch the drain did not re-queue as recovery. `_synthetic_payload` is
     true for a CONTINUATION-tagged entry and for an untagged one, which falls through
     to the entry's kind — so the auth-required and poisoned-conversation requeues
     count even though they carry the user's own text. It is false for an
     ORIGINAL-tagged verbatim replay, which only rung 1 queues, and rung 1 requires the
     counter below 1 while the flag is only set with it at 2 or more, so the flag is
     already clear on that path. The second clear is what makes
     the flag independent of the several controls that discard a queued
     continuation without landing a turn (the hard-kill Stop's queue clear, a rewind
     commit's rebuild). None of those
     resets the recovery counter, so a spent counter can still route a LATER
     request into rung 2, and that request's own turns must not inherit this
     episode's evidence. The counter's own staleness across those controls is
     pre-existing and not redefined here.

     The episode is deliberately NOT keyed on the two continuation bodies. The
     runner queues other recoveries of its own and can put one AHEAD of this
     ladder's — a Stop hook's `decision: block` prepends at index 0 in the same
     teardown that queued the ladder's continuation there — and those turns are
     the SAME episode, whose productive first turn has already run its tools, so
     they keep the no-rerun wording instead of inviting a resend. A body test also
     could not be identity on its own, since the bodies are fixed runner-authored
     strings a user can paste. The rest of the split is needed
     because
     the counter cannot separate the two paths that both arrive at 2 (a
     productive turn's `= 2` jump and the plain ladder's two `+= 1` steps), and
     the per-turn `EmptyTurnActivity` is rebuilt every turn, so a productive
     turn whose continuation returns nothing would otherwise be described by
     its empty continuation alone. The predicate is monotone: it can only move
     a card from the counter wording to the productive wording, never back, so
     no already-correct card changes. For an episode that was NEVER productive
     the recovery clause appears only when the counter shows budget was spent,
     and claims only that automatic recovery was attempted — the counter counts
     budget, not which rungs ran (with the auto-continue gate off, give-up
     arrives at one with no auto-continue). Give-up with the counter at zero is
     reachable non-productive only on nested depth>0 turns, where the card
     reports only the empty turn (the gate-off zero-counter path is productive
     by construction and takes the productive wording).

  **A PRODUCTIVE turn never reaches rung 1.** "Empty" at this branch means only
  that the FINAL assistant segment is empty, which is not the same as "the turn
  did nothing": `assistant_text` is reset at every tool boundary, so a turn that
  streamed an answer and then called a tool arrives here with its answer already
  flushed, persisted and on screen, and a tool-only turn arrives here having run
  real side effects. Rung 1 re-queues the user's own message, so for either shape
  it re-executes completed tool calls (a second `send_message`, a second write, a
  second PR) and re-derives an answer the user has already read — observed in the
  field as two consecutive billed `end_turn` turns, each with a preamble and
  successful tool calls, both classified empty and the first verbatim-replayed.
  `chat_utils.EmptyTurnActivity.productive` is the guard: a flushed visible
  segment, a dispatched tool call, or thinking. A productive turn skips to rung 2,
  which carries `_ACTIVITY_NO_REPLY_CONTINUE_MSG` instead — the same
  `EMPTY_RESPONSE_RECOVERY_PREFIX` marker (so no new recovery card or locale pair
  is needed) with a body that does NOT claim the turn produced nothing, because
  that body is read by the model and would invite it to redo work whose side
  effects already landed. Its notice card differs for the same reason. The ladder
  bound is unchanged: a productive turn spends the same budget, it simply never
  spends it on a replay. `_produced_visible_output` deliberately does NOT cover
  this case — its narrow meaning (only the mid-turn resets that are not tool
  boundaries: steer cut, compaction, clear, agent switch) is load-bearing for the
  promise-only guard.

  A successfully delivered non-blocking `ask_question` directive is different
  from a generic productive tool-only turn: its card is the intended terminal
  output, and the tool explicitly tells the model to end until the user's answer
  arrives as a new message. The runner therefore records the successful card
  outcome and skips the entire empty-response ladder. Delivery failures keep the
  normal behavior so the model can fall back to a plain-text question.

  **Turn-end diagnostics.** The branch emits ONE privacy-safe WARNING per empty
  verdict, after the rung is chosen, naming a closed `cause` and `rung` plus
  booleans: `provider_empty`, `tool_only`, `thinking_only`, `visible_partial`,
  `no_terminal_event`, `synthetic_completion` or `other`
  (`chat_utils.classify_empty_turn`, ranked most-specific first), and `replay` /
  `continue` / `give_up`. `EmptyTurnActivity` carries whether a terminal
  `EVENT_COMPLETE` arrived, whether the provider SYNTHESIZED it, the terminal stop
  reason normalised onto a closed set (`chat_utils.normalize_stop_reason` — an
  omitted reason answers `absent`, which is a distinct observation from a clean
  `end_turn` and must not be laundered into one, and an unrecognised backend
  string answers `other` rather than being echoed), whether text streamed, whether
  a visible segment was flushed at a tool boundary, whether tools ran, whether
  thinking ran, and whether the provider reported ANY billing dimension. Every
  field is a bool or a closed constant by contract: no prompts, responses,
  thinking, tool arguments or results, paths, identities, token counts or costs.
  The predecessor logged only `Empty model response (attempt N)`, which could not
  separate a provider that generated nothing from a turn whose answer a tool
  boundary flushed away from a turn no terminal event ever closed — three faults
  with three different owners, and one field incident hit all three in three
  consecutive attempts.

  Recovery rungs 1–2 skip persistence/consolidation/success-recording (the
  empty turn is never saved) and preserve all other retry budgets. Synthetic
  recovery messages (`_SYNTHETIC_RECOVERY_MSGS`: the post-transient CONTINUE
  instruction and the empty-response nudge) are excluded from the
  genuine-new-turn allowance reset, so a recovery turn can never refresh its
  own budget; on the queue-drain path they classify as **recovery**
  STRUCTURALLY — ``queue_insert`` tags the entry ``kind="synthetic_recovery"``
  and every queue consumer (merge predicate, sub-agent hold, drain-role
  assignment, reset-notice consumption) dispatches on that metadata, never on
  content equality, so classification survives queue transformations and a
  user pasting the recovery text verbatim still classifies as plain user
  speech. The transcript append uses the `inject` role (never `user`, so an
  internal orchestration instruction is never persisted as user-authored
  history or mirrored to linked channels), draining one does not cancel a
  pending synthesis, and the tag is merge-breaking so a nudge is never folded
  into a `[N queued messages merged]` user turn. At `_prompt_depth > 0` the ladder is disabled entirely (terminal
  notice on the first empty) to prevent nested-turn re-queue loops.
- **Leaked tool-call notice** (dashboard chat runner, depth-0 turns only,
  issue #6112): a turn that ends normally with an invoke block emitted as
  TEXT and zero tool calls executed — the model wrote its invocation into the
  prose channel instead of dispatching it (observed with deferred MCP tools
  whose schema is not yet bound, and with large nested arguments) — surfaces
  a visible notice card and is marked un-landed (no success recording, no
  budget reset, no consolidation), so an unattended monitor/autonudge cycle
  that leaked never lands silently. Detection is machine-shaped
  (`chat_utils.has_leaked_tool_call`): an unquoted invoke open tag plus a
  parameter or close tag, with fenced code blocks and inline code spans
  stripped first so a pasted transcript or explained example never matches;
  the gate (`should_notice_leaked_tool_call`) is claimed ahead of the
  promise-only guard. Deliberately **notice-only** — no continuation is
  queued, because an injected "re-issue that call" would carry runtime
  authority into sessions where the call auto-approves (slot trust, global
  yolo, or a static agent tool allowlist, the last invisible at the runner
  layer, so no fail-closed downgrade condition exists) and the leaked block
  may be untrusted external content the model merely reproduced. A loop loses
  one cycle, visibly, and retries on its own schedule. Scope limit: the
  notice/un-landing applies only to ZERO-tool-call turns — a mixed turn that
  executed tools and then leaked its final dispatch as text lands normally
  (un-landing a turn whose earlier calls had real side effects would
  misdescribe it) and gets its own notice card, worded for that shape:
  the earlier calls were ATTEMPTED and may already have taken effect, so the
  reader is told to check what landed rather than that nothing ran
  (`should_notice_mixed_turn_leak`).
- **Leak dropped at a compaction boundary** (issue #11995): a REAL
  (non-synthesized) mid-turn compaction terminal is a segment boundary, so the
  runner clears `assistant_text` there — text streamed before the
  summarization belongs to the window that was just summarized and must not
  carry into the segment flushed afterwards. Both gates above read that
  accumulator AT TURN END, so a leak that streamed BEFORE the boundary was
  invisible to them and both declined on an empty segment, while the raw
  invoke block had already reached the user (chunks stream to the wire as they
  arrive) and the boundary flushes nothing. The turn then took the
  post-compaction continuation arm precisely BECAUSE the segment was blank, so
  the session showed raw machine syntax followed by "continuing
  automatically", ran no tool, and accounted for neither. The scan therefore
  runs AT the boundary, before the clear, and only the resulting boolean
  travels to turn end (`should_notice_compaction_dropped_leak`); a scan placed
  after the clear reads an empty string and silently restores the defect, which
  is why the ordering carries a source-level ratchet, and the recorded fact
  ACCUMULATES (`or`) so a turn crossing two boundaries does not lose the first
  one's leak to a later clean segment. Strictly notice-only and weaker than both
  siblings: it un-lands nothing and sets no flag a recovery arm reads. Because it
  owns no turn outcome it is evaluated OUTSIDE the `if`/`elif` chain its siblings
  sit in — every arm of that chain owns the outcome and two are recoveries (the
  L1 infrastructure retry, the promise-only guard), and since these gates exclude
  neither shape, an exclusive slot would starve a turn that both dropped a leak
  and needed a recovery. One turn still gets one leak card, enforced by a flag
  the siblings set (`leak_already_noticed`) rather than by position. It needs no
  tool-count gate (that gate protects un-landing, and there is nothing here to
  un-land).
- **False current-tool-blocker recovery** (dashboard chat runner, depth-0 turns
  only): a normal turn that successfully completed only host-owned read/search/fetch
  preparation tools and then claims that *this turn* exhausted its tool budget or
  can no longer execute tools is not allowed to land as completed work. Kiro Crew
  receives real tool failures through refusal/error/result frames; a call
  lacking a terminal `status=completed` result has no final completion proof
  and remains ineligible. With no such failure and exact completion evidence, that
  self-referential blocker is model-authored rather than a runtime verdict. The
  turn uses the existing promise-only one-shot continuation and non-landing
  accounting, so the next turn tries the pending action instead of asking the user
  to type "continue." One provider-canonical identity and call id are retained per
  dispatch; the id set must exactly equal the final `status=completed` result set.
  Only the fixed non-MCP builtin allow-list is eligible. Its five shared
  read/search/fetch identities come from the host approval gate's proven
  read-only registry; `introspect` and `tool_search` are explicit replay-only
  discovery extensions and do not widen that auto-approval registry. This replay gate
  deliberately does not inherit the separate approval path's `tool_kind`
  classifier: replay can repeat an already completed turn, so it requires a
  positive Kiro-backend capability (declared fail-closed on the provider ABC),
  `tool_identity_trusted=true` minted from an adapter-authored canonical
  tool-name marker (`_meta.kiro.toolName` on the eligible Kiro backend),
  stable canonical identity, host ownership, and final-result proof.
  A familiar non-empty `tool_name` is not provenance. The
  allow-list is specific to Kiro's canonical builtin identities; KAS and other
  selectable backends remain manual until they expose equivalent identities and
  round-trip tests. Agent-influenced ACP `tool_kind`, MCP tools, unknown identity,
  duplicate/missing ids, and every count/status mismatch fail closed. The blocker
  must be a full match of one of the two captured incident statements; other
  wording, appended instructions, or announced actions is ineligible, including
  prose copied from a fetched document. Blocker-adjacent wording that misses the
  exact grammar remains ineligible but emits a text-free WARNING after otherwise
  proven read-only preparation, making recurrence drift observable without
  granting replay authority.
  Recovery is limited to authenticated-human turns and replays that exact
  original user message, captured at runner entry before cancelled-turn,
  subagent-failure, or silent app-context enrichment. Its provenance is
  preserved; model-authored blocker, action text, and injected context never
  become the next prompt or mirrored user speech. This remains safe with static
  `allowedTools`, MCP `autoApprove`, and hook grants: those mechanisms may skip a
  tool approval, but the retried authority is still the user's own request. The
  queued replay preserves the triggering row's validated attachment lists so
  `[attached_file N]` and `[attached_dir N]` markers still resolve losslessly,
  including paths containing whitespace. It carries a distinct structural kind so
  a Stop, follow-up, or steer arriving after enqueue purges it before dispatch and
  resets the one-shot budget. Rebinding the slot to another session while the replay
  waits also purges it and resets that budget. If the single replay ends in the same
  blocker, the spent-budget arm emits a give-up notice and never queues a second replay. No
  host-authored fresh, resumed, or compacted-session context tells the model that
  tools became unavailable or assigns a per-turn tool budget; provider failures
  continue to use their control frames. This remains an interim mitigation for an
  unsupported model self-report, not a diagnosis of a resume-path provider
  failure. Phrasings beyond the two captured full statements deliberately remain
  manual; a new recurrence must be diagnosed before the grammar expands. Any
  identity or completion shape outside the proven allow-list falls through to the
  landed-turn behavior, preventing a completed mutation from being replayed. The
  normal Stop, user-follow-up, pending-steer, approval/refusal,
  and one-shot gates remain unchanged; trusted or global auto-approve sessions
  retain the existing notice-only downgrade.
- **Context compaction**: at ≥ configured threshold (`session.autocompact_pct`, default 70%, valid 5–90), compacts **in place** on a member of
  `ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT` — kiro-cli, claude, codex, opencode and goose. They divide by WHERE
  the
  done signal lands, which is `ACP_BACKENDS_INLINE_COMPACTION`: kiro-cli sends a
  `/compact` **prompt** (`session/prompt` + `_kiro.dev/compaction/status` watch —
  never the string form of `_kiro.dev/commands/execute`, which kiro-cli 2.14.0
  exits rc=0 on) and its result arrives afterwards, while claude, codex, opencode and
  goose finish the whole compaction inside the prompt turn. claude and opencode emit no
  status at all, and goose emits only a `Compaction complete` chunk; codex reports the compaction as a `tool_call` pair marked
  `_meta.contextCompaction` (translated by
  `_dispatch.parse_codex_compaction_update`) that arrives before the prompt
  response, so its terminal is read from the stream like kiro-cli's.
  For the two that emit nothing `wait_for_compaction()` answers `completed` from the
  capability
  rather than from the queue — but only when the turn reached its own end
  boundary uncancelled, since a cancelled turn compacted nothing and a false
  `completed` resets the meter AND arms the cooldown. Awaiting the queue for an
  inline member instead spends the full compaction wait budget
  (`COMPACT_WAIT_TIMEOUT_SECS`, raised per host by `session.compact_wait_secs`)
  and then
  recycles a session that had just compacted correctly. That answer lives on the
  WAIT, because every route to a compaction reaches it — the channel entry
  points and the task runner's context-overflow compaction through
  `provider.compact()`, the dashboard `/compact` as a chat turn, the
  autocompact through `stream_command("/compact")`. Every route passes the same
  budget, resolved in one place: each caller holds the session manager and
  reads `SessionManager.compact_wait_budget_secs()`, which resolves
  `session.compact_wait_secs` from the manager's config (re-adopted on every
  live change, so a standalone `kirocrew run`, which arms no live-config
  watcher, still honours it).

  A backend outside that set takes one of three arms, each a positive
  membership so that an unclassified harness cannot fall into a claim by
  accident:

  - `ACP_BACKENDS_HARNESS_MANAGED_COMPACTION` (KAS) is **declined**
    (`"compact_unsupported"`, see the gate ladder below). KAS never answers the
    `/compact` prompt with a compaction status, so an ungated dispatch stranded
    the status wait for the whole budget WHILE HOLDING the turn semaphore and
    then recycled the session, losing the live conversation (#7812) — it
    summarizes on its own initiative and its `summarization_completed` frame
    resets the meter, so declining leaves nothing unmanaged.
  - `ACP_BACKENDS_CONTEXT_RECYCLE` (deepseek) is **recycled**. Its ACP surface
    carries no compaction of any kind, so declining bounded nothing and the
    context grew toward the harness's own window. `_recycle_unmanaged` reaches
    the same destination a failed compaction already reaches, on the reason
    rather than after spending the timeout that proves it. The arm falls THROUGH
    the gate rung rather than returning from it, so `unconfirmed`, `in_progress`
    and `cooldown` still run first — an ambiguous reading must not spend a
    recycle.
  - A backend in none of the three is **declined and logged at WARNING**, naming
    the missing membership. Declining is the safe action, since the alternative
    ends a conversation and no harness earns that by never having been
    classified, but it is not a settled condition and the log says so. pi is that
    case today: it looks inline in SOURCE but has no driven capture, which is the
    bar `ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT` holds its members to.

  Every surface that refuses a manual `/compact` picks among three sentences via
  `messaging.commands.compact_refusal_arm`, so a surface supplies wording only and
  cannot disagree with the others about which case a backend is in.

  The
  process and session ID survive, so queued/agentic work continues
  automatically. kiro-cli only: if the in-place compact fails, times out,
  or the provider lacks native support, falls back to the legacy
  **recycle** (kill session; context re-injected via
  `build_session_context()` on next message). A recycle is never forced
  through a live turn — if the turn semaphore cannot be acquired within
  the budget, the attempt is deferred to the next turn-end check. A
  compaction whose IMMEDIATELY-MEASURED effect verdict (a confirmed reading
  taken right after the attempt, showing a real but < 5-point drop) is still
  ≥ `_POST_COMPACT_RESET_PCT` (95%) escalates to a reset with the native
  resume sid cleared in the same tick as the pop
  (`reset(clear_conversation=True)` via `_reset_still_critical` — promoted
  from the task runner's post-check, #4686). Deferred (next-reading) verdict
  settles are deliberately damping-only: that reading includes the following
  turn's own growth, so it cannot distinguish a failed compaction from a
  successful one regrown by a large turn — it arms the cooldown but never
  resets. The escalation is AWAITED (the `compact_if_needed` seam returns
  `"reset"`), performed BEFORE the compaction callback fires (the callback
  awaits arbitrary surface I/O, and a turn completing inside that window
  must not be erased by a verdict measured before it ran), pins the measured
  session's identity (`expect_session`) so a stale escalation never destroys
  a replacement registered under the same key, and honors `skip_if_busy` (a
  declined reset maps back to `"ok"`; the still-critical session re-attempts
  the whole compact-and-escalate cycle at its next threshold crossing after
  the cooldown, with the mid-stream overflow guard covering the interim).
  There is no prompt-count fallback on this path — the 40-prompt blind backstop
  belongs to `recycle_background()` alone (see "Context Overflow Protection").
- **Circuit breaker**: force-resets session after 5 consecutive failures.
- **Dead provider detection**: `get_or_create()` checks `provider.is_alive()`
  on the fast path. If the backing process died (crash, SIGKILL, orphan
  cleanup), the stale session entry is removed and a fresh cold-start
  occurs with `is_new=True` — ensuring full context re-injection. Without
  this, the context builder would see `is_new=False` and skip episodic
  memory, leaving the new ACP process with zero history.
- **Per-session semaphore**: serializes concurrent messages on the same
  thread key. `get_or_create()` acquires; caller must `release()` when done.
  This includes named workflow steps: retaining conversation state requires
  `release(cleanup=False)`, not retaining the semaphore between calls.
- **Post-semaphore revalidation** (`_reacquire_and_validate`): the per-session
  semaphore may be held for a full turn, so it is ALWAYS acquired with the
  global `self._lock` RELEASED (pinning the lock across that wait would freeze
  session creation for every key and reintroduce a lock-ordering deadlock).
  Because a session can be recycled/removed or its backing process can die
  while a caller waits on the semaphore, every reuse path re-checks identity +
  liveness AFTER acquiring it, through the single shared helper
  `_reacquire_and_validate(key, sess)`. Its contract: it returns `True` with
  the semaphore **still held** (caller MUST `release`), or `False` having
  **already released** it (session went stale — caller evicts via
  `_evict_stale_session` and cold-starts). Cancellation while parked on
  `self._lock` after the acquire releases the semaphore before propagating, so
  the key never stays permanently locked. Liveness uses
  `_provider_effectively_alive` (a dead Claude-Code `per_session` process
  counts as alive — it reconnects lazily on the next `stream()`).
  Consolidating this acquire→relock→revalidate dance in ONE place is
  deliberate: a divergent copy is exactly how the stale-provider bug class gets
  reintroduced. ALL three multiplexing reuse paths route through it — the
  `get_or_create` fast path, its won-by-another-coroutine race path, and
  `open_task_session` (both its fast path AND its lost-race branch, where a task
  step that loses the registration race would otherwise wait a turn on the
  winner's semaphore and be multiplexed onto a recycled/dead runtime). A stale
  winner triggers a bounded cold-start retry (`_WON_RACE_MAX_RETRIES`). The
  only bare `semaphore.acquire()` sites are: the helper itself; a
  brand-new session the caller just created and registered (no recycle window);
  and `try_acquire` (a non-blocking, no-`await`-suspension atomic take used by
  out-of-band `/compact`, which returns `False` on contention rather than
  waiting, so it has no stale-while-waiting window).
- **Agent-model resolution cache** (`_resolve_agent_model`, class-level
  `_agent_model_cache`): the per-agent model pin resolved from agent JSON is
  cached but invalidated on BOTH the agents-dir mtime changing (a new agent
  JSON appearing bumps the dir mtime) AND a TTL (`_AGENT_MODEL_CACHE_TTL`, for
  in-place edits that leave the dir mtime unchanged). Without invalidation an
  early `"auto"` miss (agent JSON not yet present) would be pinned forever, so a
  later create/edit of the agent config would never be observed. The scan reads
  each spec through `agent_discovery._read_agent_spec`, the hardened reader that
  module documents as the one reader for both agent scopes: `~/.kiro/agents` is
  user-writable and shared with kiro-cli, so the read is size-capped and refuses
  a link resolving onto a sensitive target rather than resolving a model out of
  whatever the link names. A refused spec is skipped like a malformed one, so
  the resolution falls through to `"auto"` exactly as an absent spec does.
- **Idle cleanup**: expires sessions after `session.timeout_secs` (default
  60min). Never expires `BACKGROUND_KEY`. Dashboard per-tab sessions
  (`dashboard:{slot_key}`) idle-expire like any other session.
  A session is also expired on a second, clock-independent axis: its owning
  dashboard slot is gone. `SessionCleanup._owner_is_gone()` answers that, and it
  asks a deliberately different question of two populations. A
  `dashboard:`-prefixed key is slot-owned by construction, so absence from
  `CleanupState.active_dashboard_slots` settles it; that set is published by
  `chat_utils._sync_dashboard_slots`, which sends the *effective* key of every
  open slot. A key of any other shape, such as a channel-born slot's channel key
  or a linked slot's `linked_session_key` (`taskrunner:{id}:chat:{tok}`,
  `cron:{job}`), is slot-owned only if a published live set once carried it.
  That is recorded in `CleanupState.slot_owned_keys` at publish time and pruned
  to the keys that still have a live session OR a slot open right now, so the
  record is bounded by two finite sets rather than by uptime. That prune runs at
  BOTH ends, each sweep and each publish, because the sweep is not guaranteed to
  run at all: `session.timeout_secs=0` leaves `idle_sweep_enabled` false, and the
  sweep is where the other prune lives, so a record bounded only there would grow
  with every key ever published and never shrink. The two use one expression, so
  they are idempotent rather than two policies. The
  second half of that bound is load-bearing: a slot publishes its linked key as
  soon as it opens, which can precede the first turn that creates the session,
  and a prune against the session map alone would forget the record while the
  slot is still open. A key kept only because it is in the live set cannot be
  reaped while it stays there, since `_owner_is_gone` requires absence from that
  same set. A key that `messaging.link.is_channel_session_key` recognises is
  never recorded at all: a dashboard slot opened on a channel conversation
  publishes the CONVERSATION's own key (`slack:{ts}` and its siblings), which
  the channel owns, so dismissing that viewer proves nothing about whether the
  thread is finished and reaping it would tear a live conversation's runtime
  down mid-thread. The sweep already skips `channel:`-prefixed keys for the same
  reason; the other channel namespaces do not carry that prefix, so the
  exclusion is spelled at the record as well.

  The record describes ONE incarnation, so on the TERMINATED-OWNER path it
  is released just before that session's `reset`, not left for the next sweep's
  prune: the prune runs during the scan, ahead of every reset, so a record left
  behind outlives its session and a later fire arriving under the same key would
  inherit a claim it never made and be reaped though it never had a tab. An IDLE
  reap deliberately keeps the record: there the slot is typically still open,
  which is why the owner-gone test said no, and the record describes the SLOT's
  claim, which outlives any one session under it. The
  release sits before the `reset` rather than after it succeeds, so a publish
  landing inside `reset`'s await re-adds the key, which is the right answer when
  a slot reopens for it. A `reset` that DECLINES because the session turned busy
  restores the record itself, because the release described a session that is
  still registered: without that restore the key would leave this axis entirely
  while its tab stays closed, since it is absent from the live set, carries no
  `dashboard:` prefix and nothing else re-adds it, and would fall back to the
  idle clock. That restore is also conditioned on the terminated-owner path, so
  a declined idle reset cannot CREATE a claim for a session no slot ever made
  one for. The record is what makes the axis safe:
  without it, absence from the live set is equally true of a `cron:` fire, a
  `taskrunner:{id}:task{n}` step or a `hook:` session that is running right now
  and never had a tab, so reaping on absence alone would end live work instead
  of finished work. One further guard applies to this axis only, the live-set
  re-assert below; the sub-agent probe is asked on BOTH axes, and the call
  carries a third question the RSS recycle shares. The sweep consults the
  same `CleanupDeps.has_attached_subagents` probe the RSS recycle uses,
  fail-closed, because with session sharing on a parent's children run on its
  runtime after its own turn ends and the busy semaphore cannot see them. The
  idle clock reaches that probe as well as the orphan test does: a long
  sub-agent run is exactly what lets a parent's `last_used` go stale, and an
  idle expiry that skipped the probe would fire `on_session_expire` and reset
  the runtime the children are still working on. That
  same wrapper answers a second question FIRST, and synchronously: whether a
  completion injection is in flight for the key
  (`CleanupDeps.has_pending_injection`, installed by the gateway over its
  `_cron_injecting` counter). The gateway raises that counter before awaiting
  the injected turn's store read, so until `get_or_create` runs the session
  holds no permit, the delivering sub-agent is already `done` and so absent from
  the running set, and a closed tab leaves no in-flight delivery either: every
  other signal reads "finished" while a turn is already committed to that
  session, and the reset discards the runtime that turn is about to write into.
  The counter is the only witness, which is why the gateway's own three reset
  sites consult it and the sweep, as the fourth resetter, now does too. It is
  read inside the SHARED fail-closed wrapper, so the RSS recycle honours it as
  well, and an unreadable counter keeps the session like any other unanswerable
  probe. The sweep asks it in its own right, BEFORE the axis split, so both reap
  branches honour it: the axis that elected a session says nothing about whether
  a turn is committed to it, and the clock alone can elect a never-tabbed
  `cron:{job}` parent whose `last_used` went stale during the very sub-agent run
  whose completion injection is in flight. Every branch that resets suspends
  on the sub-agent probe -- the sweep on both its axes and the RSS recycle --
  so each reads the counter ONCE MORE after that probe, because an injection
  starting inside its await is invisible to any earlier read. On the RSS
  recycle that re-read is the last statement before `reset`. In the sweep it is
  the first of four post-await re-judges, all synchronous and all asked about
  the entry the scan carried out: the counter; then the incarnation, on both
  axes (the key must still hold the session the sweep judged, because
  `on_session_expire` consolidates the transcript ahead of `reset` and a
  `reset` that declines on the mismatch afterwards does not undo a
  consolidation already run over a newcomer's transcript -- and on the orphan
  axis a departed incarnation loses its old slot-claim record only while the
  key is still absent from the current live set; a reopened slot republishes a
  fresh claim for its replacement, which the stale verdict must preserve);
  then the semaphore (a turn that took it during the await is exactly as live
  as one the scan skipped); then, on the idle axis only, the clock (a turn that
  began AND finished inside the await released the semaphore again but bumped
  `last_used` on its way in, so the session is not idle now -- the orphan axis
  ignores the clock and re-asserts against the live set instead, below).
  Nothing between the probe's return and `reset` suspends. Neither read is the atomic
  one, though: `reset` itself suspends on the registry lock before it validates
  anything, so an injection beginning while that lock is contended is invisible
  to every read a caller took first. Both resetters therefore pass
  `reset(skip_if_injecting=True)`, which asks the counter UNDER that lock beside
  the identity and semaphore re-validations, so the answer is atomic with the
  pop. The sweep's own reads stay as a cheap early-out that names its own reason
  in the log. The option is opt-in, so a user-initiated reset still wins over an
  injection, and it fails closed locally: an unreadable counter declines that one
  reset rather than raising through a sweep with other candidates to visit.
  The guard DEFERS the reap rather
  than exempting the key: once the counter returns to zero the next sweep expires
  it, so the runtime this axis exists to release is not held for good by a window
  that has closed.
  Every verdict this sweep reaches is about ONE incarnation, so on BOTH axes the
  reset is pinned to it: the scan carries the session object out with its key and
  passes it as `reset(expect_session=...)`, which revalidates identity under the
  registry lock and declines on a mismatch. The probe suspends on either axis,
  and the orphan axis adds the scan's lock release ahead of it, so the key can
  change hands before the act -- a cron job firing again, a tab reopened and a
  turn taken -- and a key-only reset would hand that newcomer a verdict reached
  about its predecessor; on the idle axis it would shut down exactly the
  replacement runtime. The record restore on a declined reset
  is conditioned on the same identity, which covers both reasons for a decline:
  a session that is merely busy is the one whose claim was released, so the claim
  goes back, while a key that changed hands must not have a claim invented for
  its new holder. On the orphan axis
  the answer is then re-asserted against the current live set. That re-assert
  must be the LAST read of the live set before `reset`, which is why it sits
  after the probe rather than before it: two awaits separate the scan from the
  act, the lock release and the probe's off-loop task-store read, and a slot can
  reopen in either window. Everything between the re-assert and `reset` is
  synchronous by requirement, so a check placed any earlier reopens the window
  it exists to close and a session the user has just resumed loses its runtime.
  Fail-closed has one accepted residual: a probe that cannot answer keeps every
  candidate it is asked about, on the idle sweep, the orphan axis and the RSS
  recycle alike, so a probe broken system-wide holds every reap until it
  recovers. That is the right answer for the sessions -- reaping on a probe
  that cannot see the children is the hazard the guard exists to prevent. When
  the probe RAISES, its visibility is a WARNING bounded by
  `SessionCleanup.PROBE_FAILURE_WARN_INTERVAL_SECS` (at most one line per
  interval across all keys, `CleanupState.probe_failure_warned_at`), with every
  failure keeping its traceback at debug, so a persistent break stays visible
  in the log without a line per candidate per tick. An unreadable task store
  does not raise to this wrapper: `subagents_attached_async` absorbs it and
  answers "attached" (`taskq_bridge.UNKNOWN_PENDING`), so that cause surfaces
  only as the per-key "still has sub-agent work - left running" INFO line, not
  as the bounded WARNING.
  While no live set has been published at all
  (`active_dashboard_slots is None`) the axis expires nothing, so a build with
  no dashboard keeps the idle timer as its only reaper. The policy is
  **re-read every tick**, not frozen at loop start: `_adopt_idle_policy()` runs
  at the top of the loop and again before each sleep, taking
  `session.timeout_secs` and `session.watchdog_rss_max_mb` off the manager's
  current `_cfg` (which the config watcher keeps current) and re-applying the
  same bounds the loader does — the 60s floor, the `0` = sweep-disabled
  sentinel, and the non-negative-int coercion of the RSS ceiling — plus a
  `MAX_TICK_INTERVAL_SECS` = 300s **ceiling on the derived interval itself**.
  The ceiling exists because one tick drives the idle-expiry hook AND every
  housekeeping sweep below it, so deriving the cadence from `timeout_secs`
  alone coupled the sweeps to a setting about something else and coupled it
  backwards: `timeout_secs=86400` gave an `86400 // 6` four-hour tick while
  DISABLING idle expiry (`timeout_secs=0`) gave 300s, so asking for long-lived
  sessions bought slower orphan cleanup than switching the idle sweep off.
  Capping cannot expire a session early — `_expire_idle_hook` passes
  `state.idle_timeout`, so the timeout still decides WHEN a session is stale
  and the interval only decides how often the question is asked — and it is a
  ceiling, not a floor, so sub-300s intervals are untouched. The sleep
  between sweeps is chopped into waits of at most `POLICY_REFRESH_SECS` (60s);
  each wake re-adopts the policy and, when the interval moved, re-anchors the
  next sweep to the last sweep plus the new interval, so a shortened timeout
  pulls the sweep forward within one refresh cadence rather than waiting out
  the old interval. Elapsed time is accounted from the waits the loop issued,
  not the wall clock, so the cadence is a property of the loop alone. A
  transition is logged ONCE, not per tick:
  `CleanupState.idle_policy_source` holds the `(timeout, rss_max)` pair the
  policy was last derived from and the log fires only when that pair moves.
- **Session Watchdog** (`watchdog.py`): `SessionCleanup` owns the cleanup-loop
  state and delegates named periodic behaviours to a `SessionWatchdog` — a
  stateless sequential dispatcher over `CleanupHook(name, run)` entries
  (`tick()` isolates a hook failure with a debug-level backstop only, never
  promoting the severity of errors the lifted inline blocks swallowed). The
  hooks are assembled through the `SessionManager` facade so existing
  monkeypatch seams remain observable: `idle_expiry`, `orphan_mcp`,
  `reap_agent_scopes`, `rss_threshold`, `stuck_turn`, and `bg_drain_reap`.
  `SessionCleanup._cleanup_loop` then directly coordinates the session-root,
  sandbox-artifact, session-pid-mapping, member-pid-binding, shell-audit-log,
  bytecode-cache, periodic tracked-PID, and untracked-MCP sweeps.
- **Runtime reconciler** (`runtime_reconcile.py`): its kill arm is bounded by
  `session.reconcile_max_kills`, re-read from the live config on every tick. The
  field's ceiling equals its default, so it can only lower the shipped budget and
  never raise it; at `0` the arm observes, publishing the same `unowned_alive` /
  `owned_dead` reading and auditing each candidate it would have signalled without
  sending a signal. The arm's own contract — both directions, the conjunction of
  conditions, and the published counters — is specified in
  [runtime-ownership.md](runtime-ownership.md), not here.
- **Reaping abandoned agent scopes** (`session_scope_reap.py`,
  Linux/systemd only): each agent session runs inside a transient
  `systemd-run --user --scope` under a per-instance child of
  `kirocrew-agents.slice` (`sandbox._agents_slice_name`). `--scope` GCs a
  transient unit only after its process exits, so a hard gateway kill or restart
  strands the whole tree: the leader dies, the `launcher`/`kiro-cli`/
  `kiro-cli-chat` + MCP children reparent to the systemd user manager, and
  nothing reaps the scope — the idle/RSS watchdog iterates only
  `_sessions`, the PID sweeps know only tracked roots, and
  `session_pid._is_untracked_managed_agent_orphan` is report-only. The reaper
  reconciles the cgroup tree (the only authority on what this instance leaked)
  against the live registry. It runs on every cleanup tick via the
  `reap_agent_scopes` hook — never on the gateway boot path
  (`AUTOSDE.yaml` `no-new-work-on-gateway-boot-path`: an orphan sweep whose
  cost scales with leaked state must not delay `KIROCREW_READY`), so the first
  tick after a restart is what picks up a previous gateway's strays; the hook
  gathers the live provider/pool/in-flight
  PID set (so a scope containing any live tree is never touched) and the reaper
  requires a complete tracked-PID snapshot from the `session_pid` files. An
  unreadable or malformed snapshot aborts that tick before any scope is scanned.
  A scope is reclaimed
  only when ALL hold: (i) no member PID is tracked or a live provider; (ii-a)
  AT LEAST ONE member has positive agent-runtime argv identity — the generated
  launcher, an exact argv0 basename of `kiro-cli`, `kiro-cli-chat`,
  `claude-agent-acp`, or `claude`, or a marked MCP launcher — OR EVERY member is
  a marked toolbox sandbox credential helper (an argv0 ending
  `/sandbox/creds_agent` carrying a `--session-id` argv token, version-independent
  because the toolbox version sits above `sandbox/` in the path), which is a scope
  with nothing but the helper left in it: the helper serves one runtime and
  routinely outlives it, and each holds tens of threads while `pids.current`
  counts tasks. It is deliberately not one of the existential identities, since
  one helper must not authorize stopping a sibling; either arm is the
  scope-wide stop authorization; (ii-b) EVERY member is this install's own — it
  carries the `KIROCREW_SPAWNED` marker, or its `ppid` chain reaches a
  marker-bearing member without leaving the scope's member set (ownership is by
  tree: env-clearing grandchildren such as `chrome-headless` renderers under a
  playwright `node` daemon carry no marker, and that leaked daemon tree is the
  multi-GB survivor users report); an unreadable `environ` fails closed to "not
  reclaimable"; (iii) the group leader is dead OR the
  scope's `ActiveEnterTimestampMonotonic` predates this gateway's boot stamp;
  and (iv) the scope is older than the module's 600-second grace floor. Reclaim is
  `systemctl --user stop <unit>`, then a fallback SIGTERM → grace → SIGKILL that
  re-reads `cgroup.procs`, opens a pidfd, requires a post-pin `cgroup.procs`
  read to retain that PID in the same scope, and signals through that pidfd. A
  member attributed before the stop is signalled on identity (same pid, same
  stat start ticks read after the pin), so an env-cleared child whose marked
  parent died to SIGTERM and was reparented still gets the SIGKILL; any other
  member must pass fresh tree ownership, and one that cannot is skipped with a
  logged reason. A recycled PID can therefore never redirect a signal; a host
  without pidfd support leaves the member untouched. The 3 s grace and a 2 s
  settle after SIGKILL (a killed task stays listed until its exit completes)
  each end as soon as the members signalled in that rung have left
  `cgroup.procs`. `pid <= 1` and the gateway's own PID are never signalled,
  and each reclaimed scope emits a SEL `agent_scope_reap` event. Only THIS
  install's per-instance child slice is enumerated: a degraded instance token
  (no per-instance child) is treated as
  "nothing to reap here" rather than reaching into a co-resident gateway's
  scopes. A no-op off Linux or without cgroup v2 delegation
  (`sandbox._probe_cgroup_scope`). Marker inheritance by itself never authorizes
  a scope-wide stop, so an intentional detached server left after its agent
  runtime exits is preserved — including when a credential helper survives
  beside it, because that helper authorizes a stop only where it is the whole
  remaining scope. The accepted fail-closed residual is that a scope
  whose runtime-anchor members have all died is never reclaimed, even if every
  survivor still has the marker or is an attributable env-cleared descendant;
  old skipped scopes are summarized at INFO by stable reason category, making
  that residual operator-visible. Each member's `/proc/<pid>/stat` is read as
  BYTES through `platform_compat.read_proc_stat`; it, `environ` and `cmdline` are
  read lazily and at most once per pid per evaluation, and the reclaim reuses
  those reads (a scope rejected at (i) with an active-enter stamp reads no stat):
  `comm` is whatever a process named itself through `prctl(PR_SET_NAME)`, and a
  text read raises on a name that is not UTF-8. The gateway's own boot stamp is
  read the same way, so a gateway whose `comm` is not UTF-8 still has a stamp
  and the predates-boot arm stays available to it. `systemctl` output is decoded
  with `errors="replace"`, since a localized diagnostic in a legacy locale is
  not UTF-8. One scope whose evaluation or reclaim RAISES costs that scope
  alone: an evaluation error is skipped as category `error`, and a reclaim that
  raises is audited by what it left behind (`completed` when the scope is empty,
  else `failed`, category `reclaim_error`); both count as old, so the INFO
  summary counts them by category on every tick, and the unit is named in a
  WARNING once per scope, phase and exception type, repeated at most hourly while
  it keeps failing and re-armed by the next clean check. An `AssertionError` is
  never absorbed. Residuals: a read that BLOCKS (an `environ` or `cmdline` read
  waiting on a process's mmap lock behind a hung mount) still stalls the sweep;
  and under `/proc` `hidepid`, a live group leader outside the scope whose stat
  cannot be read is taken as dead. Stale
  `session_pid_<pid>.txt`/`.sig` files are separately pruned by
  `_prune_stale_session_pid_files` (below); the reaper adds no second deletion
  path.
- **Stuck-turn reporting** (`_stuck_turn_check`, threshold
  `_STUCK_TURN_REPORT_SECS` = 300s, not configurable): reports a turn whose
  consumer has stopped pulling events. Exists because the per-turn watchdog in
  `acp-client.md` cannot report on itself — it is the `TimeoutError` arm of an
  async generator, so a consumer awaiting inside its own `async for` body
  freezes the generator and that arm never runs again for the turn, which is why
  such a turn emits no stall WARNING at all. This loop has its own timer and no
  dependency on any consumer. Considers only sessions whose semaphore is held
  (the only in-flight signal at this layer), reads `parked_for_secs()` /
  `parked_since` / `awaiting_permission` duck-typed off `provider._handle` so any
  transport growing those accessors is covered, and latches on the park's
  monotonic start so a park outliving the tick is reported once rather than every
  pass. **Detection only**, deliberately: a turn awaiting a human is excluded
  because `agent.tool_approval_timeout_secs` already bounds that wait; ending a
  live turn stays with the in-band path that owns the terminal-event seam and the
  non-lethal continue-nudge; and what the park is blocked on is not knowable from
  here. Logs at WARNING and fires the optional `on_stuck_turn(key, parked_secs)`
  callback — a seam so a surface that can reach the user decides what to do,
  keeping the session layer free of any dashboard import. Swallows its own errors
  like its sibling hooks. The reasoning behind putting this check here rather
  than in the read loop — the placement criterion, what a hook may honestly read
  at this layer, and how out-of-band action stays clear of the in-band recovery
  path — is recorded in
  `../../architecture/design-notes/tool-stall-watchdog-placement.md`.
- **RSS-threshold recycle** (`_rss_threshold_check`, config
  `session.watchdog_rss_max_mb`, default 0 via
  `DEFAULT_WATCHDOG_RSS_MAX_MB`; 0 disables): recycles non-busy
  sessions whose `/proc` process-tree RSS (MiB) exceeds the ceiling. Skips
  persistent (`_PERSISTENT_KEYS`) and `channel:`-prefixed keys — the same
  protected set as the idle sweep — and any session whose turn is in flight.
  A parent with attached sub-agent work — running or queued children, or a
  completion delivery still landing — is never recycled by the ceiling: with
  session sharing on those children run on the parent's runtime after its own
  turn ended, so the check consults `CleanupDeps.has_attached_subagents`
  (installed by `chat_utils.wire_session_subagent_probe()` from both
  `server.py` start paths via `SessionManager.set_subagent_probe`, built over
  the shared attached-children predicate) right before `reset`, and a probe
  that raises counts as attached. The same wrapper asks one further question
  before that coroutine probe: whether a completion injection is in flight
  (`CleanupDeps.has_pending_injection`), so the ceiling cannot recycle a runtime
  an already-committed turn is about to write into either. The recycle then asks
  that counter AGAIN once the probe returns, as the last statement before
  `reset`: the wrapper's read happens before the probe suspends, so an injection
  starting inside that await would otherwise be invisible on this path, and
  neither `skip_if_busy` nor `expect_session` can see it -- an injecting session
  holds no semaphore, and the injected turn resolves to the same object. That predicate is a COROUTINE
  (`chat_utils.subagents_attached_async`): its queued half reads the task store
  and this sweep runs on the gateway loop, so `set_subagent_probe` accepts an
  awaitable answer and the cleanup boundary awaits it; a sync probe (a double, a
  build with no queue) still answers straight away.
  The `/proc` parent→child map is built ONCE per tick off-loop
  (`_build_child_map` on the maintenance executor) and shared across
  candidate trees (`_rss_mb_from_tree`); resident pages are summed across the
  tree and converted to MiB once at the end. Measurement happens off-lock, so
  the victim's session object is captured at collection time and handed to
  `reset(expect_session=..., skip_if_busy=True)`, which re-verifies identity +
  not-busy atomically under the lock; a recycle that actually happened logs a
  warning, bumps `Stats().inc_session_cleaned()`, and fires the recycle
  callback (`set_recycle_callback` — mirrors the compact callback; wired by
  `dashboard/state.wire_session_recycle_callback()` from both `server.py`
  start paths to post a user-visible "session recycled" notice into
  `dashboard:` slots, tagged `meta={"kind": "compaction"}` so the [OPTIONS:]
  backward scan skips it). Idle/orphan sweeps do NOT fire the recycle
  callback. Linux-only measurement (`get_session_rss_mb` returns 0 elsewhere),
  so the feature is inert off-Linux.
- **Harness background work** (`CleanupDeps.provider_background_launch`,
  `HARNESS_BACKGROUND_WORK_HOLD_SECS` = 3600 s,
  `HARNESS_BACKGROUND_WORK_HARD_CEILING_FACTOR` = 2): a free semaphore only proves Kiro
  Crew's own prompt returned. Claude Code runs a backgrounded Bash command or a
  Workflow in the session's process tree after the prompt answers `end_turn`,
  and neither the semaphore nor the sub-agent probe can see it. claude-agent-acp
  reports the launch on the launching call's PostToolUse `tool_call_update`, as
  `_meta.claudeCode.toolResponse` carrying `backgroundTaskId` (Bash) or
  `status: "async_launched"` with a `taskId` (Workflow);
  `_dispatch.parse_background_launch` reads exactly those structured fields, and
  skips an `Agent`/`Task` launch because the adapter holds the prompt open until
  such a sub-agent settles. Only `AcpClient` — the transport that serves claude,
  the one harness whose adapter stamps the marker — keeps a per-session
  `BackgroundLaunchRecord` today (the `AcpSessionHandle` runtime serves only
  backends that never stamp `_meta.claudeCode`), never reset per turn, exposed as
  `background_launch()` -> `(seconds since, description)` through the provider
  chain. Nothing the adapter sends a client without its AIR extension marks the
  END of that work: a live capture shows a quiet run sends nothing between
  `end_turn` and the model waking to report it. So the hold is bounded by time.
  The RSS recycle, as its last synchronous read before `reset`, and the idle
  sweep, as a post-await re-judge on both axes, keep a session whose newest
  launch is inside the hold. Past it the ceiling applies again and the recycle
  notice stays the plain memory-limit reason: letting the recycle through past
  the hold presumes the launched work finished, and the record is never cleared
  while the process lives, so naming a launch from hours ago would be permanent
  noise. The record IS cleared by `AcpClient._reset_state` — the work dies with
  the process whose harness started it, so a respawn on the same client must
  not inherit the dead tree's hold. The hold cannot
  override memory without bound: every launch refreshes its clock, so a session
  that keeps launching work would renew it forever. Inside the hold the RSS
  recycle therefore still proceeds when the tree exceeds
  `rss_max_mb * HARNESS_BACKGROUND_WORK_HARD_CEILING_FACTOR` (2x — observed
  real workflow trees ran 2398-2641 MB against a 1536 MB ceiling, so
  the hold must survive those while still cutting off a runaway), and the
  notice still names the work. The idle sweep is not memory-driven, so its hold
  has no such ceiling. The probe is not fail-closed: a missing or unreadable
  answer is "nothing launched".

## APIs

| Method | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `start_pool(blocking=True)` | Pre-spawn warm + background sessions. `blocking=False` for non-blocking mode. |
| `get_or_create(key, agent=None, approval_policy="", speculative=False, speculative_resume=False, start_priority=BACKGROUND)` | Returns `(LLMProvider, is_new, resumed)`. `start_priority` orders a cold start in the start queues; only a caller a person is waiting on passes FOREGROUND ([acp-client](acp-client.md) § Session-start gate). Uses warm pool for new sessions (default agent only). Sessions with a resume mapping skip warm pool (cold start needed for `session/load`). A `reasoning_effort_override` is applied post-claim via `provider.change_effort` (updating `_effort_per_model` and the `cli.json` overlay write) rather than bypassing the warm pool, recovering pool-hit startup latency. Every decision is counted via `_record_pool_decision` (`kirocrew.session.pool.decision`) with the single disqualifying reason, so the pool's hit rate and the frequency of the `bypass_resume` case are observable. Non-default agents skip warm pool and resolve their model by precedence via `_model_fallback()` — caller model > per-agent pin > global default: `model=None` (defer to kiro's agent-JSON resolution) only when the agent pins its own model, otherwise the global default, unless that default is the `"auto"` sentinel (also `None`). The per-agent pin is resolved off the event loop via `run_in_executor` using `_resolve_named_agent_model`; blank agents inherit the global, and `kirocrew` is excluded (tracks the global). `approval_policy` is persisted on the new `_Session` — callers (e.g. subagent) pass parent policy so the session inherits it. `speculative=True` (eager spawn) pre-creates ahead of a real first turn: the one-shot `_Session.first_turn` observation — a single three-member `FirstTurnState` enum (`NOTHING_ARMED` / `FRESH` / `RESUMED`), so a resume marker on an already-claimed session is unrepresentable rather than forbidden by convention — is registered ARMED (`FRESH`) and never consumed by speculative callers, and a resumable key raises `SpeculativeResumeRefused` — unless `speculative_resume=True` (resume prefetch) opts in, in which case the speculative creator performs the `session/load` and registers the observation as `RESUMED` when the load restored the transcript. A load the provider would replace with a fresh session plus replay (Tool Search on, kiro backend, direct dashboard key — `resume_takes_tool_search_replay`, providers.md → Native-resume compatibility) never reaches this call speculatively: `chat_runner._eager_spawn` reads that predicate first and leaves the slot to its first turn, because such a load can only come back `resumed=False` and be refused after a full spawn. The observation is consumed in one read-then-clear by the first real claimant under the per-session semaphore (fast path and won-race path alike), with the returned booleans derived from it at the return boundary — so that turn observes `(is_new=True, resumed=True)` exactly as if it had resumed itself, preserving its history-injection decision. |
| `check_context_usage(key, provider)` | Returns %. Triggers compaction at configured threshold (default 70%), warns one `CONTEXT_WARN_MARGIN_PCT` below it. |
| `compact_if_needed(key)` | Awaitable twin of the `check_context_usage` trigger for callers that must not start their next turn while a compaction is pending (the task runner's between-steps check, #4686). Same gates in the same order — both entry points consume the shared `_compaction_gate_decision` ladder, the single owner of the gate order (its docstring documents each rung) — then AWAITS `_compact_session`. Returns the outcome: `"absent"`, `"reset"` (the settled verdict on the prior attempt was ineffective-and-still-critical and the promoted escalation reset the session here, awaited), `"cc_managed"` (checked before the threshold, mirroring `check_context_usage`), `"below_threshold"`, `"compact_unsupported"` (the provider names a backend outside `ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT`, so no `/compact` is dispatched and no semaphore is taken — checked AFTER the threshold so a declined backend keeps its per-turn usage log, #7812), `"unconfirmed"`, `"in_progress"`, `"cooldown"`, `"ok"`, `"busy"`, `"recycled"`, `"failed"`. A `"busy"` decline means a turn holds the semaphore — the caller leaves the session alone and retries later, never falls back to a direct `provider.compact()`. |
| `record_success(key)` / `record_failure(key)` | Circuit breaker tracking. |
| `release(key)` | Release per-session semaphore (must call in `finally`). |
| `cancel_current(key, *, wait_ack_timeout=0.0)` | Cancel in-flight operation without destroying session. Returns `CancelOutcome`. Default `wait_ack_timeout=0.0` preserves fire-and-forget behavior for internal callers (taskrunner, subagent, llm_helpers). |
| `stop_turn(key, *, force=False, preserve_queue=False, on_soft=None, on_hard=None)` | Cooperative stop with kill fallback. Returns `StopOutcome` (`"soft"`, `"hard"`, `"idle"`, or `"compacting"`). A cooperative stop on a session whose own automatic `/compact` turn holds it answers `"compacting"` BEFORE recording the Stop or clearing anything: cancelling that turn would fail the compaction and recycle the session. Otherwise records the Stop, clears the queue unless `preserve_queue`, then sends `session/cancel` and waits up to `agent.soft_stop_budget_secs`; falls back to `reset()` + eager respawn on timeout or error. `force=True` is never declined: it skips cancel and goes straight to hard kill. `on_soft`/`on_hard` callbacks fire before return. Callers with side effects of their own (a queue clear, a pending-file unlink, a task pop) probe `session_lifecycle.compaction_in_flight` first and run them only after an outcome other than `"compacting"`. |
| `reset(key, *, expect_session=None, skip_if_busy=False, clear_conversation=False)` | Kill session; returns `bool` (True iff a session was actually torn down). Does NOT delete session map entry (kiro-cli file persists for future resume). Optional guards evaluated atomically under the lock with the pop, used by the RSS-recycle watchdog: `expect_session` only resets if that exact session object still occupies the key (guards against recycling a reset+recreated session on a stale off-lock RSS reading); `skip_if_busy` skips when the current session's semaphore is held so a live stream is never cut mid-turn. `clear_conversation=True` additionally clears the native resume sid in the SAME event-loop tick as the pop (entry + channel bindings survive, as in `_recycle_held`) — used by the still-critical post-compaction escalation so the overflowed conversation is not reloaded, without a delayed clear ever erasing a racing successor's sid. |
| `discard_conversation(key)` | Kill session AND clear only the resume sid (`SessionMap.clear_sid`) — the map ENTRY survives, preserving Slack thread/channel linkage and the reverse thread→session index. The cleared sid is stashed as `discarded_sid` in the entry, so the discard is diagnosable and manually reversible (the native conversation persists on disk; only the pointer is dropped). Every path that empties `sid` in place records what it dropped, through one shared `_stash_and_clear_sid` — this discard, the provider switch, the startup prune and the per-read stale repair — because a history reader answers from that field and cannot tell which path wrote it, so a field written by only some of them holds a genuine id that is not the latest one. The next turn cold-starts a fresh native conversation instead of `session/load`-ing the old one. Used by the poisoned-conversation escalation in `chat_runner` (canary-verified backend rejection of a specific persisted conversation), by typed `IMAGE_FORMAT_UNSUPPORTED` recovery when a dashboard turn supplied no new attachment (the native history retains unsupported image bytes while the bounded Kiro Crew replay is text-only), and by the Slack / Discord / Telegram `/compact` failure recovery: the conversation is unusable but the session's channel identity must persist. This is the shape every HOUSEKEEPING teardown takes — `SessionMap.prune` refuses to delete an entry carrying a channel binding, and `_recycle_held` clears the sid for the same reason. Only an explicit user action (`destroy`) may remove a channel identity. Sits between `reset` (sid kept, resume expected) and `remove` (entry deleted, no resume). |
| `remove(key)` | Shut down a session but PRESERVE the session map entry — the kiro-cli session files remain on disk, so a future `get_or_create` restores the conversation losslessly via `session/load`. For revivable teardown (tab close, agent switch, idle kill). Permanent deletion is `destroy(key)`. |
| `destroy(key)` | Permanently remove the live provider, compaction override, and session-map entry. The map entry is deleted in the yield-free registry-pop span before the awaited end metric, so a dashboard slot cannot adopt the predecessor binding during that metric write. |
| `destroy_if(key, expected_generation, should_destroy, *, preserve_autocompact_override=False)` | Conditional permanent removal for the monotonic canonical-key generation captured by `session_generation(key)`. Under the manager lock it requires no current allocation/claim reservation, requires the generation to remain equal, requires the current session semaphore to be idle, then evaluates the synchronous slot-owner predicate immediately before the registry pop and yield-free session-map delete. Any reservation, generation mismatch (including absent→successor→absent ABA), busy session, false predicate, or predicate exception leaves provider, override, and map untouched. History deletion passes `preserve_autocompact_override=True` because another process can claim the same logical transcript; ordinary conditional and unconditional destroy keep clearing the old override. Returns whether destruction occurred. |
| `remove_if_unclaimed(key)` | Conditional `remove` for the resume-prefetch TTL: removes the session only if the one-shot `first_turn` observation is still armed (not `NOTHING_ARMED` — no real turn claimed it) AND the per-session semaphore is unheld, checked atomically under the manager lock. Preserves the session map (mirrors `remove`'s revivable shape), so the next focus or first message resumes normally. Returns `True` iff a session was removed. A claimant handed the session object but not yet holding the semaphore loses benignly: its re-validate fails and it cold-starts. |
| `close_all(drain_timeout=None)` | Pre-shutdown **drain** of in-flight turns (via `drain_active_turns`), then save all active session mappings, shut down every session, and drain the warm pool. `drain_timeout` bounds that drain (`None` = full default budget); a caller wrapping `close_all()` in its own hard deadline (Slack's restart wraps it in `wait_for(..., 5s)`) passes a smaller budget (e.g. `2.0`) so the kill path still fits inside the deadline. A cancel that fires mid-drain (outer deadline) **propagates** (CancelledError is deliberately not caught) so the caller's hard deadline stays honest; recovery of a still-held native-session lock is the next-startup orphan reaper's job. |
| `drain_active_turns(timeout=None)` | Best-effort co-operative drain that brings in-flight prompts to a safe turn boundary **before** teardown, so kiro-cli closes its native turn and releases its session lock (`~/.kiro/sessions/cli/<uuid>.json`) on the subsequent SIGTERM — otherwise the next gateway's `session/load` hits "active in another process" and the slot returns empty completions (the Make-Live empty-response incident, #200). For each registered session with an **unfinished** turn (native turn-done not yet acked — independent of cancel state, so an already-cancelled-but-not-acked turn is still drained), it issues a graceful `session/cancel` and waits (bounded) for the ack; a turn already cancelled (`cancel()` → `"no_turn"`) is waited on directly via `wait_turn_done`. The whole operation is bounded by `timeout` (`None` → `_DRAIN_ACTIVE_TURNS_TIMEOUT_SECS`, default 5.0s; internal cap is `timeout+1.0`); on timeout it logs and returns so the caller falls through to the SIGTERM-first kill path — never hangs teardown, never raises. `timeout <= 0` disables the drain. Returns the count of unfinished turns (observability/tests). Only registered user sessions are drained; the warm pool holds never-prompted processes. |
| `pause_turn_admission_for_update()` | Atomically pauses new turn admission under the session registry lock by setting the existing `_closing` gate and recording `update_pause_owned`. Returns `False` when real shutdown already owns `_closing`, or when a gateway stop is already signalled (`shutdown_event`, checked under the lock), so update logic cannot mask or replace shutdown and no installer starts into one. The pause covers both new `get_or_create` calls and already-issued leases reaching `begin_turn`. Channel callbacks claim a synchronous `reserve_inbound_callback()` before card or command handling; task-backed callbacks hold it until their handler task ends, while inline pollers scope it to one dispatch so the poll task does not keep updates busy forever. Admitted callbacks and pre-start client `_handler_tasks` are census-visible, while a claim refused after the pause writes the existing resend-notice route before any pre-turn side effect. Subagent, direct cron script/command, TaskRunner, and dynamic-workflow launchers read the same `admission_closed` state immediately before registering work, with no suspension before registration: a launch either registers before the pause and appears in the busy count, or is rejected after it. The subagent pump's two re-registrations read it too — the window refill (`_refill_apply`) and a resume reservation (`resume_reserve`) — because both would grow the busy count AFTER the census read even though the store already accepted that work: a hydrated row would only be refused by the spawn gate, and a resumed run would run on in a process about to be replaced. The gateway treats this boundary as apply-safe only when provider/Slack turns, every live dashboard `slot.task` (including pre-provider and remote-relay turns), shielded refusal writers, and all background workloads are idle. Subagent idleness is lifecycle-based rather than slot-based: queued/running work, unexpected-cancel recovery, shielded terminal reports, accepted follow-up watchers, one-shot orphan reconciliation, and detached state writers must all settle; the perpetual maintenance reaper is excluded. After apply, it drains callback tasks and refusal writers again; a timeout defers only the restart, reopens admission, and retries in five minutes without reapplying. A successful drain is followed immediately by `fence_update_restart()`, making any later refusal write synchronous through session teardown and the final drain, with no `await` between that drain and re-exec. Mandatory updates use a target-keyed ten-minute grace only for escalation logging; they still defer behind every active turn and background workload indefinitely. Automatic update preparation never calls `drain_active_turns()` and never cancels user work. |
| `resume_turn_admission_after_update()` | Releases `_closing` only when `update_pause_owned` is still true and no gateway stop is signalled (`shutdown_event`, checked under the lock); returns `True` only when admission actually reopened, and the gateway schedules its inbound-spool replay only then. `close_all()` revokes that ownership under the same lock before draining, so an update failure racing real shutdown cannot reopen admission. Used when automatic apply returns instead of replacing the process; during a shutdown (which stops the update first) the pause is kept so inbound turns keep being spooled. |
| `begin_turn(key)` | **Synchronous** pre-dispatch gate against the lease-dispatch race (#200 / Codex HIGH). A caller holds the per-session semaphore *lease* from `get_or_create` through the whole turn, but the native turn only opens on the first `provider.stream(...)` iteration; the `get_or_create` `_closing` gate cannot revoke a lease already issued before `close_all` set `_closing`. Callers (dashboard `chat_runner`, Slack handler, and structured Slack/Discord monitor adapters through `TurnDriver.closing_gate`) MUST call `begin_turn` synchronously — **no `await` between it and the `async for` stream drive** — so the `_closing` read and the stream's turn registration (`AcpClient.stream_events` clears `_turn_done` before its first `await`) form one yield-free span, strictly ordered w.r.t. `close_all`'s `_closing` set: the turn is either registered before the drain snapshot (and drained) or the caller aborts. Raises `SessionClosingError` (a `RuntimeError`) when closing; the caller's `finally` releases the lease. Deliberately NOT `async`/lock-guarded (an `await` would reopen the race). |

## Live config: the watcher drives `refresh_defaults`

The manager copies `session.*` and `agent.*` values out of `config.json` at
construction, so a write reaches those copies only if something pushes the new
value at them. The constructor registers that push on the process config watcher
(`live.subscribe("session", "agent", "watchdog", "agents", "workspaces",
"default_workspace", callback=self._on_config_change, name="SessionManager")`,
kept on
`self._config_sub`; the watcher holds the bound method weakly, so a manager a
test or a provider reload discards drops out of the registry on its own). Every
writer — the dashboard, `kirocrew config set`, `$EDITOR` — lands in the same
applier, so none of the behaviour below depends on which one wrote. No gateway
restart is needed for any of it.

`_on_config_change` first fails closed like the owned appliers: while any of its
six sections is degraded (a section the loader discarded holds DEFAULTS for it;
the whole-config marker alone does not gate it — see the config spec) it raises
`ConfigDeferred` for the changed paths and keeps what is in force, because
adopting defaults would rebuild the provider factory on the default model and
backend and drain the warm pool; the watcher retries each tick until the
document validates. Otherwise it does three things, in order:

- **Adopt the new config as `_cfg`, always.** Most fields under these prefixes
  are read off `_cfg` (or fresh from the loader) at their point of use, so the
  adoption IS the whole apply — `agent.soft_stop_budget_secs` per stop, and the
  cleanup loop's idle policy below. The adoption happens under `_lock`.
- **Route a factory-bound default through `refresh_defaults(cfg=change.new)`.**
  `_FACTORY_CONFIG_PATHS` lists the paths a rebuilt provider factory or a
  re-derived warm pool is the only way to honour: `agent.model`,
  `agent.reasoning_effort`, `agent.acp_backend`, `agent.role_efforts`,
  `agent.tool_search{,_min_pct,_min_tokens}`, `agent.sandbox`,
  `agent.sandbox_allow_no_isolation`, `agent.sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec`,
  `agent.member_acp_backend`, and `session.pool_size` / `pool_agent` /
  `pool_ttl_secs`. `refresh_defaults` is the **live-session-preserving** path —
  it rebuilds the factory, re-derives the pool and drains the warm pool, but
  never touches a registered session, so in-flight turns keep running and only
  NEW sessions see the new defaults. `reload_provider_factory` (which retires
  sessions built by the old factory) is not on this path.
  `session.eager_spawn` is deliberately absent: it is read live per spawn in
  `chat_runner`, so draining the pool for it would be pure churn.
- **Re-clamp the watchdog windows on every live handle** when the change touches
  `watchdog.*`, `agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs`, or any
  `agents.<name>.watchdog_*` key — see
  [acp-client.md](acp-client.md) for the fan-out and why it re-runs the loader
  per handle instead of copying seconds across.

`refresh_defaults(cfg=None)` takes an **already-loaded** config: the watcher
hands in the one it just loaded so the apply needs no second read, and `None`
(the request-handler callers) loads off-loop inside the fill lock, as before. It
re-derives the whole warm-pool shape, not just the factory — `_pool_size`
(clamped to `_MAX_POOL`, floored at 0), `_pool_agent` (falling back to
`agent.default_agent` when `session.pool_agent` is blank), `_pool_ttl_secs`
(floored at 0) and `_pool_cwd` — using the same clamps
`WarmSessionPool._state_from_owner` applies at construction, so a hot value can
never be a raw copy that bypasses them. `pool_ttl_secs` in particular was
re-adopted by no path before. `_pool_cwd` is `default_project_dir()`, which is
resolved from `default_workspace` and `workspaces`, so both are factory paths
and both prefixes are subscribed: a workspace edit re-derives the pool instead of
leaving a cwd-less subagent in the previous directory. The resolution reads the
config file and stats the workspace directory, so it runs in a worker thread
before `_lock` is taken, like the load itself.

Two more reads on this area follow config without a restart:

- `AcpRuntime._session_start_budget` prefers `live.snapshot()` over its
  per-runtime memo, keeping the same builtin floor, and falls back to the memo
  in a process with no watcher armed.
- `ContextBuilder`'s `{bot_name}` substitution reads
  `live.snapshot().agent.bot_name`, falling back to the value captured at
  construction when there is no snapshot or the live one is blank.

`acp/client.py`'s `resolve_prompt_timeout` already loads config per prompt
(`_effective_prompt_timeout_async`), so `agent.chat_turn_timeout_secs` needed no
applier — a raised turn budget is in force on the next prompt.

## Stop Orchestration

`stop_turn()` is the shared orchestration layer for every stop surface (dashboard Stop button, Slack `/kirocrew stop`, transport stop verbs). Sequence:

0. Decline a cooperative stop while the session's own automatic `/compact` turn
   holds it (`key in _compacting`, `force=False`): return `"compacting"` before
   anything below runs. Cancelling that turn would fail the compaction and recycle
   the session, so nothing is recorded and nothing is cleared; the caller tells the
   user and the compaction finishes on its own. `force=True` is never declined.
1. Record the Stop: `stop_requests[key] += 1` (per folded key, on
   `SessionLifecycleState`). This runs BEFORE anything is awaited so the
   dashboard runner's end-of-turn gates -- which may run the moment the
   provider's cancel lands -- already see it; `prev_turn_cancelled` is set only
   after the ack and is too late for them.
2. `clear_queue(key)` — queue drop is unconditional on first press (skipped
   with `preserve_queue=True`). Passing no ownership predicate is what makes the
   drop whole-session, which is what a Stop button press means. A per-sender
   stop verb passes one and drops only that principal's entries; see
   "Hard cancel: `/stop`" in `messaging.md`.
3. If `force=True`: skip cancel, go straight to hard kill (step 5).
4. Send `session/cancel` via `provider.cancel(wait_ack_timeout=budget)`:
   - `"acked"` → set `session.prev_turn_cancelled = True`, call `on_soft` callback, return `"soft"`.
   - `"no_turn"` → return `"idle"`.
   - `"timeout"` or `"error"` → fall through to hard kill.
5. Hard kill: `reset(key)` → fire-and-forget `_eager_respawn(key)` task → call `on_hard` callback → return `"hard"`.

### Session-scoped Stop record

`SessionManager.stop_generation(key)` reads the count from step 1 (0 for a key
never stopped). It exists because a channel-born dashboard slot runs its turns
on the channel's session (`effective_session_key` returns
`linked_session_key`), so a stop issued on the channel side reaches
`stop_turn()` and the provider cancel but never the slot's own `_stop_state`.
The dashboard runner snapshots the count at turn entry and its live Stop
signal (`_stop_pressed()`) treats any later change as a user Stop, next to the
slot's in-flight state and the slot's own `_stop_generation`; every
end-of-turn continuation gate (refusal recovery, Stop-hook continuation,
promise-only recovery, post-compaction continuation) reads that one signal.

Lifetime: the record is keyed by session key rather than stored on the
`_Session` object, so it survives the `reset()` a hard stop performs (a flag on
the session would vanish with the very turn it stopped). It is popped on the
teardown paths that end the key's conversation for good -- `remove()`,
`remove_if_unclaimed()`, `destroy()`, and the identity-sweep retirement --
beside the sibling per-key dicts. `cancel_current()` does NOT record a stop: it
is the host's own best-effort abort (queue drain, injection retry, run
teardown), not a person pressing Stop, and must not suppress a continuation
the way a Stop does.

### Cancelled-turn context restore

`_Session.prev_turn_cancelled` is a one-shot flag set on soft-cancel
success. The next prompt handler (dashboard `_run_chat`, Slack
`handle_message`) reads and clears it, then calls
`context.build_cancelled_turn_preamble(conversation_log, session_key)` to
re-inject the cancelled user prompt and partial assistant output. This is
necessary because kiro-cli discards cancelled turns from its own ACP
conversation log, so the LLM has no memory of the interrupted request.

### Interrupted-turn context restore

kiro-cli appends a prompt to `<sid>.jsonl` only once the model has answered
it, so a turn cut off by the serving process dying (a gateway restart, a crash,
a recycled runtime) is never written, and `session/load` restores the
conversation without it. A natively resumed session gets no Kiro Crew replay,
so the dashboard's Resume press (`_MANUAL_RESUME_MSG`) and the automatic
connection-lost and session-busy recoveries (`_CONN_RECOVER_MSG`,
`_BUSY_RECOVER_MSG`) would ask the model to finish a
request it cannot see. When either runs on a session that THIS turn resumed
natively (`is_new` and the provider has history), `_run_chat` prepends
`context.build_interrupted_turn_preamble(slot.messages, current=...)` to the
final prompt AFTER the egress scrub (its markers are registered in
`_STRUCTURAL_MARKER_RES`, so a copy planted in transcript or tool text is
neutralized; the restored payload is scrubbed by the builder): the
newest turn opener before the resume row (a user, nudge or sub-agent row, or an
`inject` whose kind is in `dashboard.state.TURN_OPENING_INJECT_KINDS` -- a cron,
app or synthesis delivery; a recovery inject such as an earlier Resume press is
walked past) plus the assistant text it had streamed, bracketed `[INTERRUPTED TURN …]` / `[END INTERRUPTED TURN]`. A cold
start that replays (Tool Search on a dashboard chat, a failed load) already
carries the turn and gets no preamble. A session whose ONLY turn was
interrupted is handled one layer down: `SessionMap.get` prunes a sid whose
`<sid>.jsonl` holds no turn, so that start replays instead of loading.

### Edit rewind context boundary

Dashboard Edit + Send replaces the ACP session and rebuilds context from the
retained canonical history. The discarded suffix is excluded from session
replay, stop recovery, and persisted-history context; stable memory, rules,
skills, and project context remain available.

The native conversation is discarded before the retained history rewrite, and
the cleared resume pointer is flushed durably before the rewrite is committed,
so a gateway restart cannot resurrect the discarded native session. If the
rewrite fails -- or the slot was concurrently rebound to another transcript
while it was in flight -- Edit + Send returns a 503 and restores the dashboard
slot, but it cannot restore the discarded native session; a later turn
cold-starts from the original persisted history instead of resuming it.
App-authenticated requests may rewind only a slot's own dashboard session:
a channel-linked slot is refused, because its effective session is a
conversation the app does not own.

**`edit-resend` is the same boundary, not a lighter one.** It truncates and
persists history exactly as rewind does, so it runs the same three-step sequence
— discard the native conversation, flush the cleared resume sid, then rewrite the
retained history — and refuses with `edit_resend_prepare_failed` /
`edit_resend_session_busy` / `edit_resend_save_failed` /
`edit_resend_slot_rebound` rather than reporting success on a boundary that did
not land. Its own error vocabulary is deliberate: a client must be able to tell
which endpoint refused without string-matching a sentence.

**A busy SESSION is not the same question as a busy slot.** `slot.running` tracks
only that slot's own task, while `discard_conversation` is a full teardown that
also releases the shared sub-agent runtime. So `edit-resend` applies the same
guard the sibling `reset-conversation` teardown applies before the same call, with
the same code: `slot_subagents_running` (409) via the shared
`chat_utils.subagents_attached_async` predicate, because the parent turn ends
before its children do. The predicate fails closed on an unreadable probe: unknown
children are not zero children. `skip_if_busy=True` on the discard remains the
atomic backstop for a turn admitted after these guards answered False.

Eight properties are load-bearing on this boundary, and each fails toward the
permissive answer if dropped. `edit-resend` carries all eight; the bullets name
the four where `rewind` does not yet, so nobody reads them as already shared:

- **The edited window is prepared on a copy, and the copy is SEVERED.**
  `copy.copy` is shallow, so reassigning `messages` alone leaves `_queue`,
  `_pending`, `_question_pending`, `_on_question_retired`, and `event` aliased to
  the live slot — and `_ChatSlot.append` writes through four of them. An
  un-severed copy therefore publishes the edited row to the live stream reader
  and announces the live question cards as retired *before* any refusal path can
  run, leaving a phantom row and a card-less "needs input" behind for an edit the
  server rejected. The commit is the one place the prepared `_pending`,
  `_question_pending`, `event` state and the retirement announcement become live.
- **The slot is reserved before the awaits.** `slot.running` derives from
  `slot.task` and the send path is not serialized on `slot._lock`, so a send
  arriving while a durable boundary is pending would otherwise see an idle slot
  and dispatch a competing turn that the commit then erases. The reservation
  publishes a dispatch task that runs the turn only on commit; on abort it hands
  a send it diverted to the queue to the canonical successor dispatch, so nothing
  is stranded. An entry queued *before* the reservation keeps its own trigger.
- **The commit re-checks its target on every path**, success included, through
  ONE predicate so no path can check a different subset. Three axes move
  independently across the awaits: the **transcript key** (a cron or workflow
  injection re-links the slot; the snapshot froze the old routing, so the save's
  own `expected_history_key` guard cannot see the live slot move and only this
  loop-side check can), the **slot object** (a close-and-recreate under the same
  name is a different conversation that leaves the transcript key unchanged, so
  only object identity catches it), and the **dispatch reservation** (if
  something else has taken `slot.task`, committing would run this handler's turn
  alongside whatever now owns the slot — two concurrent turns writing one
  window). Any of the three refuses with a retryable 503.
- **The commit predicate does not cover the durable write; the CLOSE path orders
  it instead.** Every call to the commit predicate above happens AFTER the save
  has settled, so for the file it is a post-mortem: it can refuse the live commit
  and the dispatch, and it cannot un-truncate a transcript that has already been
  replaced. The truncated window is frozen against ONE slot incarnation, and a
  same-name close-and-recreate can be published inside the executor wait, after
  every check the handler can run on the loop. Such a recreate resuming the same
  conversation leaves the transcript key unchanged, so `expected_history_key`
  waves it through.
  `chat_persistence._save_slot_to_history` does accept `expected_slot_name` and
  re-reads `state._slots` under the transcript lock before writing, which is what
  the `regenerate` and `switch-variant` saves pass. That check is necessary but
  not sufficient, and no caller should be read as closing the race: the harm does
  not need the replacement published before the check, only that it READS the
  file after the write commits. The save holds the per-session lock across its
  whole read-modify-write, so a replacement published during the write waits and
  then hydrates from the truncated content.
  Closing it needs slot publication ordered against the persistence commit, and
  that ordering exists at the retraction that hands a reused name to a
  replacement: **`close_slot`**. It fences the slot with `begin_close`, waits for
  the slot's registered **guarded writes** — a truncating save, meaning one
  carrying an authorized `expected_history_key` — and only then pops the name.
  The registry `slot._guarded_history_writes` holds the writes' executor FUTURES,
  not a count, because a count released in an awaiter's `finally` reads zero the
  moment that awaiter is cancelled while its worker thread runs on to the rename.
  `save_slot_off_loop` registers every guarded write it dispatches;
  `chat_rewind.api_chat_slot_rewind` calls `register_guarded_history_write` on
  its own `asyncio.to_thread` save, which is the one truncating write that does
  not go through that helper.
  A truncating save is one that rewrites the window rather than appending to it:
  it passes an explicit `messages` snapshot, or `rewrite=True`. EVERY one of them
  carries an authorized transcript key, the fork's pending-rewrite flush
  (`chat_fork`) included — without the key a truncating save skips the fence, the
  registration AND the in-lock routing re-read, leaving it less ordered against a
  retraction than the ones that are fenced. The enumeration is read from the
  syntax tree by a test, so the population cannot grow quietly.
  A registered write must never be cancelled by its own handler. Cancelling it
  makes the task DONE, the done callback drops it from the registry, and the
  worker thread runs on to the rename with nothing left to order against it --
  the same hole, reached from the cancellation path instead of the dispatch one.
  So every await on a registered task is shielded, including the awaits in a
  cancellation drain, and each drain is bounded (`_SAVE_DRAIN_ATTEMPTS`) so a
  cancel storm cannot spin. A task that never settles stays pending and stays
  registered, which is what the close needs.
  The periodic writer honours the same fence: `flush_slot_now` returns without
  writing while `slot.is_closing`, and leaves `_dirty` armed. A fenced slot is
  still the occupant of its name until the pop, so the five-second pass still
  visits it, and that write is not a registered guarded write, so the
  retraction's wait cannot see it — a tick landing between fence and pop would
  overwrite whatever adopts the name next. A close that completes persists the
  window itself through its archival save; a close that is abandoned lets the
  next pass write the owed value.
  That fence is necessary but NOT sufficient, for the same reason the whole
  ordering exists: it is read on the flush executor thread while the retraction
  runs on the loop, and the write reaches the transcript lock only after the
  snapshot, routing and retention stretch. So the periodic save also passes
  `expected_slot_name`, which decides INSIDE the lock with no await before the
  write. It matters more here than elsewhere: a periodic save is a full metadata
  rebuild and does not request the `rows_only` deferral that keeps another
  holder's folder, title and tag.
  That in-lock refusal keeps the write OWED (`_keep_owed_after_refusal`, kept with
  the save's other refusal rules in `dashboard/slot_persistence/write_guards.py`),
  for the reason its own docstring gives: `flush_slot_now` clears `_dirty` on any return
  that did not raise, so a guard refusing without re-arming erases the only
  in-memory witness of an edit it never wrote. An in-place edit has no
  substitute witness — the popped slot is outside the registry the periodic pass
  walks, and its window length matches disk.
  A refusal is a DEFERRAL, not a loss: it marks the slot `_dirty` so the
  periodic flush retries the write once the fence is down. That matters because
  the metadata-only mutations — a recreate's title, a folder filing, a tag, a pin
  — save with `force=True`, set no `_dirty` of their own, and publish on the
  acknowledged edit without reading the return; and a close can raise the fence
  and then leave the slot live, since it refuses on a breached wait and the sweep
  raises and releases the fence around a deferral. Without the arming, an edit
  landing in that window is dropped and the old value returns after a restart.
  The pair is decidable in BOTH directions because each dispatch seam re-reads
  the fence with no suspension between the read and the registration: either the
  fence is up and the write refuses, or the write is registered and the close
  waits for it. A write that outlasts the 5-second ceiling **refuses the close**
  (`SlotCloseError` code `history_write_running`); the tab stays open and
  retryable rather than having its name retracted with a thread still writing.
  `close_slot` is the only retraction that WAITS, because it is the only one
  obliged to finish — the person asked for it.
  The fence itself is a DEPTH, not a flag, because two retractions can overlap
  on one slot: the close suspends inside its wait and the sweep can reach the
  same slot meanwhile. With a shared flag, whichever finished first cleared the
  fence for both, and the other's remaining awaits ran unfenced — which is the
  window the fence exists to close, since the dispatch-seam re-reads read
  exactly this value. Counting means each holder releases only its own
  acquisition; `cancel_close` floors at zero so an unmatched release cannot make
  a later `begin_close` read as not-closing. The sweep additionally skips a slot
  that is already closing, BEFORE raising its own fence, since after that it
  could not tell its acquisition from the other holder's.
  The bulk stale-slot sweep pops each slot itself and is fenced too, but it
  DEFERS instead of waiting. Staleness is judged from last recorded activity,
  and a truncating save's HANDLER can be in flight far longer than its worker
  thread — a rewind on a conversation nobody has touched for days is admitted,
  awaits its native teardown, and only then dispatches — so a stale slot can
  carry a guarded write. A pending guarded write is itself proof the tab is not
  idle, whatever its timestamps say, so the sweep reads the registry
  SYNCHRONOUSLY behind the fence and leaves such a slot for the next sweep,
  reporting it in `failed`. Waiting there would be worse than useless: the
  handlers that produce a guarded write publish a task on the same slot in the
  same breath, so a wait would hold the sweep open exactly while the tab is
  being edited and the pop after it would cancel that turn. Deferring removes
  that window by construction, and the fence is what makes the synchronous
  read sound: with it up no new guarded write can be dispatched, so an empty
  reading stays empty through the pop. There is deliberately NO await between
  that fence and that pop. The sweep also releases the fence itself where a
  failed archive restores the slot, since it has no `close_slot` wrapper to do
  that for it.
  Residuals, deliberately: `_materialise_slot_from_history` publishes a slot
  rebuilt from disk rather than retracting a live one, so it keeps only the
  narrower in-lock `expected_slot_name` re-read. The history-delete pop in
  `handlers/sessions.py` needs no wait for a different reason: `delete_session`
  unlinks under the SAME `_locked` region the save takes, so the **delete-won
  guard** refuses the write outright instead of resurrecting the transcript.
  Making registration automatic at the `_save_slot_to_history` layer, so a new
  truncating caller cannot opt out, and making `pop_slot` an enforced chokepoint
  rather than a facade, are tracked in issue #12090.
- **The periodic dirty-slot flush is excluded for the whole rewrite.** Because
  the live slot keeps the full window until the commit, a flush tick can snapshot
  that stale window, block behind the rewrite on the per-session history lock,
  and then write the snapshot back on top — restoring every message the rewrite
  just discarded. `edit-resend` therefore saves through
  `chat_persistence.save_slot_off_loop` (with `expected_history_key`, and
  `best_effort=False` so a failure reaches its 503 rather than being swallowed
  and re-armed as a dirty retry) instead of a bare `asyncio.to_thread`. That
  helper raises `slot._metadata_persist_inflight` around the write and lowers it
  in a `finally` — the flag `flush_slot_now` already honours to keep the unpinned
  periodic writer off a slot with a guarded write pending. Shielding the
  *wrapper* rather than the inner future is what keeps the exclusion held: a
  cancellation reaching the shield leaves the coroutine running, so its `finally`
  cannot release the flag early.
  That counter and `_guarded_history_writes` are different mechanisms with
  different consumers and are not interchangeable: the counter answers
  `flush_slot_now`, whose question is whether the periodic writer may start, and
  an awaiter's cancellation lowering it early is the correct answer there. The
  close's question is whether the worker THREAD has returned, which only the
  future can answer.
- **The cancellation drain survives REPEATED cancellation.** The worker thread
  cannot be interrupted, so once the rewrite starts it lands whether the handler
  lives or not; the handler therefore has to learn the outcome and commit to
  match. `CancelledError` is a `BaseException`, so a second cancellation — a
  gateway shutdown reaching a handler already unwinding from a client disconnect
  — is not absorbed by an `except Exception` and a bare `await` on the save task
  abandons a landed rewrite. `edit-resend` re-shields the drain a bounded number
  of times (`_SAVE_DRAIN_ATTEMPTS`) and reads the outcome off the **settled**
  task rather than awaiting it, so a cancel landing between the two cannot lose
  it. Giving up leaves the live slot untouched, which is the safe half of the
  desync. **`rewind` still drains with a bare `await`**, so it remains exposed.
- **A row that arrives during the boundary is carried, not replaced away.**
  `workflow_inject` and `cron_inject` append through `append_and_surface` /
  `slot.append` on the event loop and take no `slot._lock`, so a completion
  landing mid-boundary reaches the live window while the boundary holds the lock.
  A wholesale `slot.messages = prospective_slot.messages` drops it, and the
  rewrite save cannot restore it because a rewrite deliberately skips the
  cross-process-append scan (`collect_foreign = not rewrite`) — leaving the row
  in neither the window nor the file. `edit-resend` therefore carries arrived
  rows (identified by row object, since the window front can be trimmed and a
  restore-path row has no `meta.mid`) onto the committed window and pending
  queue. Appending them after the prospective window is the correct order, not
  merely a convenient one: `monotonic_transcript_ts` only ever moves a row
  forward, so an arrived row can never be stamped *earlier* than the edited one —
  but it can be stamped **identically**, because on a coarse clock (Windows ticks
  in ~15.6 ms steps) both appends read the same instant, and list order is what
  separates that tie. Its question map is **retired in place** rather than adopted or
  intersected: the commit deletes exactly the ids the edit retired, so a card answered
  during the boundary stays retired (the answer pops it from the live dict) and a card
  raised during the boundary survives (an intersection against the frozen copy would
  erase it). A carried row reaches disk
  the ordinary way — the commit sets `_dirty`, so the next periodic flush writes
  the merged window — and deliberately **not** through a second guarded save
  after the commit: no await may sit between the commit and the dispatch release
  (see the next bullet), so that write is not available without paying a worse
  failure. **`rewind` now applies the same delta commit**: it carries arrived rows in
  both the window and the pending queue, drops a row the client already drained rather
  than requeueing it, and retires question ids in place. The identity sets keep the
  pre-await rows RETAINED, because an `id()` is only an identity while something holds
  a reference and a cap trim would otherwise let a freed row's address be reused by an
  arrival. The other rewrite-save callers (`regenerate`, `fork`) are **deliberately
  still open** to the injected-row loss; closing them belongs with the shared boundary
  contract rather than one endpoint, and the fixed subset is exactly `rewind` and
  `edit-resend`.
- **The commit and the dispatch release are separated by no await.** Once the
  live slot has adopted the truncated window, the reserved dispatch is armed and
  only `dispatch_ready.set()` in the handler's `finally` is left to run. An await
  in that gap lets a cron or workflow completion rebind the slot, and the
  released dispatch then runs the edited prompt against ANOTHER conversation —
  and the commit-target fence cannot rescue it, because refusing after the live
  slot has adopted the truncated window would leave a truncation with no turn.
  So post-commit work is left to the next periodic flush rather than awaited
  here. **`rewind` still awaits its orphan-session cleanup in that gap**, so it
  remains exposed.
- **App ownership is authorized through the shared gate**
  (`slot_ownership.deny_app_slot_session_access`, plus `_reauthorize_after_await` across the
  body-read await), because discarding a native conversation is a destructive
  capability. It authorizes the `_app` binding, the effective SESSION key, and
  the TRANSCRIPT key, so a channel-linked slot and an unbound channel-origin slot
  are both covered by one check rather than a per-endpoint link test. Denials are
  404, not 403 — indistinguishable from a missing slot (anti-enumeration); the
  real reason is in the SEL audit log.

### Eager Respawn

After a hard kill, `_eager_respawn(key)` calls `get_or_create(key)` in a background task so the next user message finds a warm session. On failure, logs at debug and does nothing — the next message triggers `get_or_create` again via the normal path.

## Session Resume (SessionMap)

Persistent mapping of `session_key → kiro_session_id` stored at
`~/.kiro/crew/session_map.json`. Enables `session/load` to restore full
kiro-cli conversation history when a session is recycled.

**Only long-lived conversational sessions are mapped.** Stateless sessions
(cron, subagent, taskrunner, channel, secretary, side, heartbeat/background,
`wf-author:` workflow authoring, and `wf-pool:` warm workflow-pool workers) are
excluded via `_STATELESS_PREFIXES`. A `wf-author:` session is also explicitly
destroyed after each authoring attempt, which shuts down its provider, removes its
registry entry, and deletes any stale map entry; stateless classification prevents
resume lookup or persistence during acquisition. The `wf-pool:` prefix keeps
per-run pooled workers (workflows/agent_pool.py) from persisting a session_map entry
or resuming a prior transcript — their hard-reset fallback must hand the next task
a clean session, never a `session/load` replay of the previous task's conversation.
The `side:` prefix is included so
`/side` conversations never resume across KiroCrew restarts — each cold-start
triggers `is_first_turn=True` in `build_side_message` which re-seeds the
parent snapshot + accumulated side history.
The `thread:` prefix (a reply thread on a crewmate chat message,
[history](history.md#reply-threads-on-crewmate-chat-messages-dashboardchat_threadspy))
is included for the same reason: `build_thread_message` re-seeds the whole
envelope on a cold session.

**Lifecycle:**
- `get_or_create()`: looks up mapping → if found and `.json` file exists,
  sets `resume_session_id` on the ACP client and skips warm pool. After
  `ensure_ready()`, saves the new `session_key → session_id` mapping.
- `reset()`: does NOT delete mapping — the kiro-cli session file persists
  on disk. Next `get_or_create` will try `session/load`.
- `remove()`: deletes mapping — explicit tab delete, no resume expected.
- `close_all()`: saves all active mappings before killing processes.
- `start_pool()`: prunes stale entries (files deleted by kiro-cli GC).

### Asking for a fresh conversation on a slot that stays open

`POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/reset-conversation` drops one slot's resume pointer
through the LIVE manager (`discard_conversation`), so its next turn cold-starts
instead of `session/load`-ing the accumulated conversation. The slot stays open,
the transcript stays on disk, and the map ENTRY survives with its channel
linkage.

This closes a gap rather than adding a capability: resume is key-driven and a
slot key is stable by design, which is correct for a tab reopened later and wrong
once a long-lived conversation has drifted, filled up, or outlived what it was
about. The only reachable way to break the link was `DELETE /api/sessions/{key}`,
which destroys the record in order to reset the pointer — so "start over" and
"erase this" were the same button.

**`replay` is what the caller means by "fresh", and it has to be asked for.**
Clearing the sid stops the provider resuming its own conversation — and "the
provider has no history" is precisely the condition that makes the next cold
start rebuild one from `conversation_log` as a `[CONVERSATION HISTORY]` block
(`chat_runner`, injected OUTSIDE the capped session context). So the two
mechanisms work against each other by construction: the caller discards the
conversation and the next turn is handed a reconstruction of it. Measured on one
app-owned session, that replay was 80,359 characters — 76% of the first turn's
injected context, and most of what discarding the conversation was meant to
reclaim. `discard_conversation(key, replay=False)` records a ONE-SHOT
suppression, consumed at the replay gate inside the cold-start branch so a warm
turn cannot spend it, and the route threads it from an optional `replay` field on
the request body. The default is `True`, which keeps every existing caller and
the dashboard's own copy ("Conversation history is preserved — your next message
starts a fresh process") true. Only the RE-INJECTION is suppressed: the
transcript is untouched, so the conversation stays readable in the dashboard and
on disk.

The flag cannot live on the session object the way `needs_context_reinjection`
does, because `discard_conversation` POPS that session — the decision is made by
the turn that tears the conversation down and acted on by the next turn, which
builds a new one. It is therefore a manager-level set, process-scoped on purpose:
a gateway restart also cold-starts the session, but there the replay is
legitimate, since nobody asked for a fresh conversation and re-anchoring is what
that surface has always done. Every teardown path that already clears the
compaction cooldown clears it too (`reset`, `remove`,
`retire_kiro_identity_sessions`, `remove_if_unclaimed`, `destroy`, and
`close_all`), because slot keys ARE reused and a leaked flag would starve the
NEXT holder of that key of its re-anchor.

Slot-key reuse is also why the dashboard close/teardown path re-checks identity
after it pops the slot. Both `close_slot` (shared by `api_chat_slot_delete` and
session-control's `close_target`) and `api_chat_slots_cleanup` pop `name` out of
`state._slots` and then run several AWAITS — cancel the task,
`save_slot_off_loop(..., closed=True)`, `sessions.remove(_history_key_for(name))`.
Across that window a concurrent same-key recreate (a `POST /api/chat`, or the
`session_close` MCP verb) can mint a REPLACEMENT slot under the same key, reusing
the same history key and the same session. Because both sites still hold the
popped object (`slot` / `removed`), a synchronous, race-free discriminator is
available, and there are TWO of them because the destructive steps do not all
answer to the same owner.

`_slot_still_ours(state, name, <popped>)` is the KEY-scoped one. It asks whether a
DIFFERENT object now owns the key — an absent key is the ordinary post-pop state of
every close, so `None` counts as still ours; reading it as "our object owns the key"
would make the guard fire on every close and skip the very teardown it guards. It
governs the two steps whose resource IS the key: `sessions.remove` (whose argument
is `_history_key_for(name)`, the session an unbound replacement runs on) and the
failure arms' restores (`state._slots[name] = slot` / `= removed`), which run only
when the key is still free or still the popped object and so never clobber a live
replacement. Cleanup's `archived` report is key-scoped too, and stays key-scoped:
it names slot keys, so a key with a live holder is never listed however its
transcript ended up.

`_replacement_shares_transcript(state, name, <popped>)` is the TRANSCRIPT-scoped
one, and it is what governs the `closed=True` save — because that save's argument
is not the key. It targets `slot_history_key(slot)`, so a slot carrying a
`linked_session_key` (channel-, cron- or workflow-born) writes the LINKED
transcript while a replacement minted by a plain `get_or_create_slot(name)` — what
`POST /api/chat` and the `session_close` verb take — is unbound and writes
`dashboard:{name}`. Same key, two files, so key identity cannot decide this step:
yielding the archive to a replacement that shares nothing would leave the
original's own transcript with no `closed` flag, and `channel_slots._close_stands`
reads an absent flag as "the user never dismissed this", so the reconcile pass
resurfaces the tab that was closed. The predicate therefore compares FILE identity
(`transcript_stems` on both sides) rather than key strings: `history._safe_key`
folds `slack:<ts>` and the `slack_<ts>` stem onto one `.jsonl` and a pre-migration
thread still resolves to its bare `thread_ts` stem, and the two errors are not
symmetric — over-reporting "shared" merely declines an archive the next close will
make, while under-reporting stamps `closed` on a file a live slot is writing.

When the replacement DOES share the transcript, the archive and the session
teardown are both skipped. The original was already popped and cancelled, so the
close is effectively complete for it: `close_slot` RETURNS rather than raising
`SlotCloseError`, which is what makes both its callers report success, and cleanup
takes its `continue` without counting the key archived. When it does NOT share the
transcript the archive runs normally on the original's own file and only the
key-scoped steps yield.

The `note_slot_closed` tombstone (below) still fires before these awaits for the
reconcile reader; it is NOT the vehicle for either guard, which are pure post-pop
re-checks confined to the two teardown paths.

What both guards cover is the WIDE window, not the durable write. `save_slot_off_loop`
reaches its commit through the process-wide default executor, so a recreate can
still land between the last synchronous check and the in-lock write, leaving
`closed=True` on a key a live replacement holds. That residual is what an unguarded
close carries as well, and the row is the same one a plain sequential
close-then-reopen of a reused key produces: `closed`/`closed_at` are in
`SLOT_OWNED_META_KEYS`, so the replacement's next full save drops them, and
`api_chat_slot_resume` compensates a stale flag with an in-lock compare-and-clear
(`clear_closed(..., only_if_closed_before=...)`). Closing it AT the commit needs an
ownership predicate evaluated inside `_locked(history_key)` on the write AND on the
resume's read-then-clear — a durable-metadata contract change rather than a
loop-side ordering one, so it is deliberately not what these two teardown paths do.

Yielding to a replacement carries four obligations, and they exist because the
state a close compensates is not all scoped the same way.

- **Key-scoped state moves with the key.** `state._restricted_keys` holds
  `dashboard:{name}` — a SESSION KEY, not a slot identity — and
  `_is_restricted_session` tests that set BEFORE it looks at the slot. So every exit
  of either teardown owes one postcondition, which is what
  `_resettle_restricted_key(state, name)` IS: the key is marked iff the slot
  currently AT `name` is restricted, an absent key counting as unrestricted. All six
  exits go through it rather than through a bare `discard` — the ordinary close
  (where the key is gone, so the marker drops and the next holder is not starved),
  and every exit that hands the key to a replacement (where it is re-derived from
  the REPLACEMENT). Re-derived, never blindly discarded: a replacement that is
  itself restricted keeps the marker, since dropping it is the fail-OPEN direction.
  Skipping it on a hand-over gives a persistent replacement an incognito original's
  403 on every memory, artifact and mcp-apps call for as long as that tab lives.
- **Slot-scoped compensation is coupled to the restore.** The failure arms owe the
  ORIGINAL two rollbacks, and both are conditional on the original getting its key
  back — not on the original merely existing. The nudge loop already is, through
  `_restore_slot_nudge_loop`'s own `state.get_slot(name) is slot` admission check.
  `notify_slot_close_undone` is coupled the same way rather than gated on
  `slot._app` alone: with a replacement on the key there is no tab to put back, so
  the dismissal DID happen for the original, and resuming the app's worker re-arms
  an autonomous crew whose `slot_key` its watchdog resolves with a bare
  `state.get_slot(...)` and no ownership test — handing the auto-approve grant, and
  then an unbounded nudge clock, to the user-owned replacement. Leaving the pause is
  the same answer the pre-save guard gives from the identical state, and it is a
  first-class visible one (a `paused_reason` row with a resume control). The bulk
  archive has no sibling here: it deliberately never calls `notify_slot_closed`, so
  it has no app dismissal to take back.
- **The original's unpersisted content is owed to its transcript, not to the
  original's slot object.** A hand-over exit stops referencing the popped
  slot, and `_flush_dirty_slots` iterates exactly `state._slots`, so an
  unreferenced slot has NO retry path: anything past its last commit —
  `messages[_disk_window_len:]`, plus a note the bulk path is still holding in
  `_deferred_notes` — would simply cease to exist from this gateway's own
  delivery paths. (Since #4093 a held note also has a durable copy in the
  slot's metadata line, so a dropped hold is re-delivered after the NEXT
  restart rather than lost outright — but deferring an acknowledged note to a
  hypothetical future restart is not delivery, so the hand-over drain below
  is still what honors it in this lifetime. One version-skew caveat: the
  retirement invariant holds only for gateways that stamp `meta.noteId` on
  delivered rows. An older gateway carries `deferred_notes` as unowned
  metadata, its flush stamps no id and its save retires nothing, so a
  downgrade-deliver-reupgrade cycle replays already-delivered notes as
  duplicates — bounded harm, and the chosen at-least-once direction, but the
  invariant silently does not hold across versions.) The pre-save
  exits need no store failure to reach it either; they return before the save is
  attempted, in a window that opens while a turn is in flight. So every hand-over
  exit routes through `_persist_handover_tail(state, name, slot)`, which flushes
  held notes into the window and writes it with **`closed=False`**. Those rows
  belong on the ORIGINAL's own transcript whether or not the replacement shares it;
  what must not happen is the archive flag and the session teardown, not the write.
  The
  target is `slot_history_key(slot)` and never a derived `dashboard:<slot>` — the
  forced save resolves its own target the same way and REFUSES a write whose
  `expected_history_key` names a different transcript, so the derived form would
  make the drain a silent no-op for every cron-, channel- or workflow-linked slot
  and would name a row-less file in the failure log. The write is non-destructive
  against the replacement's rows in both directions: `_save_slot_to_history`'s
  foreign-append scan carries through every on-disk line the saved window does not
  represent, so rows a replacement already committed survive. The METADATA line is
  a different matter and is not the drain's to move, so the write is `rows_only`.
  `_save_slot_to_history` is otherwise authoritative for `SLOT_OWNED_META_KEYS` and
  REBUILDS that line from whichever slot it is handed, so a default save here would
  revert a title, folder, tag set or pin the replacement had already published onto
  the shared transcript (`POST /api/chat/slots` persists a folder and a pinned title
  at birth) — silently undoing an acknowledged edit, and for a tab nobody types in
  again undoing it for good, so the next restart resurrects the dismissed tab's name
  and filing. `rows_only` keeps the on-disk value for every one of those fields and
  narrows this write's ownership to `ROWS_ONLY_OWNED_META_KEYS`: the file's identity
  and accounting, which every writer maintains and which the save carries forward
  from disk anyway. The set it defers,
  `ROWS_ONLY_DEFERRED_META_KEYS`, is named in full rather than derived as
  `SLOT_OWNED_META_KEYS - ROWS_ONLY_OWNED_META_KEYS`, because that difference
  under-approximates: the slot save also writes fields that DESCRIBE an owned one
  without being owned themselves, and a title's provenance and refresh budget
  (`title_origin`, `title_refresh_mark`) travel WITH the title rather than with the
  writer. Deferring the title while keeping those commits a line matching neither
  slot — read back beside another slot's title they either unlock the background
  refresh on a name the user typed by hand or lock a generated name out of refresh
  permanently — so they are deferred with it. `created_by` and `origin` are the same
  shape with AUTHORIZATION rather than presentation behind them, so they are deferred
  too: `created_by` is what session-control's member ownership boundary reads and is
  meaningless without the `mode` deferred beside it, and `origin` must round-trip with
  the deferred `app` because the pair decides `slots:user` visibility and the
  unattended approval window. Both describe the SLOT, so on a transcript with a live
  holder the holder's are the true ones — and deferring them fails CLOSED on a line
  that carries neither, since an absent `created_by` denies and an absent `origin`
  restores to the sentinel the rehydrate paths already treat as unattributed. The
  conversation's own MONOTONE once-flags (`auto_tagged`, `human_seen`,
  `channel_origin`, `channel_folder_filed`) are set and never cleared, so two writers
  on one transcript cannot disagree about them in a way that outlives the pair; they
  stay as written. Deferring to disk is deliberately not
  the same as deriving the line from the replacement — a recreate that published
  nothing has no metadata to protect, and re-deriving from it would ERASE a real
  title and filing the two slots' shared conversation has; leaving the line alone is
  what gets both directions right with one write. **The deferral is conditional on
  there actually being another writer to defer to**, and the line's `tab_id` — minted
  per slot object, stamped by every save — is the evidence: the flag holds fields
  back only on a line ANOTHER slot published, and a line this slot published itself
  (or no line at all) takes the ordinary rebuild. Without that test the flag would
  cost the original its own uncommitted metadata: a rename, re-file, tag or pin is
  acknowledged the instant it lands in memory and persists on a later `_dirty`
  flush, and the drain runs past the pop, where no flush will ever visit that slot
  again. The two errors are not symmetric, so unprovable ownership defers: a
  deferred edit of this slot's was never committed, while a rebuild over a live
  holder's line reverts what it already published and nothing rewrites that for a
  replacement nobody types in again. `closed`/`closed_at` are deferred on the same
  asymmetry, and the drain is open-shaped without being un-closing: on another
  holder's line a `closed` flag is that holder's own DISMISSAL, so erasing it would
  resurface a tab the user put away — permanently, since the holder that wrote it is
  popped too — and re-arm the channel reconciler on it, while leaving a stale flag
  costs nothing durable, because the live holder owns those keys on its next full
  save. The only path that clears a stale flag from outside the holder is the resume
  route, and it clears one only when it can prove the close predates its own
  boundary (`clear_closed(..., only_if_closed_before=...)`, compared inside the
  store's lock), for exactly this reason: an unconditional clear reopens a
  replacement the user closed. A rows-only save carries no such boundary, so
  clearing a stale flag is instead the job of the `tab_id` fallback above: on a line THIS slot
  published there is no other holder's dismissal to lose, so the ordinary rebuild
  runs and the open-shaped write erases it. The failure arms take the same route in place of the
  restore they skip: a store that rejected the `closed=True` write can still
  accept the next one, and a lock lost to the recreate is exactly that case.
- **A drain that fails is reported, not swallowed.** `_persist_handover_tail`
  returns a named result: `rows_committed` says whether rows were owed and
  reached disk, `prompts_lost` counts the durable-eligible queued prompts whose
  only copy dies with the popped slot. The result is a tuple and therefore
  always truthy, so callers read `rows_committed` rather than testing the
  result itself — and every caller honours it, because this frame is the last
  reference to those rows, so nothing will retry and
  nothing else will ever report them. Both PRE-SAVE hand-over exits therefore turn
  a failed commit into their path's own failure: `close_slot` raises
  `SlotCloseError(code="history_save_failed")` (the same code as an ordinary failed
  archive — from the caller's side it is one thing, a close whose history write did
  not land) and cleanup adds the key to `failed`. There is nothing to roll back on
  either exit, so the report IS the whole remedy; a 200 there would claim durability
  the close does not have. The two FAILURE-arm drains need no branch of their own:
  those arms already end in `SlotCloseError` / `failed.append(name)`, so a lost tail
  reaches the caller regardless, and the drain only decides whether the rows
  survived. Every failure is also logged with the exact row count, which is the only
  report anything in the process can still make about the rows themselves. A
  non-zero `prompts_lost` additionally posts a dashboard notification naming the
  slot and the count — never the prompt text, which may belong to a restricted
  session — because the gateway log is not reachable by the person whose words
  were dropped. Survival is judged by who writes the durable line next, not by
  the slot's own persistence signature: a live transcript-sharing holder
  rebuilds the shared line on its every full save, so an owed entry survives a
  hand-over only when that holder's own queue carries it (a rehydrated holder
  restores the entries as queue cards; a fresh recreate does not), while with
  no live sharing holder the line is at rest and answers directly. An owed
  entry with no durable future is counted lost on every exit — including the
  no-write one.

Three properties the route holds, each of which fails silently if broken:

- The key comes from `effective_session_key(slot)`, never a derived
  `dashboard:<slot>`: a channel-born slot's turns run on the channel's session,
  and the derived form yields a key no session ever had — the clear finds nothing
  and the call still reports success.
- The teardown also ends the parent's sub-agent runs; see "Parent end ends the
  children" below for why that rides the release rather than being called here.
- `discard_conversation`, never `destroy`: the entry carries the Slack
  thread/channel linkage and the reverse index built from it.
- It is nonetheless a FULL teardown (provider shutdown plus
  `release_subagent_runtime`), so it takes the same guards the sibling `reload`
  route does, through the same shared helpers rather than a third policy:
  `_app_cancel_denied` on the resolved SESSION key, `provider.has_active_turn()`,
  `slot.running`, and `_subagents_attached_response`. Each protects work
  invisible from outside — a turn on the session with no dashboard task behind it
  (an inbound channel message, which `slot.running` cannot see), a turn
  mid-write, and children still running after their parent's turn ended.
  The four probes above are best-effort fast paths; the authoritative guard is
  the fifth, `discard_conversation(..., skip_if_busy=True)`, which probes the
  per-session SEMAPHORE atomically with the session pop and refuses with the
  same `turn_in_flight` 409. It closes the edge the fast paths share: a turn
  holding the semaphore before its prompt is in flight is invisible to
  `has_active_turn`. This is the same contract the sibling reload route rests
  on, so the two teardowns keep one notion of "busy". Of the route's refusal
  paths, only the atomic one emits a SEL `denied` record — it is the sole
  refusal that occurs after the route has committed to the teardown; the
  fast-path 409s are pre-checks and stay unlogged, as they are on the sibling.

Authorization is two layers. The per-slot checkpoint
(`slot_ownership_middleware`, [App Kit platform §13](app-kit-platform.md)) admits
an app only as the slot's owner on its own session and transcript, before the
handler runs. `_app_cancel_denied` then tests the resolved target key the caller
will actually act on. Ownership alone is not enough, and that is load-bearing:
`get_or_create_slot` resolves `linked_session_key` from the session map for a name
shaped like a channel stem, so an app that names a live channel thread ends up
OWNING a slot bound to a conversation it has no claim on, and slot ownership by
itself would let it wipe that channel conversation's resume pointer. The helper
runs BEFORE the 409s so a refusal cannot confirm the slot exists. Reaching the route needs
`/api/chat/slots` in the app's manifest `permissions.api`, and the capability it
grants is strictly smaller than the delete it already implies.

The transcript is deliberately left in place, so the tab still shows earlier
messages the model no longer remembers. That is the honest rendering — the record
is the user's, the context was the conversation's — and it is why this is an
explicit request rather than something the gateway does on its own.

### Parent end ends the children

`release_subagent_runtime` IS this module's parent-end boundary, so the runs a
parent owns are ended at every site that calls it. Both halves are driven here:
`_snapshot_parent_children` in the same lock hold as the pop, because every await
after that is a window a successor can register under the retired key in, and
`_cancel_parent_children` after the provider teardown, bounded and best-effort,
with the release as the backstop for whatever it does not reach. `subagent.md`
describes the two verbs and why the teardown one suppresses parent delivery.

Two properties of that call, each of which fails silently if broken:

- **It is outside any `if session` guard.** A live provider is not what makes a call a
  parent end. A reset pops the session and keeps the conversation, so the tab close that
  follows arrives with `session is None` while the children are still running — and that
  is the call that ends them. `remove` guarded both the cancel and the release on a live
  provider, which skipped exactly the sequence the reset/remove split makes ordinary.
- **The timeout bounds the parent's WAIT, not the reap.** `_cancel_parent_children` runs
  the verb as a task registered in `_background_tasks` and waits on
  `asyncio.shield(task)`, so `_CHILD_CANCEL_TIMEOUT_SECS` expiring leaves the reap
  running to completion. A bare `wait_for` cancels what it waits on, and this coroutine
  kills child processes: a long child reset would have its `_force_reap` cancelled after
  the marks were written and before the kills landed, leaving a write-capable child
  executing against a conversation that has ended.

Sites: `reset` (conditionally, see below), `remove`, `destroy`,
`discard_conversation`, `remove_if_unclaimed`, `retire_kiro_identity_sessions`.

The selection is NOT complete, and deliberately so. The mark and the snapshot are both
taken inside this lock hold, which is the only synchronous point available, so anything
already in flight sees neither: a spawn admitted late may still START, and a report already
past the delivery gate may still DELIVER into a conversation that has ended. Both are
bounded by the run's own timeout. Neither closes with another recheck at one end, because
any wider selection or later re-test needs an await, and an await cannot tell work
belonging to the retired conversation from work a successor under the same key has just
started — which needs a conversation-incarnation counter the session layer does not have.
Full argument in [subagent.md](subagent.md) § RESIDUAL; tracked in #12069.

The distinction is "does the CONVERSATION end", not "does the process die". `remove` is a
revivable ending — the entry survives for a future `session/load` — and it still takes the
children, because the conversation is over as far as the parent is concerned.

`reset` is on the other side by DEFAULT. It keeps the session-map entry and its resume sid,
so the next turn restores the same native conversation through `session/load`, which is why
it is the verb every evict-and-retry path reaches for: a wedged prompt (`AcpPromptBusy`), a
failed auto-compaction, a provider or model switch (`_reset_slot_session`, which serves the
agent / model / reasoning-effort / workspace switches and the reload endpoint), an idle
expiry, the channel watchdog, a task step's re-prompt. A child of a recycled session has a
conversation to deliver into and is bounded by its own run timeout, so stopping it would
discard live work for a conversation that is coming right back. The RSS recycle sits here
too and needs no argument: `_rss_threshold_check` declines outright for a session with
attached sub-agent work.

But some endings reach ONLY `reset`, so `ends_conversation=True` exists to say so, and
those callers are:

| caller | why it ends the conversation |
|---|---|
| `dashboard/handlers_channel.py` — `api_channel_clear_context` | the user asked the agent to forget the conversation (`scope=all` also wipes the channel's shared buffer) |
| `cron.py` — `cancel` / `_force_reap` | the job is cancelled or reaped, so its conversation is over |
| `taskrunner.py` — `_cleanup_run_sessions` | cancel cleanup ends every step conversation of the run |
| `workflows/agent_pool.py` — `reset` | the pool STARTS A NEW conversation on a pooled key |

The default is the recycle because that is what the overwhelming majority of `reset`'s ~46
callers are, and the two mistakes do not cost the same — but a MISSED flag costs more than an
orphan, which is the number a future caller has to weigh. It arms no delivery gate either, so
the child's report still reaches `_on_done`, which resolves the parent through
`get_or_create` and creates a session when none is live: the conversation the caller ended
re-opens, seeded with that report. The miss is the headline defect in full, not a bounded
process. A wrong `True` destroys live work for a conversation that resumes next turn, which is
why the default stays the recycle — but a new ending path that forgets the flag RESURRECTS,
and nothing structural catches it, because a keyword is invisible to the AST ratchet. Until
#12069's conversation-incarnation identity makes a forgotten flag harmless, the flag is the
whole guard and the path pin below is the only thing watching it.

Two exemptions from the release-site rule, each on a fact about itself:

- `close_all` — gateway shutdown runs `SubagentManager.cancel_all`, which also drains
  follow-up watchers and announces undelivered messages.
- `_retire_kiro_subagent_runtimes` — it reaps only IDLE companion runtimes, skipping any
  that answer `has_active_or_initializing_sessions()`, so it has no running child to end
  and the parent conversation continues.

A ratchet in `test_session.py` reads that off the source on the AST: a method that releases
a companion runtime without calling both halves fails it, the two exemptions are named
there, and an exempt method that stops releasing a runtime is reported so its exemption
never goes unchecked. The `ends_conversation=True` call sites are pinned separately, by
path, because a structural ratchet cannot see a keyword and losing one is silent.

### Load Recovery (stale native session lock — F2)

On restart / Make-Live cutover the previous gateway's kiro-cli is killed. If it
died uncleanly (SIGKILL, crash, OOM, or a drain timeout), its per-session lock
can stay held briefly, so the new gateway's `session/load` is rejected with an
**"active in another process"** error. The dashboard's hard-stop path has a
second shape of the same race: `stop_turn` resets the session and eagerly
respawns it, and kiro-cli's `session/load` in the new holder creates its lock
and re-reads it to confirm ownership — if the killed holder's exit handler
unlinks the same path in that window the load fails with **"failed to re-read
lock file ...: No such file or directory"**. Both are transient
(`_RESUME_TRANSIENT_LOCK_MARKERS`: `"active in another process"`, `"re-read lock
file"` — deliberately not a bare `"lock file"`, so a permanent failure such as
`Permission denied` on the lock path still fails fast to Phase 2)
and recovery happens at the resume
chokepoint (`AcpProvider._load_session_with_retry`, `providers/acp.py`) and
self-heals regardless of *why* the resume failed — it never depends on the dead
holder cooperating (unlike cooperative drain), so it covers every kill mode:

1. **Phase 1 — bounded retry (lossless).** Re-issue `session/load` up to
   `_RESUME_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (4) times with exponential backoff
   (`_RESUME_BACKOFF_BASE_S` → 1s, 2s, 4s). If the lock clears, the
   session resumes with full native history. A genuine (non-lock) load error is
   **not** retried, and a dead runtime aborts the loop immediately (the caller's
   respawn path takes over).
2. **Phase 2 — fresh session + history replay (backstop).** If the lock never
   clears, `_start_kiro_runtime_impl` falls through to a fresh `session/new` and
   sets `AcpProvider._history_replay_needed`. `get_or_create` reads that flag and
   sets `_Session.provider_switch_replay = True`, so `build_session_replay`
   injects KiroCrew's `conversation_log` into the new native session on the first
   prompt (the same replay path used for cross-provider switches). The slot
   resumes seamlessly instead of returning empty completions.

Observability: a successful Phase-1 recovery logs at INFO; exhausting all
attempts logs a single grep-able WARNING before migrating to Phase 2.

### Cross-Provider Continuity

kiro session IDs and the removed provider's session IDs are NOT interchangeable:
- kiro: arbitrary string, stored in `~/.kiro/sessions/cli/<sid>.{json,jsonl}`
- removed provider: UUID v4, stored in `~/.claude/projects/<encoded-cwd>/<sid>.jsonl`

When a user switches provider mid-session (e.g. config change from `acp` to
`claude_code`), conversation continuity is maintained via **history replay**,
never via session_id translation.

**Detection:** `detect_provider_switch(session_map, key, new_provider)` in
`session.py` compares the stored provider against the new one. Returns True
when a switch is detected (stored SID exists AND providers differ).

**Behavior on switch:**
1. `resume_sid` is discarded (not passed to the new provider process)
2. `SessionMap.clear_sid(key)` removes the stale SID from persistent state
3. `_Session.provider_switch_replay = True` flags the session for replay
4. The new provider's session_id (once obtained) is saved with the correct
   provider label
5. On the first prompt after the switch, `chat_runner` detects the flag and
   injects history from `build_session_replay()` (Kiro Crew's conversation_log)
6. The flag remains armed through prompt acceptance and is settled only when the
   replay-bearing turn lands. ACP providers promote a deliberately deferred fresh
   SID before consuming the lease; non-ACP providers already published their SID
   during allocation and consume the lease directly. Cancelled, failed, empty, or
   synthetic terminals leave it armed for the next prompt.

**Replayed content carries no image reference.** `_replay_rows` and
`_recall_rows` — the two row builders behind every history vehicle
(`build_session_replay` and the thread-history fallback in
`build_session_context`) — hand
each row out through
`kiro_crew.image_refs.strip_image_refs`, which replaces every local image
reference with `[image not carried into this context]`. Markdown references go
through the attachment store's own `iter_local_refs`; bare paths go through the
inliner's own `_PATH_RE`, narrowed to paths outside code spans that stand alone
rather than sit inside a URL query, because the inliner rewrites text only after
reading a file and an unconditional substitution would corrupt a URL or a code
snippet instead of scrubbing it. The grammar also admits a space or tab, since
an attachment name can carry one, and that is the shape the text cannot settle:
such a span has that token replaced when its last token is a path on its own,
and is replaced whole only when it is a channel's own attachment line — alone on
its line (list and quote markers allowed) AND ending in the `mkstemp` file name
every channel's shared ingest writer mints, which is what vouches for the space
before it (a temp directory under a profile like `John Smith`) — or a markdown
link's angle-form destination, which can hold nothing but a path. Being alone
on a line is not enough: `/var/log/app has the broken logo.png.` is a whole line
a person types. No delimiter pair vouches for one either, quotes included.
Otherwise the span keeps its text, so prose such as
`check /var/log/app and tell me why logo.png is broken` survives intact. Every
rule is lexical: the scrubber makes no filesystem call, because it runs inline
on the event loop while the inliner's own probes are offloaded through
`asyncio.to_thread`, and resolving a data home to settle a span would put a
network stat in front of every history row. The residue is every other spaced
path, a `Screen Shot 2024.png` a person typed alone on its line included: it
stays as text, which the inliner can still pick up on a replayed turn while the
file is there — the deliberate cost of not deleting the sentence around it.

A background one-liner (`llm_helpers.run_bg_oneliner`: titles, summaries,
suggestions, status cards, folder picks) never inlines at all. Its prompt is
text ABOUT a session, so a path in it is quoted history, and the turn goes out
with `allow_image=False` on whichever handle `get_bg_session()` returned; every
layer down to `build_prompt_blocks` forwards it (see
[acp-client](acp-client.md#image-support)). So no shape a caller composes (a
flattened row, a `  - User: ` prefix, a JSON string) can become an image block
for a text-only background model. The scrub it also runs only tidies the text.
The history consolidator's turns (the consolidation itself, the skill dedupe
judge and the skill merge) quote transcript rows the same way and go out the
same way, through `stream_and_collect(..., allow_image=False)`.
`chat_title._title_text` does not call the scrubber at all: it strips markdown
images and attachment markers its own way and keeps an escaped or code-quoted
`![x](…)` readable, while the scrubber's bare-path pass replaces the
destination inside an escaped one (a code-quoted one survives both passes). A
channel's bare path is neither, so it stays in the title prompt as text. A row's picture belonged
to an earlier turn and a text vehicle cannot carry bytes, so the reference is
the only thing that would arrive, and both readings of it are wrong: while the
file is still readable `build_prompt_blocks` re-inlines it (a picture an earlier
compaction already dropped returns at full byte cost on every later cold start),
and once the file is gone the path is left in the prose next to the assistant's
own earlier description of what it showed. Stripping at the row builders rather
than at each consumer is what makes the guarantee hold for all three. The
CURRENT turn is unaffected — it is excluded from the replay by identity, so a
freshly attached image still becomes a real image block.

**Same-provider resume:** unaffected. Normal `session/load` path with full
native fidelity.

**Audit:** A `provider_switch_detected` SEL event is emitted with both the
stored and new provider names for observability.

**Atomic write:** tmp file + `os.replace()` prevents corruption on crash.

**Deferred flush (event loop only):** a mutation made on the event loop marks
the map dirty and schedules a debounced flush task; the task serializes the map
under `_MAP_LOCK` into an immutable JSON payload, then performs the tmp+rename
in a worker thread — the loop never pays the file write inline, and `_data`
never crosses the thread boundary. Coalescing never drops a trailing mutation
(the task loops until it observes a clean map), and a per-snapshot ticket keeps
a slow in-flight write from landing an older map over a newer forced one.
`SessionMap.flush()` (sync contexts) and `SessionMap.aflush()` (awaited) are the
deterministic durability points. `SessionMap.aclose()` is the shutdown boundary
used by `SessionManager.close_all()`: it cancels and awaits the registered
debounce task, preserves an unstarted or claimed-but-unwritten snapshot, lands
it through `aflush()`, and returns only after the task registration is retired.
Off the loop (CLI, tests, worker threads) every mutation still writes inline. Losing a pending
flush on a crash leaves a well-formed older map, never a truncated file.

**Auto-prune:** `SessionMap.get()` auto-removes entries whose `.json` file
no longer exists, or whose `.jsonl` holds no turn (the entry drops from memory
immediately; the file write rides the deferred flush). `SessionMap.prune()`
bulk-removes all stale entries at startup. The resumability rule itself —
kiro-cli's `.json` present and `.jsonl` at least `_RESUMABLE_JSONL_MIN_BYTES`,
any other backend left to `session/load` — has ONE definition:
`_RESUMABLE_JSONL_MIN_BYTES` read through `_jsonl_holds_a_turn`, which `get()`
prunes on directly and `session_files_resumable(sid, provider)` wraps together with
the `.json` and provider checks for a reader outside the module (the sub-agent
orphan notice's resume hint), so the two cannot drift. Both stale paths (`get()`
and `prune()`) ask `_keeps_entry`: an entry carrying a durable setting,
a generation floor, a channel binding (`_survives_prune`), or a `temporary` /
`incognito` privacy flag loses only its dead `sid` and keeps the rest -- with no
transcript read, because both run under the map lock on the event loop. A
privacy-flagged row is removed by NO path, whatever its transcript header says:
the flag is the record the channel's inbound gate hydrates from
(`privacy_mode.hydrate` restores the trackers from the map alone, never from the
header), so a row removed for any reason leaves that gate reading the thread as
persistent after the next restart -- its turns persisted, agent memory writes
admitted. The header is still ensured: `start_pool` runs
`SessionMap.stamp_privacy_headers()` right after `prune()` -- awaited in place on
the blocking path, inside the task the non-blocking path already schedules on
the other (the live-config appliers and the dashboard's background-session
restart return without waiting on the sweep, whose cost scales with the
retained rows) -- which lists every
flagged row under the lock with no filesystem call (`privacy_flagged_entries`
-- channel-bound or not, live `sid`, cleared `sid` or none, because the header
is the record for the thread, not for the provider session) and, on a worker
thread with no lock held, probes each row's transcript header and copies the
mode into it where it is missing or weaker (`_header_records_privacy_mode`,
tighten-only, `require_existing`: never creating a transcript). It returns a
count and removes nothing. A flag TIGHTENED while the probe ran off the loop
leaves the header stamped with the mode the worker saw -- never looser than
before -- and the next pass reads the current flags and re-stamps the tightened
mode. The retained rows are bounded at `PRIVACY_ROW_CAP` (the trackers' own
`PRIVACY_LRU_MAX`, 10,000) and the bound is held by refusing, never by evicting:
a NEW privacy flag past it is refused fail-closed by `SessionMap.set_flag`
(`PrivacyRowRefused`; the modifier then tells the user the message was not
processed and does not run it), a key over `PRIVACY_ROW_KEY_MAX` (200) is
refused at the same gate, tightening a row already retained is never refused,
and no retained row is ever evicted -- it is the record the channel gate
hydrates from. Retiring rows once the header carries the mode needs the channel
gate to read the header, a separate change. Immortality of durable
settings stays opt-in (`_DURABLE_FLAGS`).

**Mapped-session enumeration:** `SessionMap.mapped_sids_by_key()` returns session
key → kiro-cli session ID for every entry that has one. Disk accounting
([session-storage](session-storage.md)) needs both halves of that relation: the IDs
to exclude from reclaiming (a mapped session is resumable), and the key each ID
belongs to so a session's transcript can be paired with its replay log. Returning
the mapping rather than only the ID set is what lets a caller reclaim a session
whole instead of leaving one half behind.

**Dashboard history key round-trip:** Session keys use `:` (e.g.
`dashboard:chat-1-xxx`) but JSONL filenames use `_safe_key()` which replaces
`:` with `_`. When a session is resumed from history, the slot name comes from
the filename stem (`dashboard_chat-1-xxx`), producing session key
`dashboard:dashboard_chat-1-xxx`. `SessionMap.get()` handles this by falling
back to the canonical form (`dashboard:chat-1-xxx`) when the direct lookup
fails.

**Slot-key filename normalization:** `get_or_create_slot()` folds every
caller-provided slot name to the `_safe_key()` filename charset
(`[A-Za-z0-9_\-.]`, via `_normalize_slot_key()` — `dashboard:`/`dashboard_`
transport-prefix strip mirroring `_history_key_for()`, then ASCII fold, then
filename fold), so a slot key always equals its persisted filename stem. Without this,
display-style slot names (e.g. `Artifact: My Doc` from the artifact iterate
flow) diverged from their sanitized filename: after a gateway restart,
`restore_open_slots()` rehydrated the raw key from `open_slots.json` while
`restore_recent_sessions()` derived a second slot from the filename stem,
producing duplicate sidebar sessions backed by one transcript.
`restore_open_slots()` and `_rehydrate_slot_from_history()` apply the same
fold on read so pre-fix snapshots carrying both key forms self-heal (the
second form hits the dedup guard); the open-tab read screens and folds each key
through `_sanitize_open_slot_key` (`dashboard/slot_persistence/restore_inputs.py`). When normalization changes the name, the
original pretty form is preserved as the slot's initial title
(redaction-scrubbed, non-pinned so auto-title can still override).

**Permanent history deletion keeps ownership exact.**
`DELETE /api/sessions/{key}` unlinks the selected transcript first. History
aliases may locate a slot candidate, but they do not prove ownership. Before the
unlink awaits, the route captures the slot object, its transcript key, its
SessionManager key, and the key's monotonic ownership generation. Legacy Slack
aliases can name either a canonical or pre-migration bare file, so the off-loop
delete worker resolves the selected history key and captured slot transcript to
the filename each one actually uses while holding that transcript's cross-process
lock set. Slack deletion, restore, and ordinary transcript writers all use
`ConversationLog.locked_stems` to take canonical `slack_<ts>` and legacy `<ts>`
locks in sorted order; writers resolve their physical target only after that set
is held, so none can publish through an alias the others did not serialize. A
path mismatch rejects the candidate.

Deferred cleanup compares object identity, task identity, current transcript and
SessionManager routing, and the current manager generation with the immutable
claim in the same yield-free span as the pop. Cron, workflow, and channel
adoption can relink an existing slot object; a rerouted object is preserved even
though its identity is unchanged. A new turn on the same route changes its task
or generation and is preserved too. A captured absence never claims a later
successor.

Every `get_or_create` reserves its logical key under the registry lock before
resume lookup or provider startup. Reservation publication/removal and every
session registration/removal — including provider-reload and shutdown mass
clears — advance the generation shared by canonical and legacy Slack aliases.
Successful claims remove their token synchronously before returning, in the
same yield-free span that owns the acquired lease. Failure and cancellation
drain token removal under the registry lock. `destroy_if` requires the captured
generation to remain current, requires no reservation and an idle session, then
evaluates current live-slot ownership under the same manager lock as the
provider pop. The session-map entry is deleted before the awaited end metric.
History deletion uses the explicit override-preserving mode; ordinary destroy
continues to clear the old conversation's threshold.

Chat pins, work ledgers, and per-session autocompact overrides are preserved.
They are independent stores that can be claimed by a transcript created or
restored in another process after any owner scan or in-process epoch check.
Making their deletion atomic would require every cross-process transcript writer
and restore path to share one mutation protocol with in-memory dashboard state.
The request path chooses the smaller fail-safe rule instead: stale sidecars are
reversible, while deleting a successor's state is not.

## Slack Thread Linking

Sessions can be linked to Slack threads via `SessionMap` fields
`slack_thread_ts` and `slack_channel_id`. This enables bidirectional sync
between dashboard chat and Slack. Slack is the legacy special case: other
channels link through the generic ChannelLink mirror map (see
[messaging.md](messaging.md)). The `slack_*` fields are retained for backward
compatibility.

**API:**
- `SessionManager.set_slack_link(key, thread_ts, channel_id)` — persists to session map
- `SessionManager.get_slack_link(key) -> (thread_ts | None, channel_id | None)`
- `SessionManager.get_session_for_thread(thread_ts) -> key | None` — reverse lookup,
  keyed by the **bare** Slack `thread_ts`; returns the linked session key
  (canonical `slack:<ts>` for self-linked Slack threads, `dashboard:chat-N`
  for dashboard-linked threads)
- `SessionManager.set_channel(key, channel_id)` — backward-compat alias

**Slack handler:** calls `set_slack_link(session_key, reply_ts, channel)`
(where `reply_ts` is the bare Slack thread_ts and `session_key` is the
canonical `slack:<ts>` form) outside the `if is_new` guard so every message
refreshes the link.

## Slack Session-Key Alias Fold

Slack thread sessions have two historical key forms: the legacy bare
`thread_ts` (`"1783733803.877979"`) and the canonical namespaced form
(`"slack:1783733803.877979"`, `messaging/link.py`). The Slack handler derives
the canonical form at message entry (`canonical_key(thread_ts or msg_ts)`),
but legacy callers and persisted state may still present bare keys.

`SessionManager._fold_key(key)` resolves the two alias forms onto whichever
form is live in the in-memory registry (exact match → canonical alias →
legacy bare alias; unknown keys pass through unchanged, so non-Slack
namespaces are never rewritten). Every public key-taking method
(`get_or_create`, `has_session`, `get_provider`, `get_pid`, `release`,
`stop_turn`, `enqueue`/`dequeue`/queue helpers, `reset`, `remove`, `destroy`,
approval-policy accessors, `record_success`/`record_failure`,
`check_context_usage`, `cancel_current`, `is_provider_alive`) folds at entry.

Without the fold, the thread-index lookup (which returns canonical keys) and
a live session registered under the bare key disagree, so the second
in-thread message misses the live session, the disk resume is rejected by
kiro-cli ("Session is active in another process"), and a brand-new
context-free session silently splits the thread.

`ConversationLog._path()` applies the same back-compat: a canonical key whose
file doesn't exist yet falls back to the legacy bare-`thread_ts` filename
when that exists, so a thread active across the migration keeps one log file.

**Dashboard chat:** mirrors user messages to linked Slack threads via
`slack_client.post_message()`. The "Send to Slack" button (`slack/blocks.py`)
opens a DM thread, links the session, and posts the last 5 messages as context.

**Dashboard state:** `ChatSlot.summary()` includes `slack_linked: bool` so
the frontend can show a link indicator. `_ChatSlot.task` publishes ownership through a
property that increments `_turn_generation` for every new non-null task. The counter is
process-local and monotonic for the slot lifetime; unlike `task`, normal turn teardown
does not clear it, so code spanning an await can detect a turn that started and finished
inside that interval.

**Slash commands** (`slack/events.py`):
- `/kirocrew sessions` — lists active sessions with Slack link status
- `/kirocrew sessions resume <key>` — resumes a session in the current thread

**Block Kit builders** (`slack/blocks.py`): reusable Block Kit dict builders
for slash command UIs. Action IDs follow `mc_<command>_<action>[_<id>]`.

## DM Channel Session Keys & Mid-Turn Handling

DM channels (Telegram, WeCom) have no thread concept, so `messaging/link.py`
derives the session key with `build_dm_session_key(channel, agent, user, *,
gen, dm_scope)`:

- **Shape** (channel-first): `{channel}:{agent}:{chatType}:{user}` plus an
  optional `:gen{N}` suffix. The part before the suffix is a durable **bucket**
  (history and channel links hang off it); the **generation** rotates to start a
  fresh transcript within the bucket. `chatType` is `direct` today; `group` is
  reserved.
- **`dm_scope`** (`MessagingConfig.dm_scope`): `per-channel-peer` (default) —
  one bucket per `(channel, user)`; `unified` — all DMs collapse into a single
  `unified:{agent}` bucket for cross-surface continuity. `agent` is part of the
  bucket by design, so switching the configured agent starts a fresh session
  rather than replaying another agent's context.
- **Generation reset** rotates on `/new`, an idle window
  (`MessagingConfig.idle_reset_minutes`), or a daily boundary
  (`daily_reset_hour`), decided by `should_rotate_generation()`.
- **Explicit `/new` is durable on every DM channel.** Discord, Telegram, Teams,
  Webex, Feishu, iMessage, WhatsApp, Weixin and WeCom persist the new generation as
  a monotonic floor on the stable `SessionMap` bucket and await its flush before
  replying. A failed floor write leaves the in-memory bump intact but adds a
  restart-safety warning. A zero-turn generation creates no conversation-log row:
  it holds no work to recover, and repeated `/new` calls therefore update one floor
  integer instead of crowding the newest-first picker with empty placeholders. The
  first normal turn creates the real history row. Automatic idle/daily rotation still
  materializes only when its first real turn runs.
- **Restart-safe generation seeding.** The generation counter is in-memory (per
  `ConversationState`), so it resets on gateway restart. To stop `/new` from
  bumping a reset counter (0→1) straight onto a still-persisted generation and
  resurrecting that old conversation, the counter is seeded on first access to a
  bucket from the highest mapped generation or explicit-new floor via
  `SessionMap.max_generation(bucket)` (shared helper
  `messaging.link.seed_generation`, used by every DM dispatcher). A normal
  post-restart message then resumes the latest generation (continuity); `/new`
  always advances past every persisted generation, minting a genuinely fresh sid.

Legacy bare-thread Slack keys are unaffected — they keep the
`canonical_key`/`legacy_key` shim. The DM channels are recent, so the key shape
carries no prior persisted history to migrate.

Slack does not use this key shape even for its own DMs. `slack.dm_single_session`
gives a 1:1 DM one session by keying it `slack:<channel_id>`
(`slack.transport_dispatch.flat_dm_session_key`) rather than by minting a
four-segment bucket: a two-segment Slack key is what the existing thread keys
already are, so the fold shim, the thread index and every caller that
reverse-derives from a Slack key keep working unchanged. It carries no
generation suffix, so the idle/daily rotation above does not apply — a flat DM
relies on ordinary context compaction instead.

### Mid-turn messages (steer / queue)

`SessionManager.is_busy(key)` reports whether a turn holds the session
semaphore. When a DM arrives mid-turn, the dispatcher acts on
`MessagingConfig.queue_mode`:

- `steer` (default): fold the message into the running turn via the provider's
  steer channel.
- `queue`: enqueue it — checked atomically against the semaphore, so a turn
  that finishes in the window runs the message instead of stranding it — and
  drain it after the turn, iteratively and capped (not recursively).

A DM bound to a **resumed dashboard session** is the exception: `is_busy` there
usually means the DASHBOARD turn loop holds the semaphore, and the channel's queue
is drained only at the tail of a channel-driven turn with resume routing off, so a
message enqueued there would later run in the channel's native session. Discord
hands such a message to the dashboard slot's own machinery instead
(`dashboard/channel_handoff.py`): the slot's steer path (`steer_into_running_turn`,
recording the same audience fence a peer steer records) or the slot's queue
(`queue_for_next_turn`, drained by the dashboard turn loop), and confirms in the
DM. The refusal stays when the slot cannot take the message — no open slot, a
closing or remote-bound slot, a slot that is not itself running the turn (a
channel-driven turn on the resumed key), or attachments; an incognito or
temporary session is taken like any other, since those modes keep their
transcript and queue. See [messaging](messaging.md#a-busy-resumed-dashboard-session-takes-the-slots-own-machinery-discord).

WeCom always steers regardless of `queue_mode`: its replies are bound to the
inbound request, so a queued-then-drained reply can't be delivered later
(capability-driven, like `supports_proactive_send=False`).

### Queued prompt durability

A prompt admitted while the slot is busy is answered `{"ok": true, "queued":
true}` and held in `slot._queue`. Its transcript row is written by the DRAIN,
not by the enqueue, so the queue is the only record until it runs — and a
gateway restart in that window (an auto-update, a watchdog exit) used to drop
the prompt with no row, no error card, and an empty queue on reload.

The slot save therefore persists it. `slot.durable_queue_entries()`
(`slot_queue_repository.durable_queue_entries`) selects the entries and the
metadata line carries them as `queued_prompts`, a `SLOT_OWNED_META_KEYS` field
so absence clears it.

- **The accept STARTS the write, it does not wait for the interval.**
  `queue_for_next_turn` hands `flush_slot_now` to the executor
  (`start_queue_persist`) so the residual loss window is one save's duration
  rather than one flush interval. BOTH accept sites use it: the busy-slot path
  and `chat_handlers`' sub-agent hold branch, which holds an IDLE slot where no
  drain is coming and the wait for the last sub-agent is unbounded. Each accepts
  onto the same queue under the same ceilings, so each starts the write.
  Started, not awaited: the acknowledgment keeps
  its existing meaning — accepted in memory, durable on a flush — because making
  durability a precondition would refuse a queued send on a slow or failing disk,
  taking the user's words away at the one moment they cannot be re-read from the
  transcript. A failed background write is logged and stays owed to the periodic
  flush; with no running loop (a synchronous caller) the flush owns it as before.
  **One writer per slot.** Two immediate writers would snapshot independently and
  the transcript's file lock orders their commits, not their reads, so the older
  snapshot could land last and put back a value missing an acknowledged prompt.
  A send arriving mid-write records the debt (`_queue_persist_owed`) and the
  finishing writer runs one follow-up pass when the queue still differs from disk.
  That flag gates only the writers it starts, so the save closes the rest: inside
  the history lock it compares the slot's committed-queue witness
  (`_queue_persisted_sig`) against the value held when it read the queue, and
  refuses the pass when another writer committed in between. Only a committed
  value refuses — a queue that merely moved is an ordinary consistent past state —
  and a refused pass leaves the queue owed rather than dropped, so losing the race
  costs one flush interval of lag instead of an acknowledged prompt. A rows-only
  write over another holder's line is exempt, since it defers the key instead of
  deciding it. Both refusals this adds mark the slot dirty on the way out, because
  `flush_slot_now` clears `_dirty` on any return that did not raise and compares
  `_dirty_gen` to spot a concurrent mark: without it a refused pass would drop
  window rows it never wrote, and the queue signal cannot cover them once the
  overtaking writer has satisfied it.

- **Run now dispatches an idle queued card; it does not cancel child work.**
  `POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/interrupt` keeps its stop-and-preserve behavior
  while the parent turn is running. When the parent is idle, the endpoint
  **requires** an explicit `queue_id` naming the selected card: it revalidates
  that exact card and starts it directly. A missing, empty, or non-string
  `queue_id` on the idle path is rejected with `400 invalid_queue_id` — the
  bypass exists only to run a card the user chose, so it never falls back to the
  queue front or dispatches unselected work. The running path leaves
  `queue_id` optional: a running-parent interrupt is a stop-and-preserve, and
  the `queue_id` there only promotes the matching card to the front, so a value
  that matches no card is a no-op rather than a refusal.
  This explicit action bypasses only the background-subagent user-message hold;
  an active stage, a stop in progress, or a remote-bound slot still refuses it.
  Attached subagents keep running, and their later completion injections use the
  ordinary busy-slot queue. If admission revalidation removed the selected card,
  the endpoint returns `409 queue_item_unavailable` so the client releases its
  pending-action latch instead of treating a no-op as accepted. Interrupt requests
  that produce a command outcome are audited to the SEL as a
  `dashboard_interrupt` command: the idle dispatch logs `outcome="started"`, a
  running press logs the `stop_turn` outcome (`soft` / `hard` / `idle` / `compacting`), and a
  superseded or already-in-progress press logs `outcome="noop"`. Requests
  rejected before a command outcome, including validation and idle-dispatch
  race refusals, are recorded by the generic mutating-API audit instead.

- **Only a plain user prompt is durable.** An entry carrying a `kind` is an
  injection whose producer is gone (a cron notification names an event, and a
  restart is not that event happening again); an entry carrying a `payload` is a
  synthetic recovery continuation; an entry carrying `_on_consumed` /
  `_on_irreversibly_consumed` acknowledges an automatic payload through a
  callback that does not survive the process. `meta` rides along verbatim,
  because it holds the admission-time containment snapshot the drain
  re-validates against and an entry without one fails closed.
- **Provenance does NOT survive the restart, and that is a security property.**
  `_directive_user_origin` / `_directive_channel_origin` record that an entry's
  words came from an authenticated human, and the drain reduces the consumed
  entries' flags into `producer_is_user_facing`, which admits user-surface and
  self-arming directives and exempts them from the LINKED containment
  constraint. The metadata line is an ordinary readable-writable file in the
  crew home, not a write-protected one, so a flag read back from it is
  indistinguishable from one a prompt-injected agent's shell wrote — authority
  granted to whoever can write the file. Neither half of the round trip moves
  it: the keys are absent from `_DURABLE_QUEUE_KEYS` so the writer never emits
  them, and `sanitize_restored_queue` drops a hand-added one, so a restored
  entry is non-directive by construction.
- **Correctness rests on the window and the queue being ONE observation.** The
  drain removes the entry and appends its row in the same event-loop step, and
  the save runs in the flush executor thread, so the save takes the pair under
  one consistency generation: read the queue, snapshot the window, read the
  queue again, retry while the two disagree, and REFUSE the save (nothing
  written, the entry still owed) when no pair is proven inside the budget. Read
  separately, the two halves could commit a file showing neither the entry nor
  its row. A crash between the drain and the save loses the row as well, so a
  replayed entry is a prompt the transcript never recorded — never a second copy
  of one it did. The pairing and the in-lock committed-witness refusal are the
  save's guards in `dashboard/slot_persistence/write_guards.py`
  (`paired_window_snapshot`, `_queue_snapshot_is_stale`); the value rides the line
  that `metadata_line.build_full_line` folds.
- **Restored entries are handed back as queue CARDS, not dispatched.** Nothing
  drains an idle slot on boot, so the user sends, edits or deletes them. This is
  the same rule `sendTurn.ts` follows for an indeterminate send: a prompt whose
  turn may have run un-persisted must never be auto-resent.
- **Durability does not depend on the mutation site.** `_queue_persisted_sig`
  records what the last committed save wrote and `slot.queue_persist_pending`
  compares it against the live queue, so an in-place rewrite — a reorder, a
  force-stop clear — is picked up by the periodic flush
  without each site marking the slot dirty. The flush and the resumed-slot no-op
  guard both read it beside `_dirty`.
- **A rows-only handover save defers the key** (it is in
  `ROWS_ONLY_DEFERRED_META_KEYS`): the line describes the live holder, whose
  queue this write does not own. The popped slot keeps owing its own entries,
  which is the conservative side. `_persist_handover_tail` therefore treats an
  owed queue as work — a queued prompt changes neither the window length nor
  `_dirty`, so its "nothing owed" test would otherwise answer True over one — and
  judges each owed entry's durable future by who writes the line next: an entry
  with none is reported in every register that can still hold it — the
  warning log, the `prompts_lost` field of its returned result, and a dashboard
  notification that names the slot and the count (never the prompt text).
  Nothing in the
  process visits that slot again, the same position the held `/note` lines are in.
- Bounds: `MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_ENTRIES` entries and `MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_BYTES` of
  serialized value, admitted front-first because the front runs first. An
  over-budget prompt is DROPPED, never truncated — a shortened prompt replayed
  as the user's own words is worse than one reported as not carried. The SAME
  two ceilings gate the restore, costed against the SAME key projection, because
  the writer's bounds bound only what this gateway wrote and the line can be
  edited outside it, while whatever the restore admits is retained live and
  re-serialized by every later save. The projection matters: the restore adds
  `kind: ""` to keep a restored entry out of the system-injection paths, and
  billing itself for that key would make the reader's budget the smaller of the
  two, so a queue written just under the ceiling would drop its tail on the way
  back in — losing a prompt that WAS durably written.
  `MAX_DURABLE_QUEUE_SCAN` bounds how much of the raw value is INSPECTED, which
  the retention cap does not: the apply phase reading it is loop-affine, so a
  hand-edited line must not buy startup work proportional to its own length.
  Entries past it are counted as not restored, never quietly ignored.
- The send is **not refused** when the bounds cannot carry it: taking the user's
  words away at the one moment they cannot be re-read from the transcript is
  worse than a best-effort durable copy. `durable_queue_view` returns the
  persisted entries and the candidate count from ONE read of the queue, and the
  save logs their difference once, naming the slot, so the omission is an
  operational fact rather than a silent one. The pairing matters: counted from
  two reads, an ordinary send landing during a save is reported as a prompt the
  bounds refused. The ACCEPT reports it too, and earlier:
  `warn_if_not_durable` logs at WARNING when the entry just queued is one the
  write will not keep, naming the slot, the entry, the candidate count, the
  carried count and which ceiling refused it. Both the verdict and the reason are
  read off `durable_queue_entries`' own output — an entry absent from a full set
  was refused by the count cap, absent from a short one by the byte budget — so
  nothing re-implements the interacting ceilings. This is a LOG, not a receipt
  field: a caller-visible `durable` boolean on the acknowledgments has no reader,
  so it is not shipped, and the on-screen queue-card marker belongs with its
  consumer (issue #11695).

## Cross-Surface Reply Mirror

The same conversation can appear on a channel and in the
dashboard. Two models relate the surfaces:

- **Slack — one session, two surfaces (fold-in).** A linked Slack thread folds
  into the dashboard session: the handler swaps the session key to the linked
  dashboard session via `get_session_for_thread`, so there is a single backing
  sid and Slack is a projection of it (see *Slack Thread Linking*).
- **Discord / Telegram / Webex / Teams / WeCom / Weixin — two sessions, bridged by a mirror.** The channel message
  runs under its own channel session (`{channel}:…:genN` → its own sid); the
  dashboard surfaces it as a separate slot with its own sid. One logical
  conversation therefore has two backing sids, bridged by the mirror.

`messaging.link.legacy_dashboard_mirror_key(channel_session_key)` computes the
dashboard-side key: `"dashboard:" + history._safe_key(channel_session_key)`. It
MUST use the same `_safe_key` sanitizer as the slot-naming path (every non-word
char → `_`, not only `:`); a narrower sanitizer silently mismatches for keys
containing spaces/unicode, so the mirror never fires despite `/link` succeeding.

**Directions.** Inbound (channel → dashboard display) is independent of the
mirror link and always on — the channel turn writes the shared `conv_log`, which
the dashboard rehydrates as a slot. Outbound (dashboard → channel echo) fires
only when a `mirror` `ChannelLink` exists on the dashboard-side key:

```
   Messaging channel                            Dashboard tab
  ┌────────────────────┐   inbound: ALWAYS ON   ┌────────────────────┐
  │ channel session    │ ═════════════════════▶ │ dashboard slot     │
  │ …:genN  (sid A)    │                        │ dashboard:…_genN   │
  │                    │ ◀── outbound: only ──  │ (sid B)            │
  └────────────────────┘      when /link is ON   └────────────────────┘
```

**API:**
- `SessionManager.set_mirror_link(key, link)` / `clear_mirror_link(key)` /
  `get_mirror_link(key)` — persist/read the outbound `ChannelLink` (Slack routes
  to `set_slack_link` so its reverse index stays intact). The read synthesizes a
  Slack mirror from the legacy `slack_thread_ts` / `slack_channel_id` fields only
  when a thread is named: a threadless Slack row — the bucket `set_channel` stamps
  on a channel session's first turn, which `clear_mirror_link` leaves behind — is
  bookkeeping nobody can deliver through and reads as `None`, so no reader needs
  its own copy of that rule. `clear_mirror_link` takes BOTH spellings a channel
  session's binding can live on in one save — the canonical row and the
  pre-unification `dashboard:` row it superseded — because the read falls back
  to the older row the moment the canonical one is gone: popping the winner
  alone left the session reading as mirrored to its previous target, and the
  dashboard redrew the row its Unlink had just reported removed. The link may
  also carry the **peer it was admitted for** (`ChannelLink.principal`), stored
  inside the `mirror` row and read back with it: the dashboard's mirror-link
  handler records the `user:<id>` it resolved and admitted, a Discord `!sessions`
  pick records the pressing owner, and every other writer (an origin bind, a room
  or thread target) records none. Because `session_map.json` is writable by
  in-sandbox code, such a row carries an `admission` — HMAC-SHA256 over the
  canonical session key and the whole location under a key derived from the
  sandbox-masked `token_signing.key` (`kiro_crew.mirror_admission`) — minted ONLY
  by those two creation paths before they hand the link over. `set_mirror_link`
  never mints or repairs one: it stores the caller's bytes verbatim, so a rollback
  that re-sets a row it read back keeps a verifying admission byte-for-byte and can
  never sign a planted one
  (every rollback first passes the row through `mirror_admission.restorable_link`,
  which strips a peer whose admission does not verify), and a row assembled
  anywhere else never verifies. Neither field is part of the binding's identity —
  the nonce rule, `find_mirror_sessions` and the location sweep compare links by
  location alone; a rollback's ownership guard alone compares the whole row
  (`ChannelLink.same_row`) — and both are replaced with the row, so a rewrite that
  names no peer stores none. Their reader is the per-send recipient
  check in [messaging](messaging.md) (§ Proactive sends), for a dashboard-born
  session whose key names nobody: it hands the roster the peer only when the
  admission verifies
  for that session and location, and a rotated signing key refuses every such
  mirror until it is re-linked.
- `SessionManager.clear_mirror_link_if(key, channel_type, token)` /
  `clear_slack_link_if(key, channel_type, token)` — compare-and-clear as ONE
  step under the map's own lock: the binding held is recomputed into its row
  token (`messaging.link.binding_token`, with the binding's persisted nonce)
  and cleared only if channel and token both match; False is a mismatch — the
  binding changed, or there is none — and nothing is touched. The only way an
  unlink that NAMES a binding clears it. A route that reads the binding,
  compares it and then clears it performs two steps, and a rebind landing
  between them (another thread's `!sessions` pick, a rival claim, the
  dispatcher re-asserting an origin mirror) is cleared by a stale unlink that
  matched the binding before it — so the routes hold no compare of their own
  (`test_channel_connect_row.py::TestCompareAndClearIsOneStep` enumerates
  the unlink routes and asserts it). The mirror twin clears exactly as
  `clear_mirror_link` does (both spellings, one save, the unbind audit); the
  Slack twin clears both key spellings of a dashboard session.
- `SessionManager.clear_mirror_links_at(link)` — value-keyed sweep: clears
  EVERY session whose mirror targets that exact non-Slack location and returns
  the cleared keys. The write counterpart of `find_mirror_sessions`, and the
  only clear that reaches a binding stranded under a key spelling the
  conversation no longer derives (a rotated DM generation, or a pre-unification
  `dashboard:` row of a DIFFERENT session — the same session's own legacy row is
  within `clear_mirror_link`'s reach).
- `POST /api/chat/slots/{name}/mirror-link` | `mirror-unlink` — dashboard-side
  endpoints (auth posture matches `slack-link`: under the `/api/chat`
  `mixed_internal_paths` prefix, never the strict `internal_paths` set).
  New links use `{channel_type, target_id}` and resolve the opaque configured
  target server-side; the legacy `{conversation_id, thread_id?}` body remains
  accepted for compatibility. A successful new link posts an anchor plus the
  last five redacted messages before persisting the mirror. `mirror-unlink` is
  what the session menu's **Unlink from X** item calls for EVERY row — a body
  naming a `slack` binding is the slot's Slack thread, and the handler hands it
  to `slack-unlink`'s (which owns that teardown: both key spellings, the slot's
  own fields, the thread's reverse index, the courtesy note). Which store a
  binding lives in is the server's fact, kept beside the code that enforces it
  (`mirror-link` refuses Slack on channel type, so no slack-typed mirror is
  creatable, and `SessionMap.get_mirror_link` already reads the thread as the
  session's mirror); the menu carries no channel-to-endpoint switch of its own
  — the same client-side inference, made for the `driven` flag, renders a
  paused Slack row as a one-way link. It is
  the one user-facing action that SEVERS an explicit binding, as
  distinct from the Disconnect row, which pauses it. #3006 removed the sever
  actions (the chip's Release button, the menu's Stop-mirroring items) when it
  made Disconnect mean "output stops, the binding stays"; the Unlink item
  reinstates one, on the evidence of #14068, because a paused binding is still a
  binding: it still routes that conversation's messages into
  the session and still counts as a mirror for session control, so a session
  disconnected from the menu stays refused ("sessions mirrored to a channel
  cannot control other sessions") with no exit short of an in-channel `/unlink`.
  The item is offered on every channel the session is explicitly bound
  to and never on a channel the session was BORN in: a channel-born session
  carries two rows for its own conversation — the `origin` row and the
  self-mirror `bind_origin_mirror` writes on every inbound turn — and popping that
  mirror would leave dashboard-taken turns and the auto-compact notice reaching
  nobody until the next inbound message rebound it, so the menu judges the group
  by its `origin` row and offers Disconnect alone there. On success the dashboard
  drops that channel's explicit link rows at once (`dropSlotLinks`) and the
  endpoint's own `push_slots_update` confirms it. **The request names the binding
  it severs.** Both `mirror-unlink` and `slack-unlink` accept an optional body
  `{channel_type, binding}` spelled as the slots projection spells the row: the
  channel and the row's opaque `binding` token, a digest of the WHOLE binding —
  channel type, full conversation id, thread id and the binding's own persisted
  nonce — minted by the projection
  (`messaging.link.binding_token`) and recomputed by the map from the binding
  it holds inside `clear_mirror_link_if` / `clear_slack_link_if`, which clear
  only on equality; the body reader `_expected_binding` in `dashboard/state.py`
  is the routes' one piece of the guard, and the routes hold no compare of
  their own. The token, not the redacted
  `target`, is the identity, because the display tail drops the thread and the
  id's head: a Slack thread and its same-channel replacement (a re-link after an
  unlink, or a Slack-side resume, both land in the same owner DM on a fresh
  thread) read alike on `target` and differ on `binding`. The nonce is what
  separates a binding from its byte-identical recreation: `SessionMap` mints one
  (`mirror_nonce` beside `mirror`, `slack_link_nonce` beside the Slack fields)
  whenever a binding is created or its target changes, keeps it across an
  identical rewrite (the inbound paths re-write the same coordinates on every
  turn), and drops it with the binding — so unlink → reconnect the SAME target
  yields a new token, and a delayed unlink from a tab still holding the old row
  is refused instead of deleting the binding another tab just made. A binding
  written before nonces existed has none and its token digests the coordinates
  alone; the binding that replaces it carries a nonce, which is all the guard
  needs. The menu always sends
  it, because the row it renders can be stale — a tab that missed a slots push
  while its socket reconnected still shows the old row after another tab
  rebound the slot — and a key-only clear would delete the binding the clicker
  never saw. A mismatch, or no binding at all, is 409 `mirror_changed` and
  clears nothing; the menu reports it under the row as **"The X connection
  changed while this menu was open. Nothing was unlinked; the row was
  refreshed."** — worded after what the refusal knows (the connection the row
  was drawn from was replaced, nothing was cleared) and never as "no longer
  linked", because a nonce-only mismatch (a Slack thread replaced in the same
  channel, a rebind after an unlink from a second tab) means the channel IS
  linked, to a new target, and the refetch redraws the row as connected beside
  the notice — and refetches the slots. While that notice shows the channel's
  Unlink item is not rendered at all and the toggle row's consequence line and
  direction tag are withheld — the refetch may redraw the very same row (a
  binding re-linked on the same channel), and an Unlink (live or dimmed — a
  dimmed one still read as "odd"), or a line or tag saying the connection
  stands, directly under "nothing was unlinked" contradicted it; they follow
  the notice and return with its dismissal (or the row's next click). The
  agent hand-off item stays, for the stale refusal as for every other failure:
  inside Radix menu content it is the notice's only keyboard-reachable
  escalation and renders in the notice's own branch, `aria-describedby` the
  notice's id (`errors-use-error-notice`'s third sanctioned state — a notice
  with neither `askAgent` nor that sibling is a dead end), and a notice that
  says the connection changed is a question the agent can answer — which the
  item now says under its label, in the menu's own sub-line grammar,
  **"Ask what this channel is linked to now."**: a bare sparkle item in a menu
  whose every other action self-describes was the one control a reader could
  not identify ("no idea what it does or why it's in this menu"). Only the stale
  refusal carries that line; an ordinary failure keeps the bare item, as the
  hand-off reads everywhere else in the dashboard. A body naming
  the channel without a token is refused the same way (the caller tried to
  name a row and failed — never the unconditional clear); a body that is
  present but not valid JSON, or not a JSON object, is 400 `invalid_body` and
  clears nothing (reading it as "no body" would hand a caller that garbled its
  row the unconditional clear); only an EMPTY body keeps the unconditional
  clear for callers that hold no row.
  The Unlink item names its outcome under its label — for a two-way binding
  "Removes the connection — X stops driving this session. Reconnect anytime
  from the session menu.", for a one-way mirror "Removes the connection —
  replies stop going to X. Reconnect anytime from the session menu." — and
  every connected
  row's toggle reads **`Pause replies to X`** — the Disconnect action labelled
  for what it does, the symmetric twin of `Resume replies to X`, because
  "disconnect" everywhere else in life means sever and a reader read the row
  right only through its sub-line ("'disconnect' and 'pauses' pull in different
  directions"); a label change only, #3006's pause semantics stand — and carries
  **"The connection stays."** — a full sentence, ended like `still_linked`'s,
  because the unpunctuated form read as "cut off, like a sentence missing its
  ending" (every sub-line says "the
  connection", never "the link": "Copy link" a few items up means a web address,
  and one word for two things in one menu read as a collision), because stacked under Disconnect the
  two verbs read as near-synonyms and a reader who cannot tell the temporary one
  from the permanent one clicks neither; a line under Unlink alone cannot
  separate them (with nothing under Disconnect there is no second term to
  compare against), and a bare removal verb reads as hard to undo, so the Unlink
  line also says that reconnecting brings the link back and where that lives:
  a reader who understood the verb still would not click it without knowing
  how easy the way back is. The way back is its own sentence: as a third
  dash-clause ("... until you reconnect — from the session menu.") the place
  attached to the nearest verb and parsed as "removes the link from the session
  menu". The place is named as "the session menu", not "this
  menu", because the same rows also open under the paused header chip and an
  unlink from there removes the chip and its menu. The Unlink line no longer
  names the kind of link: "two-way link" made a reader pause on the one control
  that ends the lock-out ("I'd pause first because I don't fully understand
  'two-way link'"), and the tail carries what stops. The direction itself is
  an explicit label on every BOUND row, rendered from the row's
  `drives_session` in the menus' right-aligned tag grammar — **"Two-way · X ↔
  this session"** for a binding that drives this session, **"One-way · this
  session → X"** for a one-way mirror; an offer, bound to nothing, carries
  none — and the paused sub-line (`still_linked`, one string) carries no
  direction at all: two rows that looked alike carried captions that flipped
  between "messages there still reach this session" and "don't reach" with
  nothing marking why, and a reader who met both stopped trusting either ("I
  cannot tell which is true … I no longer trust the captions"). The Unlink
  line keeps its two tails (`unlink_outcome` / `_out`), because what a sever
  STOPS genuinely differs, and the label above it is what makes the two tails
  read as two kinds of link rather than as one caption that contradicts
  itself. The pair defines each
  other: one pauses and keeps the link, the other removes it and names
  reconnecting (the menu offers the same destination as a fresh `Connect` row
  right after) as what brings it back. The pause row's line is not limited to
  rows with an Unlink beneath them: a reader who has learned it on a mirrored
  session's menu and then meets a bare `Pause replies to X` on a born-in channel
  cannot tell whether that one keeps the conversation bound, and the line is
  true there too —
  the conversation stays bound and a reply there resumes it. Which direction
  label a row carries, and which Unlink tail, is the row's own
  `drives_session` — the slots projection's statement,
  per link row, that messages sent there land in this session — never an
  inference from the wire's `direction` or the channel name: a Slack thread row
  is projected `out` (its inbound routing is Slack's own thread index, not the
  mirror's inbound marker) yet a reply in a linked thread resumes this session
  while the link stands and Unlink evicts that index, so the projection marks
  it `drives_session: true`; a `both` mirror is `true` by its inbound marker, a
  one-way `out` mirror `false`, and the conversation a session was born in
  `true`. The server owns the routing fact; a client that re-derives it reads
  a paused Slack row as a one-way link. A row from a cached payload
  without the field reads as not driving until the next slots push.
- `POST /api/chat/slots/{name}/slack-pause` | `mirror-pause` — disconnect (or
  reconnect) a channel while **retaining** its binding, so inbound still routes
  to the same session and a later reconnect needs no re-link. Same auth posture
  as the link/unlink pair. Body `{paused: bool}`; `mirror-pause` also takes
  `{origin: bool}` naming WHICH non-Slack delivery is meant, because a session
  can hold two at once and they mute independently. Returns 409
  `mirror_not_linked` when the named delivery does not exist. The disconnect
  itself is never governance-gated (it only ever reduces egress); a denial
  silences the courtesy note posted into the conversation and keeps the
  disconnect. That note is skipped entirely for an `origin` disconnect, since the
  mirror resolver addresses the EXPLICIT mirror — a different conversation.
  Because the binding survives, the UI names the state rather than letting a
  paused channel read like one that was never connected: the menu row reads
  `Resume replies to X` — the verb names the state its sub-line describes; under
  a line saying the connection still stands, `Connect to X` read as a second link
  rather than a resume ("the title says 'Connect' but the small text describes
  the current paused state… I would not be confident which one I was about to
  do"). Every paused BOUND row reads it, a paused born-in conversation too:
  that row carries the direction tag, and a bare `Connect` under a tag
  asserting the connection stands is the same contradiction. Only a
  never-connected offer, which asserts no connection, keeps `Connect to X`. Every
  paused bound row carries a consequence line under the verb —
  **"Replies paused — the connection stays."**, the born-in row included (with
  only the verb saying it, a reader found the menu itself said "paused"
  nowhere), the
  direction on the row's label, not in the line (a consequence, not the word "linked",
  which collided with the neighbouring "Copy link" item; and led by what is
  paused, not by "Disconnected", which under a row reading `Connect` contradicted
  itself)
  — and a severable row keeps its `Unlink from X` item; a born-in row carries
  beneath that line the note that explains its missing Unlink, **"Started from
  X — the connection can be paused, not removed."**, connected or paused,
  because a reader who meets a
  mirrored channel's two controls and this channel's one could not tell "why one
  connected chat gets both choices and this one only gets the pause". **X is
  the label the server sends**, everywhere the destination is named: a bound
  row (and its failure lines) reads its link row's `label` as the slots
  projection spells it, the header chip reads the same row's label, and an
  offer reads the target's `label` from `channel-targets` — the same channel
  form with the destination on it ("Discord DM · 1234"), the one thing an
  offer must add since several destinations on one channel can be offered at
  once. On the offer row that label is split at its ` · `: the verb line keeps
  the channel form (`Connect to Discord DM`, the name the bound row and the chip
  use) and the discriminator is the row's muted sub-line — a human tail as the
  transport sent it ("#eng", "Direct Message", "yourself"), a tail that is
  nothing but the id of a `user:` target named for what it is (**"Direct
  message · 118273645"**) — because a raw id inside a button label read as
  broken ("I don't know whose number that is") and the reconnect path Unlink
  promises lands on exactly that row; an unavailable offer keeps the
  discriminator above its reason. The dashboard keeps no brand table of its own for these names (its
  `channelBrandLabel` is only the fallback for a wire row that carries no
  label): one destination used to carry three names across the journey —
  the chip's "Discord DM", the row's "Discord", the offer's "Discord DM ·
  1234" — and a reader "could not tell why one is more specific than the
  other, or whether they do different things"; the header chip for a two-way binding
  reads **"Driven from X · replies paused"** (live: "Driven from X"; unlinked:
  no chip). Both states are ONE affordance — a menu trigger (with a chevron as
  its visible cue) that opens the session menu's own Linked surfaces rows FOR
  THE CHANNEL IT NAMES, right under the chip: for the paused chip the
  `Resume replies to X` row that resumes and the `Unlink from X` row, with
  "Resume or unlink X." as its `title`; for the live chip the `Pause replies to
  X` and `Unlink from X` rows, with "Pause or unlink X." as its `title`; no
  other channel's rows and no offers (a chip that reads "Driven from Discord DM"
  must not open a menu offering Slack or Telegram). The paused chip is the one
  that invites repair — a chip that
  names a problem and answers a click with nothing is a dead click at the moment
  of need; a hover-only hint did not cure that (delayed, absent on touch,
  unread by a screen reader) — and the live chip is the same trigger because a
  button beside a plain span that looked identical gave one chip two behaviours
  a reader could not tell apart before clicking. It is not a second control: the
  rows are the one component that connects, pauses and unlinks, so the chip
  cannot disagree with the menu about what any verb means. Three states, each
  spelled differently, because the middle one is the one session control still
  refuses. **Link, pause and unlink publish only after the SessionMap write is
  durable**: the map's writer is debounced, so `mirror-link`, `mirror-pause`,
  `mirror-unlink`, `slack-link`, `slack-pause` and `slack-unlink` each `await
  state.sessions.aflush()` between the map write and the first thing that
  reports it done (the slots push, the note or backfill in the channel, the
  response) — a gateway exit before the deferred write would otherwise reload an
  unlinked binding on restart, lift a pause the user set, or lose a link whose
  thread already carries the transcript, and make the reported state a lie.
  (`mirror-link`'s claim runs off the loop, where a batch writes inline; its
  await is the same visible contract, normally finding nothing owed.) A failed
  flush surfaces as the route's error, never as `ok`; on `slack-unlink` the slot's
  own fields and the thread's reverse-index entry are torn down in a `finally`
  around the flush, so they follow the in-memory map in failure too — a teardown
  skipped by the raise would leave the row rendering, a reply in the thread
  resolving to the slot, and a retried Unlink refused with nothing to compare.
  They follow the map literally: the teardown is conditional on what the map
  holds once the wait returns. The write is a real thread hop and a second
  same-slot `slack-link` can run its whole handler inside it, so a link the map
  holds afterwards is that newer write (the route cleared the old one), whatever
  its thread — its fields and index stand, the thread gets no "unlinked" note and
  no struck control, and the answer carries `relinked: true`; an empty map means
  the old binding's fields and index are the ones to take down.
  Pinned in `test_channel_connect_row.py::TestPersistBeforePublish`, one test
  per route, and `test_chat_slack.py::TestSlackUnlink::test_a_failed_flush_still_tears_down_the_slot_and_the_reverse_index`, `::test_a_relink_that_lands_inside_the_flush_window_survives_the_unlink` and `::test_a_plain_unlink_still_tears_down_the_slot_and_the_reverse_index`.
- **Neither `mirror-unlink` nor `mirror-pause` detaches a channel-born slot.** Both
  act on the outbound mirror binding only (clear it, or mute delivery through it);
  the slot's `linked_session_key` — the channel session its turns run on — is
  untouched, inbound keeps routing to it, and nothing about what session control
  or the work ledger decide for that slot changes. Those gates judge a channel-born
  slot by `session_control.owner_dm_refusal`, whose one exemption is a 1:1 DM
  whose only human is the configured owner (see
  [session-control](session-control.md)); a thread session is refused before and
  after either endpoint, and an owner DM is admitted before and after — a paused or
  cleared origin mirror is still the same audience. "Cleared" is the store's word,
  not an empty row: `clear_mirror_link` pops the `mirror` row and leaves the
  namespaced bucket the first inbound turn's `set_channel` stamped into the legacy
  `slack_channel_id` field, and `get_mirror_link` reads that threadless Slack row as
  no mirror at the source (a row naming no thread is never synthesized into one),
  so the predicate — and every other reader — sees `None`. The one dashboard action that DOES change the
  verdict is `slack-link` on a channel-born slot: it binds the thread on the slot's
  effective key — the channel session — beside the untouched origin mirror, and the
  predicate reads that thread on its own (`get_slack_link`), because `get_mirror_link`
  answers the `mirror` row alone when one exists; the owner DM is refused as
  mirroring to a Slack thread until `slack-unlink` clears it. There is no "detach
  from channel" action: a channel conversation stays a channel conversation.
- **Three persisted pause markers, each keyed differently.** A mute must live and
  die with the binding the user muted, so the key follows what the flag is about:
  - `slack_paused` — the Slack thread. Cleared when the binding is REBOUND
    (different ts or channel), NOT on an identical-coordinate write: the Slack
    inbound path re-writes the same ts/channel every turn as its thread registry,
    so clearing on any write let one inbound message silently un-disconnect a
    thread.
  - `mirror_paused` — the explicit `mirror` binding. Read/written through
    `_mirror_key`, following the binding between the canonical row and the legacy
    `dashboard:` spelling.
  - `origin_paused` — the conversation the session was BORN in. Read/written on
    the CANONICAL row, never through `_mirror_key`: that helper migrates rows
    depending on where a MIRROR lives, which stranded the pause the moment a
    mirror landed on the canonical row.
  Each existence check is per flag: a born-in conversation is permanent, while an
  explicit mirror must actually exist, so a flag with nothing behind it reads as
  connected rather than reporting a session that delivers nowhere as merely quiet.
  Enforcement lives at the send sites, not in storage — see
  [messaging](messaging.md) for the `SilentRenderer` substitution that stops a
  disconnected non-Slack conversation being written to.
- `GET /api/chat/channel-targets` — owner-authenticated union of Slack
  destinations and every registered transport's configured targets. The
  dashboard session menu renders this list with per-channel brand icons.
  Unavailable configured destinations are returned with a reason rather than
  silently omitted (Teams before first inbound; WeCom proactive send); the menu
  keeps those rows keyboard-focusable, shows the reason inline, and announces
  the same reason instead of presenting an unexplained disabled action.
- In-channel `/link` / `/unlink` — `/link` writes the link on the current
  conversation's `legacy_dashboard_mirror_key`; it does not control display, history,
  or the inbound direction — only the outbound echo. `/unlink` frees the
  LOCATION via the shared `messaging.link.release_conversation_location`
  helper (one implementation for every DM dispatcher): after the key-addressed
  clears it sweeps every binding whose mirror targets this conversation
  (`clear_mirror_links_at`), including a binding stranded under a rotated DM
  generation and another dashboard session's outbound mirror into the
  conversation — the same occupant set the Discord resume conflict check
  refuses on, so its "Run `!unlink` first" guidance is always followable. The
  reply reports the count when more than one binding was cleared.

**Delivery** (`chat_runner._deliver_cross_surface_reply` /
`_deliver_cross_surface_user_message`, via the shared `_resolve_mirror_target`
preamble) is best-effort and gated on: Slack skipped (its own inline mirror); a
registered transport with `supports_proactive_send` (WeCom is False → `/link`
rejected there); and the `channels` governance ceiling via
`governance_permits("channels", channel_type)`, so an operator policy
restricting outbound messaging is honored on this egress too (fail-closed on any
governance error — matching the Slack path). Egress text is redacted through the
canonical `redact_via_context` shim so a loaded companion's extra
credential/token regexes apply.

**Known asymmetry / future work.** Slack already runs the unified one-session
model; the other transports run two sessions bridged by the mirror. Folding the
dashboard channel tab into the channel session (as Slack does) would remove the
second sid and the live render-duplication it can cause, at the cost of a
dashboard-turn-loop refactor.

## Removing a session from the registry: record the end

**Every path that removes an entry from `_sessions` must report that removal to
`metrics/sessions.py`** — with `await record_session_ended(key, end_reason=...)` for
a session that lived, `await record_sessions_ended(keys, end_reason=...)` for a path
that drains many at once, or `await discard_session_start(key)` for a registration
being rolled back before it ever became one. All three are coroutines: the
breadcrumb unlink is a filesystem syscall and must not run on the event loop, where
a slow or network-backed data home would park every gateway task behind one closing
session. This is a correctness requirement on lifecycle code, not a telemetry
nicety, and it is documented here rather than only in the metrics module because the
people who can break it are editing this subsystem.

The reason it matters more than a missing sample: a session start writes a
breadcrumb file that survives process death, which is what lets a session killed
with its gateway be counted at all. A removal that reports nothing leaves that
breadcrumb behind, and the next boot reads a surviving breadcrumb as a crash. So
an unrecorded removal does not lose a data point — it **fabricates a crash that
never happened**, inside the one population the instrument exists to expose.

Practical rules when you add or change a removal path:

- Report it while you still hold the session registry lock, in the same tick as the
  `pop` / `del` / `clear`. The call's own pop and histogram record happen before its
  single suspension point, and holding the lock across that point is what keeps a
  racing cold start from registering a successor under the same key and having its
  record consumed by the predecessor's teardown. Reporting AFTER the path's other
  awaits is the bug this rule exists to prevent.
- Drain many keys with ONE `record_sessions_ended` call, never a loop of
  `record_session_ended` awaits. A per-key await puts a cancellation point between
  two keys, so every key after it is popped but unrecorded — and on `close_all`,
  which a cancellation reaches by design, that fabricates a crash per remaining
  session.
- Keep your MANDATORY post-pop cleanup reachable. All three recording coroutines
  absorb a cancellation at their crumb hop for exactly this reason, so the call
  itself will not abort you — but the rule that makes that safe is yours to hold:
  once you have popped the registry you are past the point of no return, so the
  session-map mutation that finishes the teardown (`destroy`'s `delete`,
  `discard_conversation`'s and `reset`'s `clear_sid`) must not sit behind a
  suspension point that can be skipped. Put it in a `finally` that covers every
  await after the pop, and never add a bare `await` between the pop and it.
- Give it its own `end_reason` if it is genuinely a different event. The enum is
  closed and lives in `metrics/sessions.py`; reusing a label merges two
  populations, and a metric is not a good reason to grow a lifecycle signature.
- A registration cancelled mid-flight is NOT an end. Use `discard_session_start`,
  which consumes the breadcrumb without emitting a lifetime.

`test/metrics/test_session_duration.py::TestEveryRegistryRemovalRecordsAnEnd`
enforces this. It is fail-closed and discovers its own scope: an AST walk over
every module under `src/kiro_crew` that mentions `_sessions`, recognising the
`pop`, `del` and `clear` spellings, so a new removal path anywhere fails the gate
the day it lands rather than waiting to be added to a list. A container that
merely shares the attribute name can be exempted with a stated reason, and the
exemption self-voids if that module ever starts writing breadcrumbs.

**`reset` keeps the popped session readable for exactly the life of its teardown.**
The pop happens under the registry lock before the awaits that can hang (the end
record, the unlink, the child probes, the provider shutdown), so from the pop to
the end of the teardown the live map does not name the process the teardown holds.
A reader that must still reach that process — the cron reaper, when a run's OWN
`finally` reset popped the session and then hung, the ordinary shape of a run that
hangs in its teardown — reads `SessionManager.tearing_down(key)`. The facade opens
a `_TeardownScope` around every `reset`; `SessionLifecycleService.reset` records
the popped session into it in the same lock hold as the pop, and the scope's exit
releases the entry however the call ends (return, a deferred shutdown error, a
cancellation landing on the hung shutdown). Every teardown in flight under the
key is retained, in pop order (`tearing_down(key)` returns the list): a cold start
can register a successor while the first teardown hangs, and that successor's own
reset can pop it and hang as well -- a reader ending the key must reach BOTH
processes, and a table that kept the first popper alone hid the hung successor
behind a record that said `reaped`. Each entry is a `TornDown` record: the popped
session AND the `ProcessHandle` read off it in the pop's own lock hold
(`process_identity.process_handle_of`), never re-read — the teardown's own awaits
clear the ACP client's recorded pid after a kill it could not confirm, with the
process still standing, so a reader that re-read the retained session found no pid
and named no process while it lived; the reader kills on the entry's `handle`. Each
scope removes exactly the entry it
recorded, by the session's identity, when its own teardown ends. Bounded by construction: an
entry lives exactly as long as the reset coroutine that recorded it, which already
holds that session, so the table adds a reference per teardown in flight and never
a lifetime. A caller that must know exactly which session ITS reset popped opens the scope itself (`SessionManager.teardown_scope(on_pop=...)`, passed to `reset` as `scope`): `on_pop` runs in the same lock hold as the pop, handed that session -- how the cron reaper takes the handle of the process a timed-out reset holds. A `SessionLifecycleService.reset` called without a scope records
nothing; the facade is the caller that opens one. `test_session.py::
TestResetRetainsTheTornDownSession` pins the entry's life; the cron module spec
records what the reaper does with it.

**A key whose run is being ended admits nothing -- and drops nothing: the per-key
ending fence.** `SessionManager.ending_key(key)` is a context manager, the per-key
sibling of the manager-wide `_closing` check, held by a caller that is ending a
run (the cron reaper, `cancel()`, and the sub-agent manager's force reap -- a
deadline, a startup stall, a dashboard Stop -- through
`process_identity.ending_fence`, the one entry both supervisors use) from before its reset-then-kill passes until the
run's terminal record and audit are written: a caller held at the door wakes to a
key whose run is RECORDED, never to one that is neither being ended nor recorded
(runtime and durable state agreeing; a registration after the passes is a new life
under the key, not the run's process, and it follows the record). It raises
synchronously on entry (`SessionAllocationService.begin_ending`, before the
holder's first await) and lifts however the block ends (`end_ending`). While it
is up, a claim or a cold start under the key is HELD at the front door of
`get_or_create`: the call takes no reservation, waits outside the registry lock
for the fence's lift event (`SessionRegistryState.ending_lifted`, set by
`end_ending`; `wait_for_ending_fence`) and then proceeds -- so a sub-agent
completion that races the reap of its parent's run is delivered into the session
that follows the record, as it was before the fence existed, never into the run
being ended and never dropped. The wait is bounded by `ENDING_FENCE_WAIT_SECS`
(180 s: an independent caller-refusal bound, not a multiple of the fence's length
-- a reset cancelled at its timeout still finishes its cleanup inside the pass, so
no duration is derived from the passes -- fixed well inside the 1200 s the
completion path allows its whole delivery); a fence still up
at that point is a holder stuck past its bounds, and the caller is refused with
`SessionEndingError` so the defect surfaces rather than hanging every caller of
the key. The front door is not the whole rule: `get_or_create` takes its
allocation reservation and then awaits `provider.start()` BEFORE publishing into
the map, so a cold start caught inside `start()` when the fence goes up has
published nothing the holder's passes could see. `begin_ending` therefore
INVALIDATES every reservation in flight under the key at that moment
(`SessionRegistryState.invalidated_reservations`, keyed by the reservation token
`get_or_create` threads into `_get_or_create_impl`): the body's doors -- the
claim of a live session, that claim again once its wait on the busy turn's
permit ends (`_reacquire_and_validate`, under the lock, before the session is
handed back: the wait can outlast a fence rising, and the turn's ordinary
release would otherwise hand the permit to the waiter before the holder's reset
pops the session), the cold start before it spawns, the registration after
`provider.start()` -- refuse that call (`_refuse_if_ending`; the reacquire door
releases the permit it just took), the provider it
started is hard-killed by the same `except BaseException` path a closing manager
uses, and `get_or_create` then removes the reservation, waits for the lift and
allocates again, so the held request lands with a fresh provider; the
invalidation lives exactly as long as the reservation (dropped in
`_remove_reservation_now`). A reservation taken after the fence lifts is a new
life under the key and is not invalidated. A reservation is not yet a process:
`SessionRegistryState.spawning_reservations` marks a reservation from the
pre-spawn fence check (the spawn door) -- or from a warm-pool claim, which owns a
live process from the claim on -- until registration (published, or a won
race -- cleared in the same lock hold, with no await between), and
`SessionManager._spawn_in_flight(key)` (`spawn_in_flight`, a reason phrase or
None) is the read the holder makes after its passes to name a start it did not
itself answer -- a cold start inside `provider.start()`, refused and hard-killed
when it returns. A start that returns DURING the passes is refused at once and its
reservation removed, so it leaves a receipt instead
(`SessionRegistryState.refused_spawns`, written by `_remove_reservation_now` while
the key's fence is up, cleared by `end_ending`): the hard kill the refusal
dispatched runs off the loop with no outcome read back, so the holder names it
too ("refused at registration during the ending ... an outcome this record does
not confirm") rather than recording `reaped` over a process the cleanup had
erased every trace of; a refusal after the lift leaves no receipt, since the
record it could inform is already written. A claim waiting on the live session's
turn semaphore, or a cold start still ahead of its spawn door, holds a reservation
but is NOT named: it started nothing, is woken or held, and lands after the record
(naming it recorded a kill failure over a clean reap). A caller held at the front
door holds no reservation at all. `open_task_session`, the other
publication door, is refused at its entry while the fence is up rather than held:
it holds no reservation and creates on a shared runtime with no hard-kill path, so
a per-step create already in flight is what the ending caller's post-pass read of
the key remains the net for. Additive to the allocation-boundary predecessor
capture: new state fields, new methods, and door checks as separate statements.
`test_session.py::TestTheEndingFenceAdmitsNothingUnderTheKey` pins the held front
door (cold start and claim), the in-flight invalidation with the hard kill and the
re-allocation (fence up when the start returns, and lifted before), the pre-start
variant, the spawn read (a start inside `start()` is a spawn in flight; a claim
waiting on the turn and a reservation ahead of its spawn door are not), the wait
bound, the lift, and the task-session door; the cron module spec records what
the reaper does with the fence, including holding it through the record.

## Security: PreToolUse Command Enforcement

Command denial is enforced by Kiro Crew's bundled `hooks.py` `PreToolUse` gate,
not by injecting `deniedCommands` into kiro agent specs. Agent config generation
keeps the bundled security hooks as the immutable base, merges user hooks after
them, and strips retired `deniedCommands` / `autoAllowReadonly` fields left by an
older installation. Session startup and periodic cleanup do not rewrite agent
configs.

## Orphaned MCP Server Cleanup

`_cleanup_orphaned_mcp_servers()` kills MCP server processes that survived
session teardown.  kiro-cli-chat spawns MCP servers (kiro_crew mcp-core/cron,
the internal MCP server, slack-mcp) in separate process groups.  When a
session dies, `killpg` only reaches the kiro-cli process group — MCP servers
in other groups get reparented to init and leak memory.

**Tracking**: both transports snapshot their descendant PIDs and persist
them to `kiro_pids.txt` as `child_pid:parent_pid[:start-id]` entries —
`AcpClient` appends them with `_track_child_pids(pids, parent_pid=<root pid>)`,
`AcpRuntime` rewrites its root's whole block with `_replace_child_pids` (see
below); the third field is the
child's process-start identity (`_pid_start_token`, colon-free, in-process
and non-blocking on every platform), omitted only when unreadable at track
time.  `AcpClient` snapshots in `ensure_ready()`.  `AcpRuntime` snapshots in
`_snapshot_descendants()`, called repeatedly for a reason the one-shot client
scan does not face: the runtime's registered PID is the sandbox launcher, and
the tree under it is `launcher -> agent -> agent chat process -> MCP servers`,
so the scan runs when the initialize handshake proves the agent came up and
then at the end of every `_finish_create_session()` and `load_session()`,
because each session start — fresh or resumed — forks another agent process
and re-initializes MCP servers the earlier scan could not have seen.

Nothing announces a descendant's exit: they are the gateway's
GRANDchildren, so there is no `SIGCHLD` to catch and no wait to reap (the
gateway does not set `PR_SET_CHILD_SUBREAPER`).  Looking is the only way to
learn, so each pass re-enumerates the tree and writes the whole answer through
`_replace_child_pids(records, parent_pid=<root>, drop=<gone>)` — one lock, one
atomic rewrite, a `bool` back.

One rule governs every field-3 write, and the reason is asymmetric harm.  A
token that is stale costs a MISSED reap: the sweep compares live against
recorded, sees them differ, and prunes the line without killing — a leak, and
the sweep still reports it.  A token that names the wrong process costs a WRONG
KILL: live and recorded agree (both the stranger's), the recycle guard does not
fire, and `_cleanup_orphaned_mcp_servers` signals a process that merely reused
the number.  So when identity is in doubt the answer is always "do not record",
never "record whatever holds the number now":

> **An identity may be written only if it was captured while that pid was
> confirmed to be ours.**

Everything else follows from it:

- **The writer never reads a live identity.**  `_replace_child_pids` persists
  `_recorded_start_token` of the mapping's value — the token its caller
  captured — and calls no reader of its own.  An append-based writer had no
  such hazard because it never refreshed field 3 at all.
- **A pid in the tree is confirmed by a second walk before its fresh identity
  is kept.**  One released between the enumeration and the capture can be held
  by an unrelated process when its identity is read; absent from the second
  walk it is not a descendant of this root, and it is dropped.  The window is
  not closed — crossing it now needs a pid to become a stranger and then become
  our descendant again.
- **A pid outside the tree is kept by IDENTITY, not liveness.**
  `_escapee_is_still_ours` compares its live start id against the recorded one.
  Liveness alone is the kill-a-stranger case: a descendant that exited and had
  its number taken reads as alive.  A match keeps the child that left the
  process group, whose record is the only handle anything has on it; a mismatch,
  an unreadable identity and an exit are all "not ours" and drop the line.
- **The root is bracketed too.**  `_root_identity_holds` compares the runtime's
  own pid against the start id recorded at spawn, before the first walk and
  again before the write, because a walk from a recycled root enumerates a
  stranger's whole tree.  No recorded identity means nothing is recorded.
- **Only the caller's own children are rewritten.**  A line is removed when its
  child pid is named in `records` or in `drop`, never merely for sitting under
  this `parent_pid`: a root pid is reused like any other, and a descendant that
  outlived an earlier runtime holding this number is still tracked under it.
- **One pass at a time per runtime.**  Each pass rewrites the block from what it
  read, so two overlapping passes let the older read win and drop the newer
  descendants; sessions start concurrently on a shared runtime, so the pass is
  serialized on a per-runtime lock.
- **The file is written before the in-memory record.**  A `False` publishes
  nothing, so the record never claims a line the file does not carry, and the
  next pass retries.
- **A failure never raises, a cancellation always does.**  Losing a snapshot
  must not fail a live session, so every `Exception` is logged at WARNING and
  swallowed.  A `CancelledError` is not a failure and reaches the caller's
  cleanup guard, which kills the half-built runtime or terminates the session
  it owns.

On clean shutdown each transport prunes entries by the DESCENDANT's own
liveness, never by the root's fate: `AcpClient._reset_state()` and
`AcpRuntime._kill_inner()` (through `_prune_dead_descendants`) untrack only the
children confirmed gone and log the survivors at WARNING.  A child that
escaped the group kill by calling `setsid` keeps its entry, because that entry
is the only handle the periodic sweep and the next startup cleanup have on it.

A root that is already gone when teardown runs is handled on the runtime path
by `AcpRuntime._signal_tree` → `_signal_orphaned_runtime_group`: the group id
is the root pid (a session leader), and the group's MEMBERS are signalled, each
re-verified by start id at the instant of the signal — never the group number,
which can be handed to a fresh session leader at any moment.  A member counts
once `_marked_group_members` finds it carrying this spawn's
`KIROCREW_SPAWN_INSTANCE` (the per-spawn token on the root's environment, the
one thing a fresh runtime on a recycled root pid cannot share) together with
`KIROCREW_SPAWNED` and a runtime argv identity.  This is the tree the snapshot
cannot cover — a root that died before its first scan — and the tracked sweep
cannot either, since nothing was recorded.  Linux only; see
[acp-client](acp-client.md).

Every `/proc/<pid>/stat` and `status` read on these teardown, sweep and reclaim
paths is a BYTES read through `platform_compat` (`read_proc_stat`,
`read_proc_status_int`, `linux_pgroup_members`, `proc_child_map`,
`get_process_start_identity`), so a process whose name is not UTF-8 -- a
multibyte script name cut at the kernel's 15 bytes is enough -- is seen like any
other. That covers the root's exit check (`_pid_exited_but_unreaped`: a zombie
or a pid that is gone has exited, a present pid whose state cannot be read has
not), both group scans (`_pgroup_has_member_besides`, `_marked_group_members`,
which takes each member's start id from the same read that admitted it), the
session-leader check the orphan-work sweep and the reconciler ask
(`_linux_session_leader_alive`: only a leader that is gone or reads another
session, a kernel thread's session 0 included, counts as ended), the parent edges (`get_ppid`, `_is_our_descendant`,
`_pid_parent_and_token`, `_our_orphan_pids`), the child map, the reconciler's
process table, the ages (`_pid_age_seconds`, `_linux_pid_age`) and the RSS reads
the recycle ceilings judge by.

If the gateway crashes, the entries remain in the file for the next startup.

**Detection**: reads `kiro_pids.txt`, processes only `child:parent` lines
(bare PID lines are kiro-cli parents handled by `cleanup_orphaned_sessions()`).
If the child is alive but its parent PID is dead, the child is orphaned and
killed.  Two guards run first.  The start identity (entries carrying the
start-id field) is subtractive evidence: a live `_pid_start_token` that
differs from the recorded one proves the PID was recycled, and the stale
entry is pruned without killing.  A matching or unreadable token never
authorizes the kill by itself -- the tracking file is same-uid-writable, so
a forged line must not aim the sweep at an arbitrary process.  The kill is
authorized only by the reparent heuristic: a genuine orphan reparented to
init (pid 1), or still showing the dead parent's PID (kill/reparent race),
is killed outright, while a PPid in the same-uid `systemd --user` subreaper
set -- the same accepted-parent set `_our_orphan_pids()` uses, computed by
the shared `_accepted_subreaper_pids()` -- additionally requires BOTH the
`KIROCREW_SPAWNED` environ marker AND positive runtime argv identity
(`_tracked_child_has_runtime_identity`: managed agent runtime, MCP
entrypoint, or marked launcher shape; unreadable argv fails closed), because
every manager-started user service holds the manager's PID as its PPid for
its whole life and the marker is tree-wide, inherited even by intentional
survivors.  Any other PPid means recycled: pruned without killing.

**Why not ancestor walk?** MCP servers are spawned in separate process groups
and immediately reparented to init (ppid=1) even while the session is alive.
Walking the process tree would always conclude they are orphaned.  Storing the
parent PID explicitly avoids this.

**Safety**:
- Zero false positives — only kills PIDs we tracked, only when the specific
  parent session that spawned them is confirmed dead
- Dead children are silently pruned from the file
- Bare PID lines (kiro-cli parents) are ignored by MCP cleanup

**Invocation**:
- **At startup**: `cleanup_orphaned_sessions()` calls it after PID-file cleanup
- **Periodic**: `_cleanup_loop()` calls it alongside idle session expiry (~60s)
- **At shutdown**: `cleanup_orphaned_sessions()` on signal/exit

### Unreachable gatewayd reclamation

`mcp_gateway.gatewayd` daemons are their own session/process-group leaders
(`start_new_session=True`), so a launcher that dies without signalling one
(pytest teardown is the common case) leaves it resident forever — `killpg`
from the launcher's tree cannot reach it, and the marker-based orphan sweep
excludes gateway entrypoints (`_GATEWAY_MARKERS`) because a cmdline alone
cannot distinguish a live dev pod's daemon from a dead launcher's. Two layers
close the leak, both keyed on the one reachability signal that IS observable:
the daemon's `--socket` path. gatewayd creates that socket at bind, so once
the path is absent from disk no stub can ever connect again — the process is
provably unreachable regardless of who launched it.

- **Self-exit (primary, in-daemon)**: `mcp_gateway/daemon/sweepers.py::_socket_liveness_sweeper`
  stats its own socket path on the idle-sweep cadence, armed only after a
  successful bind. Three CONSECUTIVE `ENOENT` observations set `stop_event`,
  taking the same graceful drain as SIGTERM (backends drained and reaped).
  Any other stat failure (EACCES/EIO) is inconclusive and never counts.
  POSIX-only — a Windows named pipe has no directory entry to observe.
- **Sweep-side reap (defense in depth)**: `_is_sweepable_orphan_gatewayd` is
  a fourth positive-identity path in the untracked orphan sweep. It overrides
  the `_GATEWAY_MARKERS` exclusion only for a structural
  `-m kiro_crew.mcp_gateway.gatewayd` argv whose `--socket` path is gone
  (NUL-separated argv only — the space-joined `ps` fallback cannot delimit
  paths safely and fails closed, so the path is effectively Linux-only).
  `kiro_crew.cli` / `kiro_crew.__main__` stay unconditionally excluded. The
  kill is TERM-first (`_kill_orphan_gatewayd`) so the daemon drains its own
  pooled backends, escalating to `killpg` SIGKILL only after the daemon's full
  `TOTAL_SHUTDOWN_BUDGET_SECS` (shared with the supervisor's SIGTERM→SIGKILL
  grace, so a correctly-draining daemon is never killed mid-drain), with a
  cmdline re-verify guarding PID recycling. Same-uid + reparented-to-init
  candidacy, the age floor, and the kill budget all still apply.

### session_pid sidecar contract (`session_pid_sig.py`)

The gateway maps its direct child pid to a session key by publishing
`config_dir()/session_pid_<pid>.txt` on session claim (writers:
`dashboard/chat_runner.py`, `slack/handler.py` — both route through
`session_pid_sig.publish_session_pid`, the single legitimate publish path).
Because the `.txt` lives in the same-uid agent-writable config dir it is NOT
a trust root on its own; publication therefore also writes a
`session_pid_<pid>.sig` sidecar:

- **MAC**: HMAC-SHA256 over `"<pid>:<body>"`, where *body* is the full
  published `.txt` content — the session key alone (legacy),
  `"<session_key>\n<start_token>"` (recycle-guarded, below), or those plus the
  tenant section (shared-runtime, below). The pid is bound
  into the MAC so one pid's pair cannot be replayed under another pid, and
  covering the whole body signs the start token too — flipping only the token
  invalidates the MAC. A legacy body yields a byte-identical message to the
  pre-token scheme, so mappings signed before the format change still verify.
- **Tenant section** (shared runtime): one kiro-cli process hosts several ACP
  sessions — a `spawn_run` subagent on its parent's runtime, a workflow pool
  worker — while the mapping names ONE. Publication therefore records the set
  of sessions sharing the pid, inside the same MAC, and the section is written
  ONLY above one session, so a 1:1 pid produces byte-identical output to the
  scheme above and an older reader still parses it. The set comes from
  `SessionManager.runtime_pids()`, filtered to rows carrying `sid`: that
  snapshot also appends one row per manager-owned companion RUNTIME whose `key`
  is display text, and a subagent runtime is frequently the runtime a session is
  already served by, so counting those rows would record two tenants for a pid
  hosting one session. The section is size-bounded, so a runtime with many
  sessions records the true count while dropping members — a short membership
  is INCOMPLETE, never a closed set.
  Readers ask two different questions of it and must not share an answer:
  a reader resolving its OWN identity treats a recorded count above one as a
  refusal (no single key names it), while a reader VERIFYING a key someone else
  declared checks membership. Absence of the section is UNKNOWN, never
  "not shared": a manager that cannot answer must not make readers confident
  about a pid it has no evidence for.
- **Shared-pid attestation**: membership is necessary but NOT sufficient for a
  declared key, because the `.txt` is agent-readable — a co-tenant could read a
  sibling's key out of the roster and declare it. A pid demonstrably hosting
  several sessions therefore also requires an `X-Session-Token` resolving to
  exactly the declared key (`dashboard/token_auth.py`); the token's MAC uses the
  agent-unreadable SEL trust root and names one session, which the kernel's
  proof of the PROCESS cannot do on a shared runtime. A 1:1 pid requires no
  token: only one session lives there, so there is no other identity to mistake
  it for. Both admitted paths record which roster shape they judged, so the SEL
  trail distinguishes a declaration checked against a full membership from one
  checked against a short.
- **PID-recycle guard** (issue #8343): the mapping used to bind only the pid
  *number*, so a recycled pid kept verifying and answered for the new
  process with the previous owner's session key until the next restart's
  orphan sweep. Publication now appends the process start token
  (`platform_compat.get_process_start_id` — the same incarnation identity
  `session_pid.py` records in its `<gw>:<pid>:<start_token>` sweep entries)
  as a second line of the `.txt` (a line, not a colon field, because the
  session key itself contains colons). Both readers dual-parse legacy
  vs guarded forms and refuse on a PROVEN mismatch — the lenient reader
  included, since strict-then-lenient fallbacks (`peer_resolve`) would
  otherwise silently recover the stale attribution. An absent recorded
  token (legacy file) or an unreadable live token (Windows, exited process)
  is unknown, never a mismatch — those resolve as before. Same-uid only:
  a robustness/misattribution guard, not a privilege boundary.
- **Key**: a purpose-specific subkey derived from the SEL trust root via a
  domain-separation label (`HMAC(sel_hmac.key, "kirocrew.session_pid.sig.v1")`).
  The raw root never signs a sidecar; the sidecar protocol and the SEL audit
  chain never share a signing key (see `sel.md`). Only `SecurityEventLog`
  ever *creates* the key file.
- **Writes are atomic** (`atomic_write` → `os.replace`): a pre-planted
  symlink at the predictable paths is replaced, never followed.
- **Consumers**: STRICT identity resolvers accept the direct
  `KIROCREW_HOST_PID` → mapping lookup only via
  `session_pid_sig.verify_session_pid`, which fails closed to `""` on a
  missing/short key, missing files, or MAC mismatch, and never raises: the MAC
  is compared as bytes, so a sidecar whose text is not a hex MAC (non-ASCII
  included) is a mismatch. A `str` pid the path conversion refuses (a NUL, an
  unencodable surrogate) is a missing file; any other malformed pid reaches the
  MAC and is a mismatch. Their remaining callers are the computer-use MCP tools
  (`mcp_computer.py`, for audit attribution) and the dashboard
  messaging-identity path (`dashboard/handlers/messaging.py`).
  The former state-mutating session-bound tools that resolved identity here —
  `monitor_start`, `monitor_update`, `autonudge_stop`, `set_project` (plus
  `suggest_followup` and `ask_question`) — became STATELESS directive-return
  tools in issue #755 (see "Stateless session-directive tools" below); they
  still call the strict resolver, but only as a context guard, and no longer
  bind any effect to the key it returns. Lenient (read-only)
  resolvers keep reading the `.txt` without a signature check, but through
  the same hardened reader (`session_pid_sig.read_session_pid_txt`:
  no-follow, regular-file, size-bounded) — `session_pid_sig` owns both the
  read and write discipline for the file family. Every `.txt` reader routes
  through it: `mcp_core._resolve_session_key` (host-pid + walk),
  `mcp_shared._policy_session_key` (the policy walk, called by
  `_resolve_tool_policy`),
  `mcp_caller.CallerContext.from_env` (host-pid + walk; also serves
  `mcp_gateway/stub.py`), and `mcp_gateway/daemon/identity.py::_resolve_peer_identity`
  (server-side peer walk). The sidecar is additive. All four are pid-keyed and
  therefore answer with the PARENT for a session-sharing subagent, which is why each
  client-side one reads the per-SESSION token (`session_token_sig`) above these
  sources; the walk remains the last resort rather than the first answer.
- **Unsigned degrade**: if the SEL key is unavailable at publish time the
  `.txt` is still written (lenient readers keep working) and any stale
  sidecar is removed — strict resolvers fail closed for that pid.
- **Key rotation**: rotating/regenerating `sel_hmac.key` (e.g. snapshot
  restore, which deliberately excludes the key) invalidates every existing
  sidecar; strict resolvers fail closed until the next turn's publish
  re-signs the mapping. Benign and self-healing — no migration step.
- **Stale cleanup**: the orphan sweep removes `session_pid_<pid>.sig`
  alongside its `.txt` for dead pids (`session_pid.py`). "Dead" is not
  `pid_exists` alone: Linux numbers threads from the pid space, so a dead
  session's pid recycled as a THREAD of an unrelated live process still
  satisfies that probe and the mapping would survive forever (observed on a
  host whose pid counter had wrapped: 233 mappings, one naming a 6-day-dead
  session through a thread). `_prune_stale_session_pid_files` therefore
  removes a mapping when the pid is unsignalable, OR when it is absent from
  one `platform_compat.live_thread_group_leaders()` snapshot **and** a
  per-pid `platform_compat.is_thread_group_leader(pid)` re-read returns
  `False`. Both helpers answer `None` when the question is unknowable
  (non-Linux, unreadable `/proc`), and `None` never licenses a removal — so
  macOS and Windows keep the pre-existing `pid_exists`-only behaviour. Two
  orderings are load-bearing: the snapshot is taken AFTER the glob (a pid
  that starts in that window lands IN the set and is retained), and absence
  from it selects a *candidate* rather than the outcome, so a pid recycled
  since the snapshot — whose new owner has already republished the mapping at
  that same path — is retained by the re-read instead of losing a live
  session's identity. The snapshot costs one `/proc` directory read for the
  whole pass, which is still work the gateway boot path does not carry:
  `narrow_with_leaders=False` there per `no-new-work-on-gateway-boot-path`
  (and on the force-exit handler, which must reach its `os._exit`), while the
  graceful-shutdown sweep asks for the narrowing. This pass touches only the
  `session_pid_<pid>` family, never the shared `kiro_session_pids.txt` that
  pass 1 rewrites.
- **Cadence** (`SessionCleanup._sweep_session_pid_mappings`): the pass above is
  reached from `cleanup_orphaned_sessions` — **startup + shutdown only** — so a
  gateway that kept running held every mapping it published until it restarted,
  one per released session, and a recycled pid number went on carrying a
  dashboard slot's key (measured on a Windows host: twelve files from six
  released sessions inside an hour, two of those numbers already handed to
  unrelated live processes). The periodic cleanup tick therefore calls
  `_prune_stale_session_pid_files` as well, which is why the
  `MAX_TICK_INTERVAL_SECS` ceiling above is the other half of the same change:
  it is what makes this cadence bounded at 300s instead of derived from
  `session.timeout_secs`. Deliberately NOT hooked onto provider teardown, even
  though a teardown is the moment a runtime is known dead: `_untrack_session_pid`
  is synchronous and `AcpClient._reset_state` calls it on the event loop, so a
  mapping read or unlink placed there is filesystem work over predictable
  same-uid agent-writable paths in the one place
  `no-blocking-call-on-event-loop` forbids — a planted FIFO or reparse point
  would park the gateway. On the maintenance executor the same pass needs no
  per-syscall bounding at all, and the case a teardown hook could not reach (a
  gateway that dies without running one) is covered by the same pass.
  Retraction latency is bounded rather than immediate: a released session's
  mapping survives at most one tick. The pass keeps its own decision rules
  unchanged, deliberately — in particular it still retains a mapping whose pid
  number was recycled to a live process, because that mapping is already refused
  at READ time (`_pid_recycled` on both the strict and the lenient path) and its
  file is reclaimed once the unrelated process exits. Adding a prune branch for
  it would trade a disk saving against the read-then-unlink window in which a
  new owner's `publish_session_pid` can land, and losing a live mapping costs
  that session its identity until its next turn republishes.
- **Legacy per-pid member-memory bindings**
  (`SessionCleanup._sweep_member_pid_bindings` →
  `member_memory_auth.prune_legacy_member_pid_bindings`):
  `<crew home>/member-memory-bindings/pids/<pid>.json` and
  `<pid>.namespace.json` are records a routing path this version no longer
  carries wrote one of per agent process. Nothing deleted them and no sweep
  collected them, so they accumulate for the install's life — measured on an
  operator host at 165,975 files spanning nine days and 24 MB of directory
  inode, of which 165,816 named no live process. The same periodic tick that
  retracts session-pid mappings now collects them, on the maintenance executor
  for the same `no-blocking-call-on-event-loop` reason (the directory is same-uid
  agent-writable). A record goes only when it is BOTH older than
  `_LEGACY_PID_BINDING_MIN_AGE_SECS` (24 h) AND its pid names no live process:
  age alone would race a record just written, and a dead-pid test alone would
  delete a record whose number has been recycled away from a still-running owner,
  so requiring both is what makes the prune safe against pid reuse in either
  direction. Symlinks are neither followed nor removed, unrecognised names are
  left alone (this sweep owns exactly the shape it can attribute to a pid), and
  each pass is capped at `_LEGACY_PID_BINDING_PRUNE_BUDGET` (2000) so a
  six-figure backlog drains over passes instead of monopolising one maintenance
  task.
- **Shell audit log cap** (`SessionCleanup._sweep_shell_audit_log` →
  `shell_audit_log.rotate_shell_audit_log`): the bundled `postToolUse` hook in
  `config/defaults.json` records every `execute_bash` call by appending a stamp
  line, the hook-event JSON kiro-cli hands it on stdin (the tool call — its
  command and, on this event, its result) and a blank line to
  `<data home>/audit.log`, and the command bounds nothing — measured at 4.4 MB
  over about five weeks on a default install, one file, no sibling generation.
  The bound is applied from the gateway side, not the hook: the shipped command
  stays byte-identical (no portable in-shell `stat` dance, no Python start per
  shell tool call through a helper the hook would have to find, no change for a
  user who authored their own hook), and the sweep reuses
  `jsonl_util.rotate_jsonl_at` — rename to ONE `.1` generation replacing any
  older one, a non-blocking try-lock so two rotators cannot both rotate, a
  rename rather than a truncate so the hook's `>>` keeps working and no record is
  cut mid-write, never raises. An over-cap file that stays over the cap after the
  attempt — the `.1` slot blocked by a planted directory, a sharing violation
  that never clears — is logged at WARNING, since the primitive
  swallows its own failure by contract and nothing else would tell a stuck bound
  from a file under the cap; the line is throttled to one per
  `shell_audit_log.SHELL_AUDIT_LOG_WARN_INTERVAL_SECS` (an hour) per data home,
  not one per attempt, because the tick retries for the gateway's whole life and
  a blocked slot does not clear itself, and it names the usual causes rather than
  a determined one (the primitive reports no reason, only that the file is still
  over the cap). The cap is `shell_audit_log.SHELL_AUDIT_LOG_MAX_BYTES`
  (8 MiB: about nine and a half weeks of the measured rate before the first
  rotation, roughly four months of history on disk with the kept generation).
  The steady-state bound on disk is that cap plus at most one tick interval of
  shell activity of overshoot on the live file, times two generations; the first
  rotation on an install that already carries an oversized file moves that whole
  file aside as `.1`, whatever its size, and the next rotation replaces it, so the
  bound holds from the second rotation on. This is the retention change the issue
  asked for: a default install's shell audit trail becomes finite — the live file
  plus one previous generation — where it was unbounded, and history older than
  the kept generation is discarded at each rotation. The step runs on every
  cleanup tick, under the same `MAX_TICK_INTERVAL_SECS` ceiling as the sweeps
  above, so an oversized file is bounded by the first tick after the loop starts;
  there is no separate start-of-loop pass, since one would gain at most one tick
  interval inside the overshoot the design already accepts. It runs on the
  maintenance executor for the same `no-blocking-call-on-event-loop` reason (the
  data home is same-uid agent-writable). A file under the cap costs one `stat`
  and creates nothing — the primitive's lock file appears only when a rotation
  is actually attempted — so a fresh data home gains no files from this sweep.
  The cleanup loop is not the file's only guardian: the hook runs inside
  kiro-cli whichever process launched it, and standalone `kirocrew chat` spawns
  the same agent with no cleanup loop, so `cli_chat._chat` runs the same sweep
  once at every chat start, before the backend is spawned (see
  [cli.md](cli.md), "Interactive Mode"); an install that never runs a gateway is
  bounded by its next chat start, overshooting by at most one session's shell
  activity. Not an LLM-facing capability: no MCP tool and no CLI command expose it.
- **Member execution routing**: the ordinary session/run owner record carries
  the immutable member/store snapshot. Strict MCP caller identity still uses
  the existing transport token and signed `session_pid` publication. No separate
  member PID publication, process ancestry scan, or member proof token exists.
  Providers receive the admitted privacy mode before startup; restricted workers
  do not retain Crew native-transcript copies or raw-frame logs. External engine
  retention follows that provider's own supported behavior.
- **Threat model** (full version in the `session_pid_sig.py` module
  docstring): file forgery, cross-pid replay, tampering, and symlink
  planting are blocked; deliberate same-uid impersonation via
  attacker-chosen env in self-launched processes is out of scope (identical
  capability exists against env-only resolution) and is tracked as the
  SO_PEERCRED gateway-authentication follow-up (issue #302).

### Stateless session-directive tools (`session_directive.py`, #755)

Codex MCP results wrap text in `rawOutput.result.content`; the ACP parser
extracts that text before directive decoding. Native MCP attribution remains on
the call. For out-of-band delivery, `event_input_digest` unwraps Codex's
`server/tool/arguments` only when it agrees with the independently identified
core tool. A trusted result whose marker is unavailable may claim that exact
session/turn/input-bound pending record. An unmatched final delivery surfaces a
NOT-applied notice; acknowledgement alone never confirms activation. The
subagent, caller, single-consumption and argument-matching fences still apply.


Eight session-bound MCP tools — `monitor_start`, `monitor_update`, `autonudge_stop`, `set_project`, `suggest_followup`, `ask_question`, `reset_conversation`, `chat_tag` — used to resolve their OWN session identity (the strict sidecar resolver above) and call a loopback HTTP endpoint, which only produced a usable per-call caller when MCP-gateway **pooling** was enabled. They are now **stateless**: the tool validates its arguments and returns a *directive* — a human-readable confirmation line plus a machine-readable marker (`session_directive.encode`) carrying the validated payload and NO session key. The session-aware consumer, `dashboard/chat_runner._run_chat`'s `EVENT_TOOL_RESULT` handler, decodes the marker (`session_directive.decode`) and applies the effect IN-PROCESS against ITS OWN `slot`/`session_key` via `dashboard/session_directive_apply.py`, then strips the marker from the stored transcript. This works with pooling OFF (the default) because the consumer already owns the session, so no per-process identity source is needed.

Subagent isolation is therefore **structural, not cryptographic**: a subagent's tool result flows through the subagent's own runner and can only ever bind to the subagent's session, never its parent's — there is no `/proc` walk to get wrong. The tools still call `_resolve_session_key_strict()`, but only as a context guard to short-circuit sessions where a directive can never be applied (cron/hook/subagent) and to steer non-`dashboard:` `ask_question` callers to the `[OPTIONS:]` tag — not to bind the effect.

Security properties (enforced in `session_directive.decode` plus the applier):

- **Forgery gate keyed on canonical identity**: because the marker is model-visible (it returns as the tool-result text), a directive is honoured ONLY when the tool call was recorded — via kiro-cli's out-of-band `_meta` channel — as an MCP call whose canonical `_meta.kiro.toolName` (with `_meta.kiro.mcpServerName` set) is in `DIRECTIVE_TOOLS`, never the LLM-authored `title`. A shell command titled `monitor_start` whose stdout forges the marker resolves to no directive tool and is ignored; the gate fails closed when `_meta` identity is absent.
- **Native sub-agent calls refused**: they surface as flat events in the parent loop but have no independently bindable slot, so the applier declines them.
- **SEL audit on every application**: `apply_session_directive` emits a tool-invocation event tagged `source="mcp-directive"` with outcome `success` / `denied` (e.g. a `set_project` sensitive-path block) / `error`, since the effect now runs in the consumer rather than in the tool body or an HTTP endpoint.

The applier reuses the SAME effect cores the HTTP endpoints call — `authorize_and_add_nudge` / `authorize_and_update_nudge` / `svc.remove` for the monitor trio, `slot.project` plus the recent-projects save for `set_project`, `deliver_ws_owners` for `suggest_followup`, and `post_question_card` for `ask_question` — so behavior is unchanged except that `ask_question` is now non-blocking (full contract in `learn-cron-dashboard.md` → "Agent Questions"). `reset_conversation` is the one directive whose core is not reachable inline: it queues `SessionManager.discard_conversation` on the slot for `chat_runner._consume_pending_reset` to apply at a turn boundary, because the discard is a full provider teardown and the producer is mid-turn — the same deferral `set_project` uses, and the reason the immediate route (`POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/reset-conversation`) answers 409 on a busy slot rather than tearing down a turn mid-write. It queues the session key THIS TURN ran on, passed in by the consumer, never re-resolved from the slot: `linked_session_key` is mutable, so a cron or workflow injection that rebinds the slot between the request and the consume would otherwise discard whatever the slot points at by then and leave the caller's conversation alone. Only the END-OF-TURN consume may apply a discard (`allow_discard`); the two earlier consume points run just before a turn acquires the session, where a teardown lands under a channel turn already streaming on it. Even at that boundary it does not assume: the discard goes through `discard_conversation(..., skip_if_busy=True)`, which refuses under the same session lock that pops the session, mirroring `reset`'s own guard. Probing from the consumer and tearing down afterwards would leave a window in which a channel message acquires the session's semaphore and begins streaming a reply the teardown then destroys — and the semaphore is the stricter signal anyway, since `provider.has_active_turn()` cannot see a turn holding the semaphore with no prompt in flight yet. A refusal returns False and changes nothing, replay flag and session map included, so the consumer leaves the flag armed for a later boundary. The sid clear runs in the SAME tick as the pop, with no await between them — deferring it past the shutdown awaits lets a concurrent channel turn map a SUCCESSOR session under the key while the old provider is still shutting down, and the clear then erases the successor's pointer instead of the discarded one. Sub-agent children are the other wait — `discard_conversation` releases the shared runtime they run on, so a running or queued child, or an in-flight completion-event delivery, also leaves the flag ARMED rather than killing the child's work. Both that consume and the route's 409 read one predicate, `chat_utils.subagents_attached_async`, so the two cannot drift. The queued flag is in-memory slot state: a gateway restart while it sits armed drops the reset the confirmation promised, which is accepted rather than persisted — the cost is one un-applied reset the caller can ask for again, against durable state for a transient intent. `set_project` and `reset_conversation` additionally require structural user-turn provenance: injected cron, task-runner, sub-agent, auto-nudge, orchestration, app-authenticated unattended turns, and app-authored Spec Builder seed/handoff prompts cannot retarget a borrowed destination slot even when its session key is user-facing. Spec Builder rejects app-token message and decision submissions before they can enter its human-provenance relay or durable decision ledger. Queue entries preserve this provenance, replacement text adopts the editor's provenance, and mixed or untagged merges fail closed.

Gateway-off (the default topology this targets), the model's tool result is the tool's OWN returned line delivered over kiro-cli's MCP pipe; the applier's confirmation string and SEL audit are recorded on KiroCrew's own surfaces (transcript / WS / hooks) and do NOT rewrite the model's tool result. Each tool therefore phrases its own message as a *request* that the consumer applies (and may refuse — no interactive session, invalid/sensitive path, capped/paused loop) rather than asserting the effect already landed.

### Orphan Sweep Active Set

The periodic sweep of `kiro_session_pids.txt` (which kills tracked kiro-cli
PIDs no longer in `self._sessions`) builds its active set as the union of
`_collect_active_pids(self._sessions)` + `_pool_pids()` + `_in_flight_pids()`
+ `_companion_runtime_pids()`, re-checked against the same union in phase 2
before any kill. `_companion_runtime_pids()` returns the live PIDs of
`self._subagent_runtimes` (companion runtimes multiplexing a parent session's
subagents) and `self._bg_runtime` (the multiplexed `_bg` runtime), each guarded
on `is_alive()` — only alive runtimes are shielded, so dead ones are still
reaped.

**Failure it fixes**: since the `AcpRuntime` unify, *every* runtime records its
PID in `kiro_session_pids.txt` at spawn. These two runtime kinds live outside
`self._sessions`, so before this union the sweep saw their live PIDs as
untracked orphans and SIGKILLed them mid-chat (surfacing as
`process exited (rc=-9)`).

### Cross-platform process management (platform_compat)

### Reclaim identity: a projected marker set, and a subtractive token

`kiro_session_pids.txt` entries are swept by `_sweep_pid_entries` (periodic, in two
phases) and `cleanup_orphaned_session_roots` (startup). What authorizes a signal in
both is `_is_managed_agent_process(pid)` — does this PID still name the kind of process
the entry described — plus each arm's own condition: a dead owning gateway, and for a
token-less entry a reparent to init or to the dead gateway.

That gate is per-TOKEN and exact wherever a command line can be read (Linux `/proc`,
macOS `ps`), never a substring of the whole line: the projected names include
three-character ones, and `dsh` sits inside `friendship`, `goose` inside `mongoose`. The
tokens allowed to answer are chosen by POSITION: `argv[0]`, and — only when `argv[0]`'s
basename is `node`, `nodejs` or `node.exe` — `argv[1]`, which is the script slot of a
Node-hosted adapter.

`argv[1]` exactly, never "the first token that does not look like a flag". Crew launches an
adapter as `[node, <script>]` and passes no interpreter options, so the script is always at
index 1 — while scanning past options hands an option VALUE to the name test. `--require`
and its kin take one, so `node app.js --require /any/path` would offer `/any/path` as the
script slot, and a path an unrelated process merely MENTIONS would authorize a SIGKILL of
it. Distinguishing a value-taking Node option from a boolean one needs a table of Node's
flags, which is an open set and a moving one; index 1 is neither. A leading `-` at index 1
opens no slot, because Crew never emits one. Node spellings only: every registered backend's bespoke adapter is a
Node entry script, and each name in that set widens the slot in which a harness name is
accepted, so one added for an interpreter nothing launches under is authority granted for
a shape that does not exist. An adapter shipping as a Python entry script adds its
interpreter there with its own review. The rest of argv is excluded because arguments are
chosen by whoever started the process and say nothing about what it is; accepting them let
`node build.js --agent goose` authorize a SIGKILL.

Both positions are taken on the WRAPPED argv when the command line is Crew's own Linux
sandbox launcher. Where the namespace backend is in use — `sandbox.detect_backend() ==
"namespace"`, which is what the shipped `auto` resolves to on any Linux host whose kernel
permits an unprivileged user namespace (stock Ubuntu 23.10+ is the notable exception; see
[security](security.md) on `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns`) — the pid the
gateway tracks is not the harness at all. `sandbox.namespace_argv` wraps the spawn as
`<interpreter> -I -S <run dir>/kirocrew_sandbox_<pid>_<rand>.py <harness argv…>`, and the
launcher's PARENT never execs: it writes the child's uid/gid maps and then blocks in
`waitpid` for the life of the session (`sandbox_launcher.main`). So the gate's `argv[0]`
is the interpreter and the harness sits past the script, where the two positional rules
above were not looking, and every sandboxed agent root answered "not managed". The cost
was not a spared process: the settled-token arm RETAINS an entry the argv gate does not
recognise — never killed, never pruned, because dropping the record would make the process
unfindable by every sweep — and the scope reaper skips its scope too, since gate (i) of
[§Reaping abandoned agent scopes](#reaping-abandoned-agent-scopes) refuses any scope holding
a tracked pid. So an unrecognised root holds its whole `kiro-cli` runtime, several hundred
MB, for as long as the OWNING GATEWAY lives. `cleanup_orphaned_session_roots` applies the
same gate, so a restart does not clear it either; what ends it is the launcher REPARENTING
when its gateway dies, which moves it into the orphan-MCP sweep's population. Recognition,
not disposal, is therefore what had to change.

`_sandbox_launcher_wrapped_argv` names that ONE shape positively, and the conjunction is
what keeps an ordinary Python process off a kill path: `argv[0]`'s basename is a CPython
spelling, the launcher's interpreter flags occupy the next positions exactly and in order,
that token's basename carries both the prefix and the suffix `sandbox.py` generates its
launcher tempfile with, its DIRECTORY is `sandbox.namespace_launcher_script_dir()`, and at
least one token follows. A plain `python foo.py kiro-cli` fails three of the five. The
suffix is carried because the `.sb` seatbelt profile is written beside the launcher under
the same prefix.

The directory comparison is EXACT and lexical in both directions, and the normalization
that makes that sound happens on the WRITER's side:
`sandbox.namespace_launcher_script_dir()` returns `normpath(abspath(<config_dir>/run))`
and `namespace_argv` hands that same value to `mkstemp`, so a data home spelled with `..`
or a trailing separator is already collapsed by the time the path reaches `/proc`.
Normalizing the token instead would widen what a kill path accepts — to `run/../run` and
to a relative spelling resolved against the SWEEPING gateway's cwd, which is a path the
target process never named. The directory is `os.fsencode`d, not `str.encode`d, so a data
home that is not valid UTF-8 still matches the bytes `/proc` holds.

ONLY the preferred run directory is accepted. `_ensure_run_dir` degrades to the system
tmpdir when the crew `run/` cannot be created or chmod'd, and that directory is shared with
every other user of the host: accepting it on a kill path would let a path anyone can write
decide which process trees are reclaimable. RESIDUAL, stated rather than closed: on such a
host a sandboxed root is not recognised and its entry is retained, exactly as before this
gate learned the shape. Closing it needs identity a shared path cannot supply.

Every one of those values is read from the `sandbox` module rather than spelled again:
`_LAUNCHER_INTERPRETER_FLAGS`, `_SANDBOX_ARTIFACT_PREFIX` and `_LAUNCHER_SCRIPT_SUFFIX`
through `session_pid._namespace_launcher_shape` (which reads them off the module object at
call time, so a test can repoint any of them), and the directory through
`sandbox.namespace_launcher_script_dir()`. `clone_setup._LAUNCHER_TRACEBACK_RE` reads the
same two name constants, and both `mkstemp` calls in `sandbox.py` now take their prefix and
suffix from them too — so adding a launcher flag, moving the run directory or renaming the
artifact moves the recogniser's idea of the script slot with the builder's instead of
silently handing it a flag token. Pinned end to end against a real `namespace_argv` result.

The directory is the one part that is a FUNCTION rather than a constant, and the gate asks
for it LAST, because `namespace_launcher_script_dir()` resolves `config_dir()`, which
creates the data home and can raise, and the gate runs once per tracked entry on every
sweep — so an ordinary unwrapped `kiro-cli` argv answers without reaching it at all. And
the gate NEVER raises: an unreadable shape returns "not the launcher", which costs one
missed reclaim, where propagating would abort the sweep for every remaining entry
(`cleanup_orphaned_session_roots`'s caller swallows the error with no per-entry guard, so
one unreadable home would silently stop reclaiming anything).

Exactly one unwrap, and the reason is the OS, not a convention: the launcher's own
seccomp-BPF filter denies `unshare` (with `mount`, `umount2`, `setns`, `pivot_root`) for
everything in the sandboxed tree, and refuses the spawn outright where that filter cannot
be installed, so a second launcher inside the first cannot reach a namespace at all. An
in-sandbox `wrap_argv` detecting the marker and passing through is the layer above that.
Accepting the nested shape would be authority granted for one the OS already makes
impossible. The inner positional rules are unchanged,
so a wrapped `/usr/bin/make` or a wrapped editor opened on a file called `kiro-cli` still
answers "not a harness" — the sandbox wraps MCP probes and app backends too, and the
launcher being Crew's proves only that Crew started the process, not that it is an agent
runtime.

`_is_untracked_managed_agent_orphan` deliberately does NOT use this gate, and keeps its
own argv0 test. It answers a different question — "is this a runtime no reaper can reach"
— and an orphaned launcher IS reached: its command line carries the sandbox artifact
prefix, so `_is_orphan_mcp` accepts it and the orphan-MCP sweep kills it on the same pass.
Teaching it the launcher shape would make that arm log "leaked agent runtime, not
terminated" about a pid that is already a kill candidate and inflate `leaked_untracked`
with it. The asymmetry is pinned by a test, so it is not quietly "fixed" later.

RESIDUAL — the zombie launcher. `_kill_pid_tree` signals the children and then re-checks
the root. A launcher that has already reaped its child and exited is a zombie whose
`/proc/<pid>/cmdline` is EMPTY, so the gate declines and the root kill is skipped for that
pass; the settled-token arm retains the entry (the pid still probes alive), the next pass
finds it DEAD and prunes it. One extra pass, not a lost process — and retaining rather than
pruning on an empty cmdline is what makes it self-healing.

Nothing equivalent is needed on macOS. The seatbelt wrap is `env … /usr/bin/sandbox-exec
-f <profile> <argv…>`, and both of those exec through, so the tracked pid ends up carrying
the harness's own argv.

The script slot accepts two spellings, because the resolver produces two, and they are
matched by two different KINDS of identity. The bin shim is `node /opt/n/bin/codex-acp`,
where the basename IS the name, matched exactly. The package entry is
`node <pkg>/dist/index.js`, where the basename is `index.js` and names nothing — so that
one is matched against the RESOLVED RELATIVE PATH, one of
`backends.node_adapter_entry_relpaths()`, segment for segment against the token's tail.
The install root above the package is free, because the resolver walks several roots; from
the package name down it is exact.

Matching a NAME found along the path is what this replaces, and the difference is which
axis stays open. A package directory's name is chosen by whoever installed it, so reading
the harness names out of it leaves "what a process may call itself" unbounded — and the
harness set includes single-binary harnesses Crew never hands to Node at all (`goose` runs
as `goose acp`, likewise `opencode` and `dsh`). A real unrelated npm application at
`node /srv/goose/dist/index.js` therefore answered for a harness and would be SIGKILLed by
the periodic reclaim. The three launch paths are a closed set this repository publishes, so
comparing them closes the axis instead of narrowing it: `ACP_BACKEND_NODE_ADAPTER_PACKAGES`
in `agent_sdk.backends` is the one table, the resolvers build their entry paths from it, and
the reclaim reads the same list — so a path the resolver can produce and the reclaim cannot
recognise, or a path the reclaim accepts and Crew never spawns, are both a failing test
rather than a leaked process or a wrong kill.

`_MANAGED_AGENT_MARKERS` is PROJECTED from the backend registry
(`agent_sdk.backends.agent_process_markers`), not written by hand. A hand-written
`("kiro-cli", "claude")` pair answered for two of the eight harnesses Crew spawns, so
a dead gateway's `codex-acp`, `opencode`, `pi-acp`, `goose` or `dsh` orphan answered
"not ours" — and the branch for an unrecognised PID both spares the process and drops
its tracking entry, the one file every sweep mechanism keys off to find it. Spared and
forgotten. A harness added later is one row in `ACP_BACKEND_PROCESS_NAMES`, and a
ratchet in `test_pid_lifecycle` fails when a registered backend has no row. The three
self-served harnesses read their own `ACP_BACKEND_LAUNCH` row so the two cannot
disagree, and the three bespoke adapters' own `*_ACP_BIN` constants (plus
`KIRO_CLI_BIN`) INDEX the table rather than repeating it — `acp.client` may read
`agent_sdk.backends`, a stdlib-only leaf, even though `session_pid` may not read the
ACP layer, so the one-way dependency removes the duplicate spelling instead of only
policing it. A test asserts the equality, so a literal reintroduced in either place is
caught there rather than by a sweep failing to recognise the process the adapter spawns.

The recorded start token is SUBTRACTIVE EVIDENCE ONLY, the same rule `kiro_pids.txt`
follows. A live value that differs from the recorded one proves the PID was recycled
and prunes the entry without a signal; an unreadable live value is "unknown" and
retains the entry for the next pass; a value that MATCHES authorizes nothing, because
the tracking file is same-uid-writable and the token is readable from `/proc` for any
introspectable PID, so the file's contents may not confer a capability. A settled
token does remove the weaker PPid recycle test in the startup arm, which predates this
and is load-bearing: an orphan does not always reparent to init, since a child placed
in its own cgroup scope reparents to that user manager, a subreaper.

Because the token grants nothing, its Linux boot-relativity costs a missed prune
rather than a wrong kill. `platform_compat._own_identity_token` is the reboot-unique
form should a future change need one.

The periodic sweep's two phases do not pass a verdict between them. The kill phase
re-reads the entry and re-applies the subtractive check, since an event-loop hop
separates the phases and a PID can be reallocated across it. A candidate whose entry is
absent from that re-read is SKIPPED, not killed: nothing in the file then records what
the PID was, so the recycle guard has no input, and an absent entry is also one this
pass owes no write-back. The unreadable-file arm returns an empty index, which makes a
transient read failure cost zero kills for one pass rather than un-vouched kills for
every candidate. The phase also prunes by the entry's own TEXT: a rebuilt `<gw>:<pid>`
string never matches a token-bearing line, so a reaped process's entry survived in the
file and every later pass met a dead PID there.

RESIDUAL — Windows. Only an image name is readable cheaply there (a real command line
means a WMI query per PID, and these sweeps ask for every tracked entry), so an
interpreter-hosted adapter reads as `node.exe` whatever names the set holds, and its
orphans are not reclaimed by name on that platform. The image name is still compared
EXACTLY against the same basename set, so the gap can only ever spare a process, never kill
an unrelated one. Closing it needs a per-PID identity Windows can read cheaply, which is
its own change; it is stated here rather than narrowed, because a better name match cannot
reach it. The basename split handles `\` as well as `/` regardless, so a Windows-shaped
argv0 in a command line that DOES get read is not carried whole into an exact-name test.

Windows synchronous provider fallback, including `_proc` and `_active_proc`
shapes, uses the same exact-tree cleanup admission as ACP teardown. Capacity
refusal preserves the root/tracking and never falls back to root-only signalling.
`retire_windows_tree_tracking` checks both PID-file writers and removes the
protected-PID shield only while the cleanup owner still pins the incarnation.
A failed writer retains the receipt and its reservation for maintenance. Numeric
root absence does not retire a pending tree's session record. Manual overflow
is permanent for this gateway process; see the cleanup bounds and recovery
procedure in [platform-compat](../common/platform-compat.md#windows-session-tree-teardown).

All process liveness/kill/PID-file-lock operations in `session.py` and
`session_pid.py` go through `kiro_crew.platform_compat` so KiroCrew runs natively on
Windows as well as macOS/Linux. The critical correctness reason is that
**`os.kill(pid, 0)` is NOT a liveness probe on Windows — it terminates the process** —
so every liveness check uses `platform_compat.pid_exists(pid)` (or the tri-state
`pid_liveness`) instead, kills use `kill_pid` / `kill_process_tree`, the PID-reuse
guard reads the parent via `get_ppid`, the managed-agent check authorizes on argv
for every entry (`process_matches(pid, _MANAGED_AGENT_MARKERS)`, with the recorded
`get_process_start_id` token as subtractive evidence only — see "Reclaim identity"
above), and the PID-file locks use
`platform_compat.file_lock` / `acquire_lock` / `try_acquire_lock` (POSIX `flock`
vs Windows `msvcrt`). On POSIX the behavior is unchanged.

## Bytecode-Cache GC (periodic sweep hook)

The desktop app launches the gateway with `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX` pointed at
`<data home>/cache/pycache` (keeps the embedded interpreter's bytecode out of
the codesigned bundle). CPython only ever adds to that PEP 3147 mirror, so the
periodic sweep in `_cleanup_loop()` owns eviction: it calls
`pycache_gc.prune_pycache` (mtime TTL + oldest-first total-size cap; limits
owned by `pycache_gc.py`) on the maintenance executor, gated to at most once
per `PYCACHE_GC_INTERVAL_SECS` because the prune walks the whole cache tree —
far heavier than the sweep's ~5-minute tick. `_last_pycache_gc` starts `None`
so the first tick after the first session starts prunes pre-existing bloat
(`_cleanup_loop()` is launched by session registration, not gateway start),
and is stamped **before** the prune runs so a failing walk retries at GC
cadence, not every tick. The traversal is anchored to no-follow directory
handles (`O_NOFOLLOW | O_DIRECTORY` + `dir_fd`-relative unlink/rmdir), and
the root is opened component by component from the filesystem root, so a
symlink or junction substituted anywhere — under the cache root mid-walk, or
swapped into a writable ancestor such as `cache/` itself — fails the open
instead of redirecting deletion outside the cache (a legitimately symlinked
ancestor thus makes the prune a conservative no-op); on platforms without
`dir_fd` support (Windows) the prune is a fail-closed no-op. Deleting entries
is always safe: a `.pyc` regenerates on the next
import. The unbounded-growth *input* (foreign interpreters in the agent
subtree inheriting the prefix) is closed separately by the sandbox env scrub —
see [security](security.md) § Conditional Python-interpreter env strip.

## Recovery ladder (`recovery/policy.py`, `recovery/ladder.py`)

Every layer that retries reads ONE schedule. `RecoveryPolicy` is exponential
backoff (`base * 2**(attempt-1)`, base `agent.recovery_backoff_base_secs`=2s,
cap `agent.recovery_backoff_max_secs`=120s) with EQUAL jitter (a delay is drawn
from `[raw/2, raw]` -- full jitter can draw a near-zero delay and hot-loop a
layer whose failure is not transient yet); a server-stated `retry_after` is a
floor, never ignored, and still capped so a hostile hint cannot park a task.
Attempts are counted per unit (`RecoveryTracker`: a slot key, a backend key, a
runtime id, the daemon) and forgotten after a cooldown, so a unit that failed a
day ago starts at attempt 1. The ladder is tried bottom-up and each rung is
bounded; escalation happens only when the rung below exhausted its attempts:

| layer | unit | trigger | cleanup deadline | attempts before escalation | action |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `L1_tool_call` | slot | JSON-RPC error classed `recoverable_infra`: the MCP stub's `-32001 capacity` (with `retry_after_secs`), backend gone, spawn-queue timeout | -- | 3 | re-issue the call: one continuation on the same session (`chat_runner`, below); task stays running |
| `L2_backend` | backend key | `BackendGone`, initialize timeout, breaker OPEN | per-backend shutdown budget (`POOL_SHUTDOWN_SECS`) | 2 | `daemon/replacement.py::_respawn_backend_for_stub` under the spawn gate |
| `L3_acp_runtime` | runtime | `AcpRuntimeDead`, stall past the idle window, `session/new` abandoned | `TOTAL_SHUTDOWN_BUDGET_SECS` + process-tree kill | 2 | rebuild the runtime, `session/load` if continuable; task `recovering` |
| `L4_gatewayd` | daemon | liveness ping failed 3x (neither the fast nor the escalated probe answered) AND no backend progress | daemon drain | one respawn per 600s window (the second escalates) | `GatewayManager._run_watchdog` respawn; stubs reconnect within their 600s budget |
| `L5_gateway` | gateway | none automatic | -- | 0 | ONE notification per escalation; the user restarts. Never a `kirocrew restart`. |

**Where the rungs are recorded.** L1 for the main chat is `chat_runner`'s infra branch (below); for a sub-agent it is `subagent_manager/run.py::_yield_for_infra_retry`, which takes the ladder's delay and parks the run on the dependency coordinator's `mcp_gateway:<class>` scope ([subagent.md](subagent.md)). L2 is `daemon/replacement.py::_respawn_backend_for_stub`: a completed respawn is `record_restart(L2_backend)` + `observe_success(L2, server)`, a give-up is `observe_failure(L2, server)` (the breaker's OPEN cooldown is the wait between rungs; the ladder counts, it does not sleep there). L3 is counted by the sub-agent run when the parent's shared runtime is unavailable (`observe_failure(L3, runtime:<parent>)`; the dedicated process stays the per-run recovery, the runtime's rebuild belongs to its owning session). L4 is the gatewayd supervisor. Distinct from these per-rung attempt counts is `SESSION_RECOVERY_MAX_ATTEMPTS` (3), the IN-PLACE budget for continuing one ACP session on the same runtime — the main chat's tool-stall / stale_recover nudges and pipe-death re-queues and the sub-agent's stop recovery all read it (`acp.types.STOP_RECOVERY_MAX_RETRIES` is its re-export).

Overload never enters the ladder: pressure lowers caps and pauses admission
([adaptive-concurrency](adaptive-concurrency.md)); only a unit that stopped
making progress AND failed an independent probe is torn down. L4 is `pinned`:
its floor/cap (1s/60s) are what the stub's 600s reconnect budget is sized
from, so the `agent.recovery_*` knobs move every layer but that one.

**Where the configured schedule is installed.** `RecoveryPolicy` imports no
config (the MCP stub depends on it), so the two keys are pushed in from outside:
`GatewayOrchestrator._init_subagents` calls `recovery.ladder.configure_default_ladder(cfg)`
once, on the config the process already holds, and every `default_ladder()`
consumer — the chat runner's L1 branch, the runner adapter's `decide_recovery`,
`task_executor`'s L3 backoff, `kirocrew doctor`'s ladder rows — then reads that
one snapshot. That step, not the module table, is what a configured install runs;
the table is the default. It sits in `_init_subagents` because that boot step is
unconditional and precedes the task runner, the dashboard and any chat slot, i.e.
every consumer above. The snapshot is one-shot, matching the keys' `restart=True`:
a later call keeps the first schedule and the attempt counts recorded under it, so
a knob change takes effect on the next start, and a ladder an earlier
`default_ladder()` already built adopts the configured schedule rather than
depending on boot order. L4 is skipped, being `pinned`. Two waits outside the
ladder reach the same two keys the same way, from a config already in hand: a
dependency wait through `taskq.dependency.coordinator_from_config` and a failed
store re-open through `taskq_bridge.taskq_arm_reopen(cfg)`. That is why
`kirocrew doctor` prints one number for the knob and not two.

The layers read the schedule instead of holding literals:
`mcp_gateway/manager.py::_RESPAWN_BACKOFF_START_SECS/_MAX_SECS` are
`LADDER.layer(L4).base_secs/max_secs` — the pinned rung, so import time is the
right time to read it — and every doubling goes through
`GatewayManager._next_respawn_backoff` (doubled, capped, jittered). Two sites read
the STATIC defaults at import and therefore do NOT follow the knobs:
`acp/client.py::_ACP_RESPAWN_BACKOFF_S` is L3's default base, spent on the single
permitted respawn delay, and `taskq/model.py`'s `recovery_backoff_secs` is the bare
default schedule (deterministic -- the dispatcher jitters when it wakes a row, and
the store orders rows by `next_run_at`, which wants a pure function).
`RecoveryLadder` emits
`kirocrew.recovery.{attempts,escalations,duration_secs,restarts}` and, given a
task id, one `task_events(kind="recover")` row per decision.

**L1 in the chat runner.** `AcpSessionHandle` classifies every tool result
once, at the protocol layer (`classify_infra_error` -> `handle.last_infra_error`,
cleared at turn start): the stub's `-32001` error object or its serialised
text, `class=capacity` + `retry_after_secs`, and a closed set of gateway
`recoverable_infra` markers; a result longer than 2000 chars is a document,
not an error, and never matches. The verdict describes the LAST tool result, so
dispatching a new tool call clears it: an output-less completion emits no
`EVENT_TOOL_RESULT` at all, and without that clear the consumer would re-issue a
refusal an intervening call had already superseded. It reaches the consumer
through the provider chain, the same three-level shape as
`last_compaction_transient` and never a cached copy: a read-only pass-through
property on `AcpSessionProvider` (from `_handle`) and on `AcpProvider` (from
`_client`), over `LLMProvider`'s `None` default for a provider that does not
classify tool results. Read-only because the handle is the sole writer -- a
caller that could set a verdict could force a tool re-issue.

At end of turn, when the turn ended normally and the LAST tool result was such
an error, `chat_runner` asks the ladder; on
`retry` it shows a notice, waits the jittered delay (`_recovery_delay`, a
module seam), RE-READS the interrupt signals, and only then queues ONE
continuation (`build_infra_retry_prompt`, opening
with `REFUSAL_RECOVERY_PREFIX` -- a capacity refusal is a tool refusal carried
back to the model) that asks for the same call again -- never a verbatim
replay of the user's message, because earlier calls this turn may have taken
effect. The re-read is the throttle-exhaustion fallback's shape and exists for
its reason: the guards in the branch condition were read before a multi-second
wait, and a Stop, a steer or a user follow-up arriving during it resolves while
no prompt is active, so nothing downstream catches it -- the dispatch-point
purge covers the promise-only and post-compaction continuations only. It reads
the LIVE signals (`_should_suppress_requeue`, `_stop_pressed()`, a queued user
follow-up, `_pending_steers`), so it also sees a stop issued on a linked channel
surface, which the slot-scoped generation in the condition cannot. On an
interrupt the re-queue is dropped, the ladder attempt is handed back with
`forget` (a run charged for a retry that never ran shortens the next real ladder),
the slot's own `_infra_retries` bump is given back for symmetry with the one line
that made it -- the landing's settlement clears it either way -- the persisted
"retrying it in Ns" card is
corrected in one line on the dispatch-point purge's trigger split (only a user's
own message takes over; a Stop ran nothing), and the turn LANDS:
`_recovering_infra` stays clear so it settles, saves and resets its budgets like
any other landing. A turn that DID re-queue the continuation is un-landed
(`_recovering_infra`, like `_recovering_promise`).
The wait is counted on the slot's OWN `_infra_retries` (health cause
`infra_capacity`), never on `_transient_5xx_retries`: that one is a live budget
read by the re-prompt gate, the backoff seed and the throttle-exhaustion
model-fallback threshold, so spending it here shortens the next real 5xx ladder,
inflates its backoff seed and brings the swap onto `agent.fallback_model` that
many errors closer -- over a wait the model had no part in. Like the transient
budget it is cleared on a landed turn AND on every arm that ends the turn without
re-queuing.

On `escalate` the runner stops retrying and says so, and marks the run spent
(`_l1_escalated`) -- distinct from `_recovering_infra`, which also suppresses
turn settlement and consolidation, because an escalated turn does land. A landed
turn that RECOVERED calls `observe_success(L1, slot.key)`, which measures the
outage; a landed turn after `escalate`, or after an interrupt during the backoff
dropped the re-queue (`_l1_interrupted`), calls `forget(L1, slot.key)` instead,
so the next user turn gets a fresh budget and no recovery duration is recorded
for an outage that never closed -- an interrupted run never ran its retry, so
nothing observed the dependency come back.

**Every recovery wait in `_run_chat` re-reads its interrupt signals after the
sleep, and WHAT it re-reads depends on what it re-queues.** All three waits on the
exception/settlement path check their guards, sleep a multi-second floor, then
insert at queue index 0. A Stop, steer or follow-up arriving during that sleep
resolves while no prompt is active, and the dispatch-point purge in
`_start_next_queued_turn` covers only the promise-only and post-compaction
continuations -- so each arm re-reads for itself.

| Wait | Re-reads | Handed back on a drop |
|---|---|---|
| L1 gateway-capacity (CONTINUATION) | suppress, `_stop_pressed()`, queued user follow-up, `_pending_steers` | the counted `_infra_retries`; the ladder run is `forget`-ed, not recorded as recovered |
| same-model transient 5xx (VERBATIM REPLAY) | suppress, `_stop_pressed()` **only** | all four per-turn budgets (`_transient_5xx_retries`, `_infra_retries`, `_fallback_candidate_idx`, `_fallback_walked`), byte-identical to the throttle-exhaustion drop arm |
| post-token one-shot (CONTINUATION) | suppress, `_stop_pressed()`, queued user follow-up, `_pending_steers` | nothing: `_posttoken_retry_used` is consumed BELOW the wait, so a dropped retry never spends the allowance |

The replay arm's two exclusions are deliberate, not an omission. It runs on
`not _turn_emitted`: no token and no tool call landed, so a mid-turn correction has
nothing to contradict and the user's request is still entirely un-run -- dropping it
would erase that request with no output anywhere in the transcript. Ordering keeps
both intents instead: the replay goes in at the HEAD, so a follow-up typed during
the backoff runs after it, and an unconsumed steer is degraded to a head card by
`_requeue_unconsumed_steers` in the same `finally`, which dequeues BEFORE the
replay. The throttle-exhaustion arm, which replays the identical message, reads the
identical two signals. Three blocks and not one helper, for that reason: a helper
checking the union would force the replay arm to drop on a follow-up, which is the
wrong answer there.

Every drop APPENDS a correction rather than retracting the pending card. The
pre-wait row carries `TRANSIENT_NOTICE_RETRYING` / `_RESUMING`, which the dashboard
renders as "retrying..." indefinitely; the drop appends `TRANSIENT_GIVE_UP_TEXT`
with `TRANSIENT_NOTICE_GIVE_UP` so the ErrorCard's Continue affordance comes back.
The post-token arm's persisted partial is never retracted (append-only).
`_recovery_delay` is the module seam these waits sleep through, so a pin can deliver
an interrupt DURING the wait without a process-wide `asyncio.sleep` patch; the
throttle-exhaustion arm still calls `asyncio.sleep` directly, and needs no seam
because it already re-read after its wait.

## Structured session health (`dashboard/session_health.py`)

`GET /api/sessions/health` classifies every running slot from STRUCTURED state,
in this order of authority: task rows (`taskq.TaskStore`), slot state
(`_ChatSlot.running`, open `_approval_futures`, `_question_pending`,
`_wait_state`, the recovery retry counters, children running for the slot), and
ACP handle liveness (`awaiting_permission`, the in-flight tool and its dispatch
age, `parked_for_secs`, the `_ingress_seq` / text-chunk / transcript progress
markers). Each slot is exactly one of `running`, `queued`, `waiting_children`,
`waiting_permission`, `waiting_dependency`, `waiting_input`, `recovering`,
`stalled`, with evidence and age. Only `stalled` is a defect: a slot whose
progress markers have not moved for `STALL_AFTER_SECS` (600s) with no wait
reason and no liveness-oracle `WORKING` verdict. A permission wait is never a
stall however old; a queued task is queue wait, not execution; a long tool call
that keeps producing events is running. The snapshot (`snapshot_state`) is
taken on the loop because it walks live objects; the classification
(`SessionHealthMonitor.compute`), the store read and the log tail run off it.
The `gateway.log` regex scan (`scan_log_for_stalls`) is a SECONDARY source: it
adds evidence to a running slot and is the sole source only when no state
objects are reachable; it never overrides a structured wait.

Payload: `{generated_at, stalled{slot: {reason, since_ts, evidence, age_secs}},
slots{slot: {classification, evidence, age_secs, since_ts, source}},
waiting[{kind: slot|task, ..., reason}], recovering[...], queued{available,
count, oldest_wait_secs, by_state}, effective_caps{lane_kind: {effective, ...}},
degrade_reason, counts{running, queued, waiting, recovering, stalled},
stall_after_secs, sources{slots, taskq, log}}`. `queued.count` sums
`session_health.TASK_QUEUED_STATES` — the states with nothing executing under
them that a dispatcher picks up on its own, `waiting_infra` included, since
infra capacity is exactly what that row waits for. `/api/tasks/summary`'s
`depth.queued` reads THAT constant rather than a second list, so the two panels
answer one number (`test_api_tasks.py::test_queued_set_is_one_constant_spelled_from_the_model`,
`::test_waiting_infra_is_queued_on_both_surfaces`). The task rows reported under
`waiting` are `taskq.model.WAITING` and nothing else: a live run yielded its
lane slot and its runtime is still resident. `effective_caps` and
`degrade_reason` come from sources the adaptive controller registers
(`default_monitor().register_cap_source(lane_kind, fn)` /
`register_pressure_source(fn)`); `subagents` is read from the manager directly.
Each computation samples `kirocrew.taskq.depth{state}`,
`kirocrew.taskq.oldest_wait_secs`, `kirocrew.taskq.effective_cap{lane_kind}` and
`kirocrew.taskq.pressure_reason{reason}` -- every attribute a closed-set value.

**Refresh signal.** The verdict is not only computed on request. Every
computation goes through `handlers/sessions.py::refresh_session_health` (the
one owner of the payload cache and of the signal), which digests the verdict
with `health_verdict_fingerprint` and, when the digest differs from the one last
signalled, broadcasts the WS frame `session_health_changed` with the payload
`{"ts": <wall clock>}` and nothing else -- no slot, no session key, no count, no
classification. The frame says only THAT the verdict moved; a subscriber
entitled to `GET /api/sessions/health` re-reads it, and a frontend-only app whose
manifest does not list that path refreshes the surfaces it can already read
instead of polling an endpoint that answers it with a denial. The digest
excludes every age, timestamp and monotonic reading (a quiet resample is not a
change) and folds everything else in BY IDENTITY, never only by count: each
slot's classification and `native_children`, which slots are stalled, each
waiting and recovering row's identity and state, the queue's `by_state`
tallies, `effective_caps`, the `uncharged` per-kind tally and
`degrade_reason` -- so one row leaving a state as another enters it is a change
even though every count stands still. The first computation after process start
seeds the baseline silently rather than firing a refresh at every subscriber on
every gateway restart; a broadcast that fails leaves the digest uncommitted so
the change is retried on the next computation. The frame rides the pre-existing
`sessions` event declaration in `ws_event_scope._GLOBAL_EVENT_DECLARATIONS`
(`events` and `api` are independent manifest fields, which is why the frame must
stay data-free), and delivery is judged per frame by `ws_event_allowed` against
the live scope. Because the verdict also moves with the clock (a turn crossing
the stall threshold, a queue draining, a cap being cut), a WebSocket connection
whose declaration set includes `sessions` runs a per-connection timer driver
(`ws.py::_refresh_health_loop`) that calls `refresh_session_health` at connect
and then every `_HEALTH_REFRESH_SECS` -- the handler's own cache TTL, so the call
is TTL-gated and single-flighted and every declaring socket together costs at
most one computation per interval. The first tick is at connect rather than
after one interval because the first computation in a process is the silent
baseline: a driver that slept first would let a verdict that moved during that
sleep become the baseline and never signal it. A connection that declared
nothing, or something unrelated, runs no driver, and a dashboard user (not
declaration-gated, reads the endpoint directly) drives nothing either. The app SDK's event-declaration map
(`website/src/app-sdk/index.ts`) lists `session_health_changed` under `sessions`
so an app author sees which declaration the frame rides. Tests:
`test/test_session_health_signal.py`.

Tests: `test/test_session_health.py`, `test/test_sessions_health_cache.py`,
`test/test_recovery_policy.py`, `test/test_recovery_ladder.py`,
`test/test_recovery_l1_chat_runner.py`.

## Resource Budget (Gateway Mode)

| Session | Key Pattern | Lifetime | Process |
|---------|-------------|----------|---------|
| User chat | `slack:{thread_ts}` (legacy bare `{thread_ts}` folded) | Idle timeout (60 min) | Own kiro-cli |
| Dashboard tab | `dashboard:{slot_key}` | Idle timeout (60 min) | Own kiro-cli (from warm pool) |
| Cron job | `cron:{job_id}` | One-shot (reset after) | Own kiro-cli (from warm pool) |
| Background | `_bg` | Entire runtime (recycled at 70%) | Shared kiro-cli |
| Heartbeat | `_bg` | Shared | Shared kiro-cli |
| Lesson extract | `_bg` | Shared | Shared kiro-cli |
| Subagent | `subagent:{uuid}` | Task duration | Own kiro-cli |
| TaskRunner step | `taskrunner:{task_id}:step{N}` | Step duration (reset after) | Own kiro-cli (max 2 concurrent via semaphore) |
| TaskRunner decompose | `taskrunner:{task_id}:decompose` | Seconds | Own kiro-cli |
| TaskRunner review | `taskrunner:{task_id}:review` | Seconds | Own kiro-cli |
| TaskRunner acceptance | `taskrunner:{task_id}:acceptance` | Seconds | Own kiro-cli |
| Warm spare | _(in pool queue)_ | Until assigned | Pre-started kiro-cli |

**Cold-start admission**: `SessionManager._start_sem` bounds provider starts local
to one manager. The narrower common runtime chokepoint adds a gateway-wide
`AcpRuntime.spawn()` coordinator capped at 2 concurrent spawn + `initialize`
handshakes, matching worker-pool `max_starting=min(workers, 2)`. Authoring,
interactive, background, shared-runtime, and unpooled callers therefore share the
same expensive-start bound even when they bypass this manager or a worker pool.
Queued cancellation returns the permit, and runtime startup retains its existing
subprocess cleanup on cancellation or failure. Both queues are ordered by start
priority: `get_or_create(..., start_priority=)` names it and defaults to
BACKGROUND (rule: `kiro_crew.start_priority`). `_start_sem`
(`session_allocation.new_cold_start_semaphore`) carries a reserve on top of the
background width that only a FOREGROUND start may hold, and the identity sweep's
barrier is `_start_sem.drain()`. The claimers, the guarantee and its bounds:
[acp-client](acp-client.md) § Session-start gate.

**Parallel step throttling**: TaskRunner limits concurrent step sessions
to `max_parallel_steps` (default 2) via `asyncio.Semaphore`. Cold starts
are staggered by 3s. A system load guard pauses spawning when CPU load
exceeds 85% of available cores.

## Compaction Race Handling

In-place compaction (both backends) keeps the `_sessions` entry healthy:
a concurrent `get_or_create()` reuses it, queueing on the session
semaphore behind the compact, then continues on the compacted session.

Only the kiro-cli failure recycle tears the entry down, and it runs inside
`_compact_in_place` under the turn semaphore that the compact attempt
already holds — never after releasing it. That is load-bearing: releasing
first and re-acquiring for the recycle leaves a gap a queued turn wins, and
that turn is then dispatched into a kiro-cli still finishing its compaction,
receives the late `completed` status instead of an `end_turn`, and hangs
holding the semaphore until the prompt timeout.

The recycle records the
exact session object under teardown in `_recycling` (distinct from
`_compacting`, which is just the trigger dedup gate): `get_or_create()`
skips reuse only when the map still holds that exact object, then
cold-starts fresh — a healthy replacement registered under the same key
during the teardown is reused normally, never overwritten. The recycle
pops by object identity — if a racing cold-start already replaced the
entry, only the old session object is shut down; the fresh replacement
and its session_map entry survive (the old provider is still reaped so
its process never leaks).
