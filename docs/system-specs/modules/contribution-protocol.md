# Contribution protocol

Owners: `kiro_crew.eventlog` (log, projections, `contrib`, `grants`), `kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers.eventlog`, `kiro_crew.dashboard.eventlog_ws`, `website/src/state/memberProjectionStore.ts`

Status: implemented for kind `member`. The three workstreams build against this surface; anything a
workstream needs that is not here is a change to THIS file first.

## 1. Purpose

An out-of-process contributor — an app backend, or an adapter hosting a foreign plugin model — can read a
unit's append-only log, append events into it under its own namespace, and publish projected views that
the gateway treats exactly like its own. The gateway stays the only writer of every log, enforces
ownership and quota at the boundary, and pushes contributed views to dashboards with the same
whole-value frames it uses for built-in projections. Nothing in this protocol depends on the
contributor's language.

The unit kinds are those with a log. Today: `member`. The protocol is written for any kind: `kind` is a
path segment resolved against a registry (`eventlog.contrib.register_unit`), so a second kind is a
registration rather than a second set of routes.

## 2. Identity and authority

A contributor authenticates as an **app** with the app token it already holds (exchanged from its
`.app_secret` at `POST /api/apps/{name}/token`). Everything it may do is declared in its manifest:

```json
"contributions": {
  "events":      ["myapp/*"],
  "projections": ["myapp/*"],
  "units":       ["member"]
}
```

- An event `type` a contributor appends MUST match one of its declared `events` patterns, and every
  pattern MUST begin with the app's own name followed by `/`. The gateway refuses anything else. The
  prefix is re-checked at USE, not trusted from install: a manifest is a file an app trusted to run code
  can rewrite.
- A projection `key` a contributor publishes MUST match one of its declared `projections` patterns,
  same prefix rule. Built-in keys (`roster`, `activity`, `wake`, `driving`) cannot be published from
  outside.
- `units` lists the kinds the contributor may subscribe to and append to. An app that declares none
  can do nothing here. Declaring `events` or `projections` with no `units` is refused at install.
  Declaring a kind is not the same as being granted it: see "Approved kinds" below.

**Approved kinds.** `events` and `projections` are guarded by their `<app>/` prefix, which the
gateway re-checks on every request, so a manifest that claims a pattern outside the app's own
namespace is ignored. A unit KIND has no such prefix — `member` is the gateway's name, not the
app's — so the same re-check cannot guard it, and a manifest is a file the app's own code can
rewrite. The gateway therefore keeps its own record of the kinds that were approved, and a request
is granted a kind only when the manifest still declares it AND that record already holds it.

That record is `app-unit-approvals.json` in the gateway's own configuration directory, one file
keyed by app name. It lives there rather than beside the app because an app trusted to run code can
rewrite every file in its own directory, including its `installed.json`: an approval stored there
could be forged by the very backend it is meant to constrain, and the intersection above would then
grant a kind the operator never approved. The file is sealed read-only inside the agent sandbox for
the same reason. An app with no entry approves nothing, so a missing or unreadable file denies
rather than grants.

The record is written at install and at update, from the manifest the operator installed. An
update may widen it; an update that fails leaves it exactly as it was, because the approvals write
lands only after the replacement is durable. A self-registration through the App Kit API runs under
the app's own token, so it may only narrow the record — dropping a kind it no longer wants — never
add one. Uninstalling an app drops its entry.

An app whose declaration has grown past its approved kinds keeps running and keeps every other
grant; it simply contributes to none of the unapproved kinds. The unapproved names are reported on
the app's own record as `unitsPendingApproval`, and an install or update is what clears them. An
app absent from the approvals record reads as approving nothing, so it is in exactly this state
until it is updated.
- Patterns glob with `*` and match case-sensitively.
- Reading is granted per kind, not per event type: a subscriber sees every event of a unit it may
  subscribe to. Sensitive data therefore does not belong in an event; it belongs in the durable store the
  event points at.
- A DISABLED app is refused everything, even though its token still validates, and disabling
  invalidates the cached grant immediately rather than at the end of its TTL.

Declaring `contributions` grants the HTTP paths and frames below; no separate `permissions.api` entry is
needed. Widening a declaration on upgrade is a new consent, handled like any other widened permission —
the declaration is covered by the manifest signature, so widening it on a signed app invalidates that
signature.

The log's own event vocabulary admits `<namespace>/<name>` for any namespace the built-ins do not own
(`member`, `activity`, `slot`, `patrol`). A type inside a reserved namespace that is not a known
built-in is a typo, not a contribution, and is still refused.

## 3. Reading: catch-up then stream

```
GET /api/eventlog/{kind}/{id}/events?after=<seq>&limit=<1..500>
  -> { "kind", "id", "<idField>", "events": [envelope...], "lastSeq": n }   oldest first, seq > after
```

`after` defaults to -1 (from the beginning); `limit` defaults to 200. An out-of-range `limit` is
refused rather than clamped: a consumer that asked for 5000 and silently received 200 would read a
short page as the end of the log. The response carries the id twice — once as `id` and once under the
kind's own field name (`slug` for a member) — so a consumer can key on either.

Over the app's WebSocket:

```
-> { "type": "eventlog_subscribe",   "data": { "kind", "id" } }
<- { "type": "eventlog_subscribed",  "data": { "kind", "id", "<idField>", "lastSeq": n } }
<- { "type": "eventlog_event",       "data": { "kind", "id", "<idField>", "event": envelope } }
-> { "type": "eventlog_unsubscribe", "data": { "kind", "id" } }
```

A REFUSED subscribe answers `eventlog_subscribed` with `code` and `error` and NO `lastSeq`, rather than
closing the socket: that socket multiplexes everything else the app uses, and a contributor that asked
for the wrong kind needs to be told, not dropped.

`eventlog_subscribed` is sent before any `eventlog_event` for that subscription. The event channel is a
**delta channel**: the consumer MUST check `event.seq === last + 1` and, on a gap, drop its fold and
re-read from `GET .../events?after=` — never fold across a gap. A subscriber that disconnects resumes
by catch-up from its last folded seq, then re-subscribes. The gateway closes a slow subscriber (256
frames queued) rather than growing its queue; a closed subscriber resumes the same way. One socket may
hold at most 64 subscriptions.

## 4. Appending

```
POST /api/eventlog/{kind}/{id}/events
  { "type": "myapp/thing-happened", "data": {...} }
  -> 201 envelope            | 403 code=event_type_not_owned | 404 code=unit_not_found
                             | 413 code=event_too_large | 429 code=quota_exceeded
                             | 400 code=invalid_projection_value
```

The gateway assigns `seq` and `time`; a contributor never supplies them, and a supplied value is
ignored rather than refused — the returned envelope carries the authoritative pair. `data` is limited
to 64 KiB serialized AND to 32 levels of nesting (`eventlog.types.MAX_VALUE_DEPTH`): every read and
every live frame runs the recursive redaction pass, so a size-legal but deeper payload would turn into
a `RecursionError` at the network boundary instead of a refusal at the door. Depth is checked BEFORE
serialization, because `json.dumps` recurses too.

Each app has a per-unit event budget (default 10,000 events per unit per UTC day); over budget is
refused, never queued, and charged BEFORE the write so a refusal never spends it. A charge whose append
then FAILS is released against the day it was charged, so a run of disk failures cannot spend a budget
the log has nothing to show for — the budget counts events that exist.

The budget lives in gateway memory: it bounds one process's exposure to a runaway contributor, and the
64 KiB cap already bounds the resource a persisted counter would protect.

## 5. Publishing a projection

```
POST /api/eventlog/{kind}/{id}/projections/{key}
  { "value": <json>, "seq": n, "stateVersion": v }
  -> 204                      | 403 code=projection_key_not_owned | 409 code=stale_seq
                              | 413 code=projection_too_large
```

`seq` is the log position the view is current as of. The gateway keeps one row per `(kind, id, key)`:
a publish with `seq` lower than or equal to the stored row is refused with `409 stale_seq` (a replay,
or a slower contributor); higher wins and is pushed to dashboards as the existing
`member_projection` frame `{slug, key, value, seq, stateVersion, schema?}` (for kind `member`; other kinds get a frame
of the same shape named for the kind). Contributed rows appear in the unit's `projections.values` block
next to built-in keys, so a dashboard needs no new code path to receive them.

`value` is limited to 640 KiB serialized — ten times the event cap, because a folded view legitimately
summarises many events, but not unbounded: this value is pushed whole to every dashboard socket. It
carries the same 32-level depth bound as an event's `data`, for the same reason.

The NUMBER of keys is bounded too: one app may retain at most 64 projection keys per unit
(`eventlog.contrib.MAX_PROJECTION_KEYS_PER_APP_UNIT`), and a new key past that is refused with
`409 projection_limit`. A size cap alone bounds each row and not their number, so a wildcard
`<app>/*` grant would otherwise let a contributor retain unique keys without end, each one held in
memory and rewritten to disk on every publish. The cap is per APP, so one noisy contributor cannot
crowd out another's cards, and it applies to a schema-only publish as well — that path creates a row
too. Re-publishing a key the app already holds is never refused by it: the bound is on retention.

Rows live at `<data home>/crew-log/contrib/<kind>/<unit>.json`, inside the fenced crew-log tree and a
sibling of the per-kind roots. They are AUTHORITY, not cache: the store trusts what is on disk and the
drawer renders it, so a row an agent could write with its own file tools would be attacker-authored app
state on the user's page. That leaf is the one both fences name -- the file-tool gate in
`security.paths` and the sandbox mask in `sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES` -- so the store inherits both
without a third entry to keep in step, which is the same move that put the member log there.

`stateVersion` is the contributor's fold version. A publish with a higher `stateVersion` than the stored
row replaces it regardless of `seq`, so a contributor that changed its fold can re-publish from zero. A
LOWER `stateVersion` is refused as stale.

Rows are durable. A contributor publishes on its own cadence, so an in-memory table would blank every
contributed card on a gateway restart and leave the page empty until that contributor happened to
re-fold.

The `projections` block on a roster row therefore carries three maps:

```
"projections": {
  "asOfSeq": 12,
  "values":  { "roster": {...}, "myapp/count": {...} },
  "seqs":    { "myapp/count": 7 },
  "stateVersions": { "myapp/count": 2 },
  "schemas": { "myapp/count": {"kind": "badge"} }
}
```

`seqs`, `stateVersions` and `schemas` are present only for contributed rows. `seqs` is REQUIRED rather
than cosmetic: a contributed row's seq is the contributor's own fold position, not the response's
`asOfSeq`, and a client that seeded it at `asOfSeq` would drop the contributor's next live push and
freeze the card at its baseline. `stateVersions` is REQUIRED for the same kind of reason one step up: a
row is ordered by `(stateVersion, seq)`, in that order, which is the rule the publish door itself
enforces, so a client given only the seq would be applying a weaker rule than the rows were written
under.

Folding happens in the contributor's process, against events read through §3. The gateway never
executes contributor code.

## 6. Teardown

Disabling or uninstalling an app: the gateway invalidates the app's grant, closes the app's
subscriptions (the socket itself, not just the subscription — the app's code is being stopped), deletes
every projection row the app published, and pushes a frame with `value: null` for each key. Events the
app appended stay in the log — they are history, and the log is never rewritten.

The order matters: the grant comes off FIRST, before the app's own shutdown hooks run, so an in-flight
append cannot land after the rows it folds into are deleted.

The deletion frame carries the row's own `seq` and its `stateVersion` ADVANCED by one. No sentinel
sequence is involved: ordering is `(stateVersion, seq)`, so advancing the version is what makes the
deletion outrank the row it clears — including a row a contributor left sitting at a very high seq,
which a seq-only rule could never beat.

A client MUST drop the row on a null rather than retain it at the advanced version. A retained
tombstone would outrank the real updates of a re-enabled app, and a re-enabled app cannot know which
version to publish past, because the gateway advanced it rather than the app. Refusing a publish that
arrives from the RETIRED version is not the client's job: the grant comes off before the rows are
deleted (see the order above) and a publish commits behind a grant-generation fence, so the gateway does
not send one. A client renders no card for a key it holds no row for.

## 7. Rendering contributed views

A dashboard surface that shows a unit renders unknown `<app>/<key>` views generically: a card titled
by the key (or by a published `title`), badged with the app's name, and a body rendered from the value
by a small declarative schema the contributor may publish once per key:

```
POST /api/eventlog/{kind}/{id}/projections/{key}/schema
  { "title": "...", "kind": "badge|text|list|table|keyvalue", "path": ["selector", ...] }
  -> 204                      | 403 code=projection_key_not_owned
                              | 400 code=invalid_projection_value
```

`path` selectors are dotted paths into the value, read per kind: the first selector picks the array for
`list` and `table` (and the remaining ones name the table's columns), and the whole list names the
fields to show for `keyvalue`, `badge` and `text`. An absent or unusable schema falls back to a compact
key-value dump. Unknown schema fields are DROPPED rather than stored: the browser renders from this, so
an unrecognised field would be a rendering the host never agreed to.

A schema may be published before the first fold; such a row renders nothing until a value arrives. A
schema is sticky across later value publishes, which carry none.

No contributor code runs in the browser, and every string is truncated before it reaches the DOM.

## 8. Adapters

An adapter is an app whose backend process hosts a foreign plugin runtime and implements that runtime's
service surface as shims over §3–§5 and over the existing MCP and cron surfaces. The plugin code is
unmodified. Each foreign plugin model gets one adapter; the protocol does not change per adapter.

## 9. Error codes

Every error response carries a machine-readable `code`, and each code maps to exactly ONE HTTP status
(`eventlog.contrib.STATUS_FOR_CODE`) — a code whose status drifts per call site says less than it
appears to:

| code | status |
|---|---|
| `event_type_not_owned` | 403 |
| `projection_key_not_owned` | 403 |
| `unit_kind_not_granted` | 403 |
| `unit_not_found` | 404 |
| `stale_seq` | 409 |
| `projection_limit` | 409 |
| `event_too_large` | 413 |
| `projection_too_large` | 413 |
| `quota_exceeded` | 429 |
| `invalid_after` | 400 |
| `invalid_limit` | 400 |
| `invalid_projection_value` | 400 |

A dashboard-user token is refused on every route here with `unit_kind_not_granted`: the gateway's own
writes go through the service directly, so the only legitimate caller is a contributor.

## 10. Worked example

`test/contrib_protocol_demo.py` is a complete contributor in ~200 lines of standard-library Python:
it exchanges its app secret for a token, catches up with `GET .../events?after=`, subscribes over the
WebSocket, appends `demo/ping`, folds a `demo/count` view locally, publishes it with the schema, and
proves the gap rule by dropping its socket and catching up again.
