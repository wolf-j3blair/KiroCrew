# Module specs

One spec per backend subsystem. **These are change-control contracts:** read the
spec for the subsystem you are touching before you change it, and update it in the
same commit when you change what it documents.

This is also the on-demand load target for an AI session. The routing table in
[`../../../AGENTS.md`](../../../AGENTS.md) maps a subsystem to its spec here, so an
agent loads only the one it needs.

## Core runtime

| Spec | Subsystem |
|---|---|
| [acp-client.md](acp-client.md) | The ACP JSON-RPC clients that drive supported harnesses: dedicated and shared transports, framing, timeouts, and the backend seam. |
| [providers.md](providers.md) | The `LLMProvider` interface, the `AcpProvider` the factory selects, and how a backend id is chosen. |
| [agent-host-contract.md](agent-host-contract.md) | What every known agent backend supplies besides speaking ACP: agent layout, session store, identity, sandbox, MCP delivery, billing, permission engine, auxiliary runtimes, and the new-provider checklist. |
| [claude-code-provider.md](claude-code-provider.md) | Claude Code as a selectable ACP harness: the live spawn path, the two binaries it needs on the machine, and the MCP gap a Claude session still carries. |
| [harness-parity.md](harness-parity.md) | The invariants keeping the Kiro harness first-class while other harnesses are adapted, and the test pinning each. |
| [harness-onboarding.md](harness-onboarding.md) | The sequence a new ACP harness walks to land: vocabulary, capability decisions, spawn path, handshake, install probe, selectability, and what a live harness additionally touches. |
| [model-fallback.md](model-fallback.md) | The throttle-exhaustion model fallback (`agent.fallback_model`): trigger, shared walk, sticky restore, visibility — plus the single-message content-filter refusal fallback (`agent.refusal_fallback_model`). |
| [session.md](session.md) | Sessions, slots, session keys, the warm pool, and PID tracking. |
| [runtime-ownership.md](runtime-ownership.md) | Who owns an agent process: the lease and tenancy tables, the one kill gate, death classification, the kernel-versus-registry reconciler, and the pid-reader guards. |
| [history.md](history.md) | Conversation persistence, JSONL rotation, and transcript search. |
| [session-summary.md](session-summary.md) | Intent-level session summaries: the sidecar cache, extraction, and the turn-end pass. |
| [member-event-log.md](member-event-log.md) | Per-member append-only event log, its four projections, the whole-value push frames, and load-time closers behind the Members page. |
| [contribution-protocol.md](contribution-protocol.md) | How an installed app contributes to a member's event log: the `contributions` manifest declaration that grants it, the single write door, the fenced root its projection rows live under, the per-unit ceiling, and the subscribe/catch-up delta channel. |
| [session-work-ledger.md](session-work-ledger.md) | Per-session durable work state (goal, phase, tried, artifacts) on disk, its MCP tools, and monitor-loop snapshot injection. |
| [crew-log-core.md](crew-log-core.md) | Append-only per-crew and per-session crew logs: the wire format, type ownership and guest namespacing, the torn-tail rule, and the pre-release status of the session vocabulary. |
| [crew-log-emitter.md](crew-log-emitter.md) | The flag-gated writer that turns the ACP turn lifecycle into an append-only per-session `log.jsonl`: which facts are recorded, from which call site, and which are deliberately not. |
| [crew-log-projection.md](crew-log-projection.md) | The six session folds (`status`, `usage`, `timeline`, `tools`, `approvals`, `subagents`), their resumable checkpoints, the paged `crew-log` reads with refs resolved, and the `session_projection` push. |
| [file-search.md](file-search.md) | The `@`-mention file/folder search: index, ranking, `kinds` filter, and the sensitive-path symmetry. |
| [session-storage.md](session-storage.md) | What sessions cost on disk, and the user-initiated trash that reclaims it. |
| [session-control.md](session-control.md) | One chat session opening, stopping, and reading another. |
| [config.md](config.md) | The config schema, defaults, loading, and live reload. |

| [metrics.md](metrics.md) | Duration histograms, system metrics, and the loop-stall watchdog. |
| [sel.md](sel.md) | The security event log: what is audited and how it is signed. |

| Spec | Subsystem |
|---|---|
| [subagent.md](subagent.md) | Spawning background workers, result delivery, and orphan recovery. |
| [adaptive-concurrency.md](adaptive-concurrency.md) | The adaptive concurrency controller: a runtime execution cap beneath the user's ceiling and the MCP daemon's spawn-gate capacity, halved on corroborated host pressure, +1 per clean window, pause-and-probe under severe pressure; provider throttling scoped to its dependency channel. |
| [taskq.md](taskq.md) | The durable task queue under every accepted unit of work: `tasks.db`, the validated state machine, write-before-ack, atomic claim with lease and generation fencing, the bounded dispatch window, legacy import and reconcile-first boot. |

| [agent-interrupt-controller.md](agent-interrupt-controller.md) | `kiro_crew.irq`: masking, coalescing, epoch resets and an error backstop for script-cron pollers, so a cheap probe interrupts an expensive agent turn instead of the turn polling. Also the app-facing probe SDK. |
| [babysit-pr-watch.md](babysit-pr-watch.md) | Zero-token PR polling for babysit loops: a script cron that wakes the owning session only on unexpected state. |
| [task.md](task.md) | Task models and state. |
| [taskrunner.md](taskrunner.md) | The execution engine that runs a task spec to completion. |

| [crew-mode.md](crew-mode.md) | Crews: the config record, `select_crew` roster and binding, model and workspace resolution, the Crews UI, and the record of the retired `"crew"` slot mode (Crew Mode). |
| [pipeline-conductor.md](pipeline-conductor.md) | The `kirocrew-pipeline-conductor` agent and its skill: the generated spec's permission narrowing, the three deterministic scripts, the patrol cycle, and what the RFC leaves unbuilt. |
