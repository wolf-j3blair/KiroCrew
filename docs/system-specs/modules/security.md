# Security Module

## Overview

Bulk skill enumeration still validates every canonical path against fresh sensitive
targets. A canonical path without a keystone artifact suffix cannot be a publish
artifact, so that second target lookup is skipped; suffixed paths retain the artifact
check. Candidate resolution, sensitive anchors and the no-link body reader are unchanged.
During a target-set rebuild, identical override leaves shared by the two supported
Crew home prefixes are resolved once. These answers live only for that build;
the target cache's TTL and fresh root checks are unchanged.

The subprocess audit lists two fixed test-harness sites separately:
`testing/harness.py::_launch_gateway` starts the package's gateway, while
`testing/harness.py::spawn_feature_gateway` runs the literal seed program before
its optional preflight callback. Both use the test supervisor's isolated home
and checkout source. The seed fixture name is an argv data value, not code;
fixture containment, protected-home and nonempty-target guards remain active,
with a 30-second subprocess timeout. This does not exempt dynamic projected MCP
commands: those retain the sandbox chokepoint and the AST routing audit.

Kiro Crew implements defense-in-depth security across multiple layers: OS-level process isolation, credential path protection, input/output validation, authentication, authorization, and audit logging. This document consolidates all security controls and the vulnerabilities they address.

### MCP launch authorization leaves

The `approvals.json` file in the crew-home `mcp-launch-approvals/` directory
records operator-approved fingerprints for stubbed MCP launches. A fingerprint
covers the declared environment text, so a changed `${VAR}` value keeps an
approved launch approved only when the environment sidecar publishes; a failed
sidecar pass persists no rebind. A changed declared text does not keep approval.
A command, argument or declared-env path segment that is byte-identical to one
of three spellings the gateway computes from itself -- `sys.executable`, the
`deps_boot` shim path, the `kiro_crew` package's parent directory -- is hashed by
role, so the approval names the gateway's own interpreter and package rather than
the versioned directory a release places them in. Each folds only in its own
slot: the interpreter only as the command, the shim only as an argument, the
package directory only as a `PYTHONPATH` segment; the same string anywhere else
hashes as written. There is no prefix containment
and no case folding: a token either IS one of those strings or hashes as written,
so no agent-chosen spelling reaches a different file through the fold. The
encoding opens with a byte no UTF-8 token can contain, so no spelled-out argv or
env value collides with it. An approval of such a launch recorded before the
encoding existed is refused once as `changed_needs_reapproval` and re-approved
by the operator; the store never admits the pre-encoding digest.
The residual: `${VAR}` values come from the gateway environment, so an
unsealed source of it (such as a writable shell rc file) changes an approved
launch's values silently instead of surfacing as a refusal.
Every writer publishes the store by rename, so
the seal is its DIRECTORY: the file-tool gate denies writes under
`mcp-launch-approvals/`, and the OS sandbox mounts that precreated directory
read-only with a strict no-symlink check. Empty and absent forms both approve
nothing. A refusal displays each command with its redacted,
bounded declared environment. Every identity serialized into `expected_launch`
has exactly one displayed command and one displayed environment, so the operator
can approve only launch content that was rendered. Cached recommendation seeding
can add a stub route, but it does not approve the launch behind that name.

The generated `mcp-gateway/agents/` overlays and `mcp-gateway/stubs/` sidecars
are not sealed: gatewayd checks the command and environment they carry against
the approved fingerprint at launch, so tampered content fails closed. The
`mcp/resolved/` tree supplies the executable substituted for a resolved npm
launcher. It is file-tool write-protected, OS-sandbox read-only, and a strict
no-symlink mount target. Linux precreates it before bind mounting it, so a fresh
data home has the same disposition as one that already contains resolved
launches. Its writers are gateway-side. The
resolve-once npm child stays sandboxed and installs into a private directory
under the sealed `run/` parent. The existing validated runtime carve-out grants
that child write access to only the random staging directory; it cannot cover
`record.json` or another resolution. After validating the tree, the gateway
process renames it into `mcp/resolved/` and writes `record.json`.

### Member memory boundaries

Cold subagent continuation restores app ownership from the canonical
`subagents/` run records; retained V1 runs can still read their existing
`member-memory-bindings/` sidecar. Both roots keep ordinary sandbox read-only
protection, including empty-root precreation and refusal of redirected roots,
and writes through the agent's file tools stay refused for both. They differ on
the READ side, and what separates them is the record's contents rather than its
position. `subagents/` is on the file-tool write-only gate, so its results
remain readable. A `member-memory-bindings/` record carries the RAW session key
it binds, so the leaf is on the read+write floor (`_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`): the
agent's own file tools may not open one, and
`agent_sdk.tool_gate.adapter_hidden_credential_dirs` projects that floor into an
enforced adapter's OS credential mask. The one legitimate reader,
`subagent_persistence.read_run_execution`, opens the sidecar directly in the
gateway and never consults this gate, so cold continuation of a retained V1 run
still resolves its app owner, and Gateway writers remain functional. This
protects app authorization integrity without a separate grant, duplicate
execution record or cross-member read restriction.

Two crew-webview leaves carry their own dispositions. `crew-panels/` holds the
per-crew published panel record and is HIDDEN from agent processes, precreated
before the sandbox spawns for the same reason `memory_stores/` is: a directory
that appears later cannot become visible in an older namespace. `panel-templates/`
holds the human-authored template and is exposed READ-ONLY, and is additionally
listed in `security._WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS` rather than on the read-plus-write
floor, so the operator who authored a template can still read it back through the
agent file tools and the dashboard viewer while no agent can rewrite it. The
asymmetry is the point: the separation between the operator's template and the
crew's published data is what the containment story rests on, so the write is the
threat and the read is not.

Both are also in `sandbox._CREW_NO_ALIAS_LEAVES`, which REFUSES the spawn when the
leaf is reachable under a second name — a symlink, or a regular file carrying an
extra hardlink. Every other SEALED ceiling only warns and continues, because a
user who symlinks a config file into a dotfiles repository is doing something
ordinary and refusing would turn a normal setup into a spawn failure over a
pre-existing hole. Neither of these is a config file and nothing has a reason to
link either one, so the weaker outcome is not worth its cost here: `crew-panels/`
is bind-masked, so an alias attaches the mask to the target while the link name
stays writable, letting a sandboxed process drop its own directory and forge
records the gateway reads back as authoritative past both the ownership check and
the redactors; and replacing `panel-templates/` is authoring markup that renders
in the panel rather than changing a setting. A warning was what made this silent —
the log said the path was sealed while the writes went elsewhere.

Gateway-validated ACP effort markers live under
`crew-panels/validated_effort_levels/`. The existing `crew-panels` mask is
precreated and follows a relocated data home; the agent file-tool floor also
fences that whole parent. The panel record reader uses flat `.json` names, so
the marker subdirectory is outside its record namespace. Reusing this masked
parent avoids adding another root-level leaf held only by its own mount name.

The MASKED leaves are a separate population with a separate pass.
`sandbox._refuse_aliased_masked_leaves` refuses a SYMLINK at every entry in
`_CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES` except the ones in `_CREW_ALIAS_TOLERATED_LEAVES`, and it runs last
on the spawn path so a leaf carrying its own tailored refusal (`live_target.json`, whose
sentence is shared with `kirocrew doctor`, and the md-notebook state leaves) answers first
and keeps its own wording. It creates nothing, so an absent store is skipped rather than
materialised, which is what lets one pass cover the masked leaves nothing precreates,
including the retired `ledgers` root that must not be re-created on every machine. It
checks the leaf AND every component below the data home: `lstat` un-follows only the final
component, so a link planted at an intermediate of a multi-component leaf
(`apps/aws-control/data`, `apps/meetings/data/edits`) would otherwise land the mask on an
attacker-chosen tree while the lexical name stayed replaceable. The data home itself and
its parents are deliberately not walked, because `config_dir()` documents that a symlinked
data HOME is supported.

**That pass decides ABOUT a name; the mount it protects binds an OBJECT, and the two are
kept the same object on both sides.** The pass runs in the gateway and the mask mounts in
the launcher child, so a name swapped between them is judged once and bound twice.
`_pin_mount_path` resolves each mask target ONCE into an `O_PATH` descriptor, classifies it
with `fstat` on that descriptor, and the mount takes `/proc/self/fd/<fd>` — a path that
names the object the descriptor holds however the name reads by then.

**The expectation is CARRIED from the gateway, not taken again in the child.** A look taken
inside the launcher lands on the far side of the script build, the `mkstemp` that writes it
and the `fork`/`unshare`, so an occupant read there and compared there answers about the same
instant twice and closes nothing. `_refuse_aliased_masked_leaves` already `lstat`s every crew
hidden leaf to refuse an aliased one, so it records what it saw at no extra syscall; the four
materialisers' established targets and `~/.ssh` are added beside it. The builder serialises
that map as `MASK_OCCUPANTS` and probes nothing, which is the property
`test_the_builder_does_not_stat_the_hidden_paths` pins for it. `_pin_mount_path` then looks
its OWN target up in that map rather than taking an `expect_occupant` argument from each
caller: every hiding mount reaches that one function, so binding the check to the function
makes a new call site covered the day it is written, with no keyword for it to forget.

**Not every masked target carries one, and the boundary is measured rather than assumed.** A
strict spawn masks 409 targets; 99 of them are observed by a pre-spawn pass and 310 are not,
including `~/.aws`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.kube`, `~/.docker`, `.config/gcloud` and the read-only
ceiling set. Requiring a carried identity for a name no pass observed would mean refusing a
link there, which is the `stow` cost above charged on exactly the directories a dotfile
manager symlinks. Observing all 409 in the gateway is the other tempting answer and is worse:
it puts a per-target probe per spawn back on the single event loop, which is the defect
`test_the_builder_does_not_stat_the_hidden_paths` exists to describe. So a name with no
carried entry keeps the previous behaviour -- the mask covers what the link resolves to -- and
that residual is stated here rather than left to read as covered.

**The comparison is on DEVICE AND INODE, and it carries NO exceptions.** Weaker attributes do
not identify an object: comparing only link-ness admits a same-kind decoy, because a directory
swapped for another directory satisfies it while the real tree sits unmasked at whatever name
the writer moved it to. An inode is what the five findings on this path were all asking for.

**One changed occupant is the mask itself, and the launcher knows it by identity.** A mask
list can carry one object under two spellings: a symlinked `$HOME` makes the data home read
as relocated to `_relocated_crew_targets`, which compares `normpath` spellings and
deliberately never resolves on the event loop, so every crew hidden leaf is listed under the
link's spelling and the resolved one, while `_refuse_aliased_masked_leaves` deduplicates by
inode and records an expectation for the resolved spelling only. The launcher masks the first
spelling by binding a stand-in over it; the second spelling then reaches that stand-in, whose
identity is not the recorded one. A pin that judged that by identity alone would read it as a
swapped object and refuse every spawn on such a host. So the launcher records, in `_OWN_STAND_INS`, the `(dev, ino)` of every stand-in it creates mapped
to the `(dev, ino)` of the object it is bound over -- read off the pinned descriptor the
mount goes through, at every mask loop, before the mount. A changed occupant that IS a
stand-in registered against the very object this name's expectation carries is the mask in
place, and the pin skips the name. Both halves of that condition are load-bearing. Only the
entry AT the name counts, read no-follow, never a link's referent: a same-UID writer can
plant a link at a protected name aimed into the directory that holds the stand-ins, and
following it would read as "already masked" while the real tree sits renamed aside. And the
stand-in must be the one bound over THIS object, not merely one this launcher made: the
stand-in source falls back to the system tempdir when no tmpfs is on a separate filesystem,
and there the same writer can rename an enumerable stand-in onto a protected name -- a
stand-in registered against a different object refuses like any other swapped-in directory.
The stand-in registered against this object sits on a mount over this object's own entry,
which no rename moves (`EBUSY` on a mount point), so a match can only be the launcher's own
mount reached by another name.

**An ABSENT name under a directory the launcher already masked is that same mask, seen from
below.** A mask list carries a leaf together with a directory above it -- a readiness probe
hides the whole data home while every crew hidden leaf under it stays listed, and a
symlinked `$HOME` lists both spellings of each -- and once the directory's stand-in is bound
the leaf is gone from every later look at its name: the directory loop reaching it after its
parent, and the file loop, which is offered every directory entry and always runs after. The
leaf's expectation is still carried, so the absence branch alone would refuse it as a vanished
object, and did: with the whole-home hide every probe spawn refused at
`~/.kiro/crew/diag`, `/api/models` answered 503 and Settings reported `Failed to load config`.
So the launcher also records, in `_MASKED_NAMES`, every NAME it has confirmed reaches one of
its own stand-ins -- each mask the loops mount and read back, and each second spelling the
pin finds already covered -- and an absent name is skipped when a proper ancestor of it is
recorded there AND, resolved again now, still reaches the stand-in recorded for it
(`_covered_by_own_mask`). Names rather than identities, because the second spelling of a
masked directory holds no mount of its own and no expectation to compare a stand-in against,
yet covers the leaves under it all the same. The re-resolution is load-bearing: the record
says what the ancestor reached when its mask was placed, and the question is what covers the
leaf at this instant, so a recorded ancestor that no longer reaches its stand-in refuses the
leaf rather than walking higher. A link at the ancestor is accepted only when it is the link
the pin itself followed, as the read-back accepts it. A private window met on the way up ends
the walk with a refusal: the window mounts the real tree back over the stand-in, read-write, so
a leaf beneath it (`apps/meetings/data/edits` under the `apps/meetings/data` window) resolves
into that real tree and no stand-in above covers it -- its absence at the nested re-hide is the
leaf having moved, and the launcher records every window it binds (`_BOUND_WINDOWS`) so the
walk can tell. The builder's lexical subtraction of
nested `REQUIRED_MASK_TARGETS` remains: it answers for a target whose ancestor is in the
mask LIST, this answers for one whose ancestor has a mask IN PLACE, and the second spelling
is in the second set but not the first.

The cost of having no exceptions is that EVERY inode change at a protected name refuses,
and some inode changes are ordinary rather than hostile:

| Change at the name | Outcome | Ordinary cause |
|---|---|---|
| untouched | proceeds | -- |
| real object recreated | REFUSES | a staging directory rebuilt mid-flight (`aws-control-staging`, measured) |
| real object atomically rewritten | REFUSES | any `atomic_write` / `os.replace` publish; the helper renames onto the destination, so the inode always changes |
| symlink recreated | REFUSES | a dotfile manager restow |
| real object replaced by a symlink | REFUSES | the substitution this exists to catch |
| symlink replaced by a real object | REFUSES | a dotfile manager unlinking |

Which of those a sandbox should permit is a decision about what the operator's own tooling may
do to a protected name while an agent is running. It is not derivable from the launcher, and a
list invented there would either break ordinary hosts or quietly reopen the hole, so the code
carries none and says so at the comparison. This table is the list to choose from.

**The FIRST look does not follow, and a link is still followed once -- those are two
different statements and both are needed.** A link occupying a protected name has two
unrelated causes wanting opposite answers: an ordinary `stow` or `chezmoi` layout has had
one there since before the gateway started, and refusing it fails every strict spawn on a
supported machine; a link SUBSTITUTED for a directory while the launcher looks is a
redirect, and following it masks the planter's decoy while the real directory, renamed
aside, stays readable. Nothing at a single instant separates them -- both show a link -- so
the launcher does not try. `_name_occupant` opens the name `O_PATH | O_NOFOLLOW`, which
does not refuse a link but returns a descriptor on the link ITSELF, and reports the
identity of whatever occupies the name. The pin takes that identity back as
`expect_occupant` and refuses when a later look finds a DIFFERENT occupant. A link that was
already there is the same link at both looks and passes; a directory replaced by a link is
not. `O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW` would refuse a link outright instead, and that refusal
lands on the supported layout rather than on the planter, which is why it is not used.
Once the occupant is known, a link is followed exactly ONCE so the mask covers the store
the keys actually live in, as the `isdir`/`isfile` guards it replaces did, so a supported
symlinked data home keeps working. Pinning alone closes only half the window:
with the mask on the inspected object, a rename leaves the NAME reaching the racing
writer's replacement — not a leak of what was there, a WRITABLE object at a protected name,
which for the leaves the gateway reads back as authoritative buys forged records. So
`_verify_masked_name` re-resolves the name after each hiding mount and REQUIRES it to reach
that mount's stand-in. The read-only ceiling seal reaches the same invariant by the same
step in the other direction: its remount can only name the mount its bind just created, so
it re-resolves once and requires the object it reaches to be the object it bound.

**Five refusal classes are new on the spawn path, and each fails CLOSED**: a target that
exists and cannot be pinned (`open` denied where `stat` succeeded), a masked name whose
occupant changed between a caller's first look and its pin, a masked name that does
not reach its stand-in afterwards, a ceiling whose identity changed between being bound
and being sealed, and a protected target that was present pre-spawn and absent by the time
the child mounts. That last one is decided in two places, and the split is forced rather
than stylistic. WHICH targets were seen present is recorded by the pre-spawn passes
themselves, at every branch where they accept an object — one they created, one already
there, and one a concurrent creator won and they then re-validated — because those passes
are already statting and creating off the event loop. The launcher builder is handed that
set as DATA and probes nothing: `test_the_builder_does_not_stat_the_hidden_paths` pins that
it must not, since on a stalled home a single probe there blocks the one loop every session,
cron and heartbeat shares. Then the builder makes the one judgement that is purely LEXICAL —
it subtracts any target nested under a directory the launcher masks EARLIER, because that
parent's empty mask is what hides the child, so the child's absence at pin time is
ordinary and not a race. **The predicate is that distinction, not presence.** Requiring a
nested target refuses every spawn on a host that merely has the parent store, and no
filesystem answer can tell the two absences apart — only the path relationship can. A
target NOT in that set AND with no carried occupant, or one holding the other kind of
object, still SKIPS as the plain guards did — every caller-supplied path is offered to both
the directory loop and the file loop and each takes its own kind, and requiring the whole
list would fail every spawn on a host that simply does not use one of those tools. A target
with a carried occupant is judged by it when the name is EMPTY as well: a pass recorded an
object at that name moments ago, so an absent name is that object moved, and the pin refuses
it as it already refuses a dangling link whose referent vanished. `~/.ssh` is the case that
forces this -- the strict tier records it and nothing else marks it required -- so its block
is entered on `lexists` OR a carried identity, and the pin refuses the absence. **The
requirement covers ABSENCE only, and that separation is load-bearing rather than tidy.**
Several established targets are regular files that also travel in the directory list, so a
requirement that refused the wrong-KIND miss too would have the directory loop kill the
launcher over a file the file loop masks correctly — on the ordinary first spawn against a
fresh data home, not under a race. Being established says the object is still there; it
says nothing about which loop is meant to mask it, so only the loops' own kind test may
answer that. `~/.ssh` follows the same split by a different route: its guard is `lexists`,
which sees an occupant of any kind, so the pin declining the name is read back against
the name itself. A name that has EMPTIED since the guard is a race and refuses; a name
still occupied by something that is not a directory (a dangling link, a link to a plain
file) holds no key directory to hide, and skips with a stderr warning rather than failing
every strict spawn on that host. `sandbox_level` remains the deliberate opt-out for a
host that cannot mount.

**Documented residual: the pin FOLLOWS symlinks, so a link planted at a protected leaf is
masked at its target while the link name stays replaceable (#13802).** `mount(2)` follows
symlinks in its target exactly as `O_PATH` does, so mounting by name and mounting a pinned
descriptor reach the same object here and this is inherited rather than introduced by the
pinning — measured by comparing both resolutions' device and inode against a planted decoy.
The name check does NOT cover it either: it re-resolves with a following `stat`, so a link
pointing at the stand-in satisfies its identity comparison. Read that check as closing a name
REPOINTED at another object, not a name that was a link from the start. Following is
deliberate, because the `isdir`/`isfile` guards it replaces followed links too and a symlinked
data home is supported. `_refuse_aliased_masked_leaves` refuses a link at every non-tolerated
hidden leaf, so what remains is the window between that `lstat` and the child's mount; closing
it needs an `O_NOFOLLOW` per-component descent inside the generated launcher, which cannot
reach the `pinned_fs` helpers.

**Documented residual: the write carve-out still resolves its name twice.** The
`extra_writable_dirs` pair (bind, then remount read-write) is the one mount left on the
by-name form. It WIDENS access inside an already-sealed subtree and degrades open by
design, so a lost race costs an MCP probe its writable temp directory rather than exposing a
credential, and its own `islink` refusal already rejects a link planted where the directory
belongs. Recorded here rather than left implied, and pinned by
`test_write_carveout_still_resolves_its_own_name_twice`.

**Scope: the Linux bind-mask path only.** The pass is called from `namespace_argv`, so it
governs the Linux namespace launcher. macOS fences the same leaves through Seatbelt subpath
denies, which are path rules rather than mounts and hold for a name that does not exist
yet, so whether a symlinked leaf there resolves outside the denied subpath is a separate
question this pass does not answer.

One exception is deliberate and has a test asserting it is NOT refused: a SYMLINKED `.env`,
the operator's hand-authored channel-credential file and the clearest dotfile-manager case
in the list.

The extra-hardlink shape is split per leaf rather than tolerated everywhere.
`sandbox._CREW_HARDLINK_REFUSED_LEAVES` REFUSES the spawn for the leaves whose bytes are a
usable secret off this host on their own — the token signing key, the refresh-token chain
state, the auth SQLite store with its WAL, SHM and journal sidecars, `.env`, the
md-notebook access token, the Mission Control secrets store, and the three browser session
leaves — and every other masked leaf keeps the WARNING, pinned per leaf so the boundary
fails a test rather than drifting. The split is weighing a cost that the refusing side
pays: `st_nlink` reports that a second name EXISTS and not where it is, so refusing also
refuses a link `rsync --link-dest` or a hardlinking snapshot tool left OUTSIDE the sandbox,
where it is harmless. For a credential leaf that is the right trade and the same one
`_refuse_unless_sole_regular_link` already makes for the live-target pointer, and it is not
left to arrive as a failed spawn — `sandbox.masked_credential_leaf_aliases()` reports the
condition in `kirocrew doctor` first, in the refusal's own words (see [cli](cli.md),
*Doctor Checks*). For a leaf masked only so an agent cannot WRITE it, its reader
re-validates the content and a host-wide spawn outage is not proportionate to a write
alias. `.env` sits on the refusing side even though its symlink is tolerated: that
tolerance exists for the layout a dotfile manager produces, and chezmoi and stow produce a
symlink or a copy, never a hard link. Only a REGULAR FILE can carry a second hard link —
`link(2)` refuses a directory — so every directory leaf is outside this decision by shape
rather than by judgement.

Nothing here is silent, and that is part of the decision rather than an accident: a
tolerated leaf is VISITED and logged, because excluding it from the walk would reproduce on
the credential leaf exactly the silence the pass exists to end. The warnings are emitted by
this pass rather than by `_warn_if_alias_backed`, which never runs over these leaves, and
they fire per spawn for that function's own stated reason -- a host where this keeps
happening has a real problem, and de-duplicating would hide how often the control cannot be
established. A third case degrades rather than refusing: a planted link at an intermediate
component of an md-notebook state leaf, where `carveout_chain_has_planted_link` already
withholds the carve-out, so the owning backend cannot write that state and an unmasked leaf
has nothing to expose; refusing there would let one optional app's on-disk layout stop every
sandboxed spawn on the host. That case warns too.

`scratch` and `backup` were checked for a supported second name and refuse: each resolves
to one managed path (`agent_scratch.scratch_root()` is `config_dir() / "scratch"`) with no
override, so a link there is not a relocation the product offers.

Masking a credential leaf as a FILE leaves its publish temp to account for separately,
because a mask covers a path and the temp has a different one. The gateway's two auth
stores — `token_signing.key` and `refresh_chains.json` — publish through
`auth-store-staging`, a direct child of the data home that is masked
(`sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES`), precreated so a sandbox spawned before the first write does
not watch the directory appear (`_CREW_PRECREATE_HIDDEN_DIR_LEAVES`), and fenced from the
agent file tools (`security.paths._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`) — all three as whole DIRECTORY
entries, so every temp name inside is covered without a per-name decision. Staged beside
the leaf instead, the temp sits in the data-home root, which is sandbox-visible and same-uid
writable, and it holds the full key or chain state for the whole write: an agent listing
that directory can `link(2)` it and keep reading after the publish rename. The hardlink pass
above cannot see that window, because it runs before a spawn and the window opens during
one. This is the same treatment, and the same reason, as `live-target-staging`,
`md-notebook-staging` and `aws-control-staging`. The staging directory is validated rather
than trusted on each publish: a symlink or non-directory is refused, and so is a group- or
world-WRITABLE directory whose mode `chmod` cannot narrow, because another local account
could otherwise replace the staged file between the payload write and the publish link and
install a signing key of its choosing. A directory that is merely group- or world-READABLE
is narrowed with `chmod` and warned about when that does not stick: a read bit leaks the
temps' names and grants no substitution, and it is the `dir_mode=0755` default of a real
mount class. Refusing costs no persisted key, because a caller whose retry budget the
refusal exhausts reaches its own in-place fallback.

A temp written before that directory existed is an artefact already on disk, which
masking forward cannot reach, so both launchers sweep
`.token_signing.key.*.tmp` from every crew-home spelling
(`sandbox._sweep_legacy_auth_store_temps`) and refuse the spawn if one cannot be removed.
A match is only removed once it is known not to be the key inode's last name: with the key
present at its own name and a different inode it is removed outright; sharing the key's inode
it gets `fsync_dir` on the root first, refusing where the device refuses that; and with the
key ABSENT nothing is removed and the spawn PROCEEDS with the temp retained and reported as
exposed, because that state cannot be told apart
from a staged write that never published, so removing risks destroying a key an operator can
still recover by renaming while leaving it would hand the agent a cleartext key. Refusing there
is the third option and it is the one not taken: the absent-key state is reachable in a crew home
the install does not use, which is masked by nothing while it is absent and therefore creatable
from inside a sandbox, so a refusal would let the governed process stop every launch on the host.
The `SECURITY:` warning names both recoveries on every spawn, `kirocrew doctor` lists the
condition, and the next start mints a fresh key after which this sweep removes the temp outright.
That sweep is bounded to names carrying the leaf, and the bound is load-bearing rather than
conservative: the data home is shared and `atomic_write` stages `tmp<random>.tmp` there for
unrelated stores, so a wider pattern would unlink another component's in-flight temp between
its `mkstemp` and its rename. A pre-upgrade `refresh_chains.json` temp carries that
leaf-less name and so cannot be told apart from a live one, so it is not swept. The
keystone-artifact suffix rule covers a `.tmp` or `.lock` name in a keystone leaf's own
directory, but it lives in `security.paths` and gates the agent's FILE TOOLS only: no OS
mask binds a `tmp<random>.tmp` name in the sandbox-visible data-home root, so a shell inside
the namespace can open one and read the consumed-JTI, revoked-chain and `chain_peers` state
it holds. That is a stated residual, not a closed hole. It affects only a home carrying a
temp from the earlier layout, nothing recreates one, and removing the file closes it.

Memory V2 separates members' learning and work context; it does not promise
confidentiality between agents running as the same host operator. One stable
`member_id` owns one stable `store_id`, whose managed path contains one SQLite
learning authority. Arbitrary code and external tools may read another member's
files. Prompts and built-in path checks guide correct use and prevent accidental
raw DB/WAL/SHM edits; they are not an adversarial file-isolation boundary.

The ordinary Linux and macOS sandboxes expose `memory_stores/` read-only while
leaving it readable. Built-in named-store mutations run in the gateway; sandboxed
agent code has no direct writer requirement. Linux may create only the empty
root to make the directory mount possible, never a database or member config.
This reuses the normal read-only mount/write-and-link denial, with no per-member
view, proof, hardlink scan or platform admission requirement. Existing named V1
root links retain their ordinary handling. The rule provides write integrity
where the host sandbox is active; sandbox-off execution, external host tools and
pre-existing writable aliases are not covered. Global V1 paths are unchanged.

Normal memory tools use the authenticated caller's canonical execution record.
The gateway captures it once per request and passes the same member/store/mode
to checks, execution and background work. Display labels, templates and projects
do not select a database. Missing member identity or an unavailable, corrupt or
mismatched database returns a specific error, never an empty replacement or a
silent Global V1 fallback. Only explicit member creation provisions a database.
Delegation inherits the member unless an explicit target member is admitted by
the ordinary delegation rules; continuation retains the original run member.

Member-specific namespace/Seatbelt views, hardlink scans, PID ancestry proofs,
HMAC capabilities and duplicate protected session/run grants are removed. Member
memory does not require a particular OS sandbox or direct MCP topology. Shared
MCP uses its ordinary authenticated, request-local caller metadata. Ordinary
signed PID sidecars and broker caller validation retain their transport duties.

Host sandboxing, credential masking, tool allow/deny decisions, HTTP/MCP
authentication, dashboard-owner and application permissions, SEL integrity and
mandatory enterprise governance remain independent controls. Explicit dashboard
`?store=` access still requires owner authorization. Internal calls cannot choose
arbitrary database paths or gain owner aggregate controls through a memory
binding. Local owner-token bootstrap still requires positive host provenance or
a live application backend owned by this gateway; an unknown peer is refused.
Linux namespace and macOS sandbox queries retained for that bootstrap are host
authorization checks, not member-memory isolation. On Linux, a CLI peer in a
different user or mount namespace is refused unless it is a live application
backend tracked by this gateway. A script cron child is such a peer, and so is
the `kirocrew token` it shells out to: `run_script_sandboxed` launches every
script cron through `wrap_argv`, so the child never shares the gateway's
namespaces. That refusal is kept deliberately rather than given a cron-registry
accept branch of the app-backend shape. A cron body is agent-writable, and an
owner token reaches the keystone writes under `/api/security`, `disable_all`
among them, so a live-cron exception would let an agent switch off its own
denied-command rules from a cron. Script crons drive the dashboard with their
own internal-secret credential instead: `ScriptContext.open_session` and its
siblings in [learn-cron-dashboard](learn-cron-dashboard.md). That secret is not
admitted to `/api/security` or `/api/governance`, and the internal branch sets no
`user` claim, so the owner gates refuse it. Pinned by
`test/test_script_cron_owner_bootstrap.py` and
`test/integration/test_script_cron_sessions.py`. This intentional owner-token
bootstrap restriction
also applies to installations with no members. Container, Snap and Flatpak CLI login across
namespaces is not claimed as verified.

Context assembly reads the member, manual rules, briefing, execution template and
project documents directly. It does not open SQLite to discover ownership.
Source validation, bounded reads and deduplication remain; globs skip managed
state, while an explicitly invalid source reports its error. Optional learned
context is omitted with an availability diagnostic if its database cannot open.
Delivery receipts belong to a specific session and provider incarnation, and are
committed only after successful delivery. A chat with native context cannot
switch member in place; unused-chat selection coordinates prewarming, resume
pointers and late provider results before binding the new execution.

Incognito allows memory reads but no session-induced learning writes; Temporary
allows neither, including automatic lessons. Recall has no persistent side
effects. Child, continuation, workflow and task records cannot loosen the mode.
Restricted payloads stay out of Crew checkpoints, progress files and extraction.
The shared MCP audit wrapper records tool, session and outcome for memory,
delegation, task, workflow, cron-write and hook-registration calls without their
query or body arguments, including validation and execution failures. Independent
authorization events and audit-chain integrity remain intact.
Retention mode is established before provider startup and recording. Crew's
native-session cleanup is a lifecycle operation; external providers' own storage
and crash behavior remain provider-specific, not a new sandbox guarantee.

[subagents](subagent.md) for storage, selection and retention details.

## Module layout

The security controls ship as the package `src/kiro_crew/security/`. `kiro_crew.security` remains the only import path for the split controls: `security/__init__.py` is a facade that re-exports every name the rest of the tree and the tests reach, so a caller never names a submodule. Submodules hold one responsibility cluster each, and the facade is what keeps that split an internal detail rather than an API. One module on this surface sits outside the facade by design: `readonly_bash.py`, the read-only bash classifier, is imported by its own path (`kiro_crew.security.readonly_bash`) and is not re-exported -- see its entry below for why.

Two mechanisms make "the split changed nothing for a caller" a tested claim rather than a remembered one, pinned by `test_security_facade.py` and `test_security_single_storage.py`:

- **A frozen export manifest** (`security/_exports.py`) lists every name the package exports, private helpers included. Each must resolve on the facade and be the SAME object the owning submodule holds — a re-export by identity, never a copy. The list is frozen rather than derived, because a derived list agrees with any facade; a name leaves it only when the symbol is deliberately deleted.
- **Re-export by resolution, so the value has one home.** The facade binds no re-exported name. `_EXPORTS` maps each name to the SHORT NAME of the submodule that defines it, `_owner()` resolves that submodule (`sys.modules` for a module already loaded, `importlib.import_module` for the miss), a module `__getattr__` reads the value off the owner on every access, and `_ReExportModule.__setattr__`/`__delattr__` send a write or delete there. So the value lives only in the owner's namespace and the owner only in `sys.modules`, which is what makes a patch, a replaced module and a purged-and-reimported module all visible at once, in one direction, with nothing to keep in sync. The facade's own code cannot use `__getattr__` — a function defined here resolves a bare global through this module's namespace, which never reaches it — so those functions ask `_submodule()` for the owner and read the name off it, once per scope. The earlier arrangement bound each name here AND mirrored a write to the owner: the mirror was one-way, so an owner-side patch stayed invisible to every reader that went through the facade.
- **The boundary: a name this package does not define is an ordinary attribute of it.** `_EXPORTS` covers only names a submodule of this package defines. A name the facade imports for its own use from the standard library or another `kiro_crew` package (`re`, `Path`, `SecurityEventLog`, `path_resolve_executor`) stays a plain attribute here, so a write to it lands here and reaches no submodule — a patch site for such a name names the module that READS it (`security.exfil`, `security.paths`), the same conversion a cross-submodule name has always needed.
- **An unresolvable owner denies rather than answers.** Resolution can fail where a binding could not, so the failure modes are kept distinct on purpose: a name in the table whose owner will not import raises `ImportError`, and only a name that does not exist raises `AttributeError`. `getattr(security, "is_sensitive_path", None)` swallows the second and lets the first through, so an unresolvable gate cannot become a `None` a caller reads as "not sensitive". `_submodule()` also reads `sys.modules` before importing so that a caller who rebinds `importlib.import_module` — which tests do, for unrelated reasons — cannot reroute a gate's read to their own object.

### Submodules

- `diagnostics.py` — what a refusal says about ITSELF: the refusal-diagnostic record, the character-class census behind it, and the one appender every tier uses. A refusal that names only a matcher cannot be acted on — the agent receiving it cannot tell which tier decided, cannot tell where in its own command the decision landed, and so cannot tell a true positive from a matcher firing on text position. Three properties make it safe to put in front of a model and in an audit record. It carries no payload bytes: the matched region is reported as offsets plus a character-class census, because a refusal is the one message guaranteed to concern content the policy judged sensitive, so echoing the match would make the explanation the leak. Its identifiers are closed: the rule id and the component name are screened against an identifier pattern and replaced by a placeholder otherwise, so the format is structurally incapable of quoting a command rather than merely careful not to. And its cost is bounded: the census reads a fixed maximum of the span while the reported length stays true, because the one tier that refuses WITHOUT scanning refuses precisely because its subject is too large to walk on the event loop. It imports nothing from the package, which is what lets both the keystone and the catalog tier reach it without an import-time cycle; it and `vocabulary.py` and `helpers.py` are peers at the bottom of the order.
- `vocabulary.py` — the bottom of the dependency order: the product's own name in the two spellings the matchers need, one that matches the name anywhere in a token and one that matches it only as a whole program name, plus the kill programs that select their target by name. Pure vocabulary — no predicate and no verdict, so nothing here can decide anything. It sits below the reader because two tiers read it and neither owns it: the reader consults it to work out what a computed word expands to, and the argv-structural floor above the reader matches the same name in command position. Holding the spellings here is what keeps that dependency one-way instead of the reader depending on the floor and the floor on the reader, an import-time cycle. It imports nothing from the package.
- `helpers.py` — the foundation: the public prompt-injection screen over the shared vocabulary, and the resource-limit policy reader with the `preexec_fn` builder it feeds (see [resource-protection.md](../../architecture/resource-protection.md)). It imports nothing from the package, which is what makes it the bottom of the dependency order and keeps the split acyclic. The resource limits sit here rather than with a matcher because they bound a *spawn*, not a path or a command.
- `shell_normalizer.py` — the shell text reader every tier that judges a command line goes through: statement and word splitting, the quote and escape state machine, redirection and substitution peeling, argv attribution, printer-escape decoding, the expansion shapes whose value cannot be known without running the line, and the top of the reader — the public path normalizer, the tokenizer and the quote-literal decoder behind it, the nested-payload extractor and the payload walk that descends through every literal wrapper, and the local-assignment resolver that substitutes a variable with a literal assigned on the same line, together with the per-line assignment-resolved views the gate re-scans and the argument-position rule that keeps an argument shaped like an assignment from being read as one. It also holds the word and shape layer that reads a native-shell line into words and each word into a path shape and the change-directory vocabulary. It decides nothing, and imports only `vocabulary.py`, the layer below — the tiers depend on the reader, never the reverse. The reader deliberately **over**-approximates: one that under-approximates blinds every tier at once, and no OS sandbox sees shell text. Narrowing therefore belongs at the site that decides, never here. The whole-program recognizer and the mint-verb predicate sit here rather than with the argv floor that also reads them: each is a thin test over this module's own basename and operand readers, so a module below the reader cannot hold either without taking those readers down with it, and placing either in the floor would make the reader depend on the floor and the floor on the reader, an import-time cycle. They recognize a word rather than decide anything about it. The name spellings they match are one layer further down, in `vocabulary.py`.
- `paths.py` — the keystone sensitive-path declarations, bounded resolver,
  read/write path gates, and the command-line orchestrator. The command-line gate
  deliberately matches no paths; it enforces only the scan-size ceiling, IMDS
  access, and environment-credential exfiltration. Layer-one path declarations
  stay importable below the egress and rule-catalog modules; the orchestrator
  reaches those upper layers through call-time imports to avoid a cycle. The
  resolver is bounded because a path check runs synchronously on the event loop
  against an agent-supplied token, and a stall fails **closed** for every path
  under the stalled prefix until the mount answers again. The refusal a stall produces is worded as what it is: `sensitive_path_refusal` is the path tier's reason-or-`None` producer (the shape the bash, exfiltration and deny-rule tiers already have), `is_sensitive_path` is its `is not None`, and a stall answers "could not be verified against the sensitive-path list ... NOT a match ... retry the same call" where a match answers `access to sensitive path`. The decision is identical either way; only the words differ, because a stall reported as a match sends the agent reading it after a credential in an ordinary project file, or to a re-spelling that meets the same budget. `deny_guidance` classifies that refusal FIRST and structurally -- `is_unverifiable_path_refusal`, a test of the fixed prefix the producer exports, which precedes any caller-influenced text -- never by searching the text, because both refusals quote the agent's path verbatim and a path spelled to contain the stall wording would otherwise move a real match into the wait-and-retry class (and past `safe_read_file`'s repr re-spelling, the log-forgery guard). Its remediation is "wait, retry the identical call" rather than any credential remedy. Because that blanket refusal is the expensive conclusion, two things bound what earns it. A missed budget is not itself a stall: the resolution gets a bounded grace — a capped fraction of the caller's own budget — to finish, and one that finishes is a success that charges nothing, which is the only discriminator available on hosts where the syscall probe cannot say WHY the budget was missed (every Windows host, since `platform.machine()` reports a name absent from the syscall table). And the prefix a stall is charged to splits the DRIVE off before counting components, so a Windows path keys on `C:\Users\<user>` rather than collapsing to `C:\Users` — a key that contains `$HOME`, `%TEMP%`, the workspace and the checkout, and so turned one slow resolution into a refusal of essentially the whole host. Each budget is also sized to the work its caller submits: the anchor REBUILD is one job doing ~130 `realpath` calls and carries its own, larger budget, where a candidate resolution does one or two. Across all prefixes and anchor jobs, each calling thread shares a 12-second cumulative allowance for actual result waits, including successful waits, timeouts and grace, but excluding a wait below a 100ms floor: that floor is resolver-pool round-trip overhead rather than filesystem latency, and without it ordinary bulk work (a project-tree listing, a knowledge-indexing pass, a directory-wide scan) accumulates thousands of sub-millisecond on-time waits and exhausts the allowance with zero mount evidence. Both waits are clamped to the remaining allowance; exhaustion refuses without submitting or charging a prefix. A timeout whose budget or grace was clamped short by the allowance also refuses without charging a prefix, since it establishes nothing about the mount; only a timeout that received its full entitled budget and full entitled grace can charge the prefix. Spend expires only after 25 seconds without a positive-duration resolver wait, so adjacent windows cannot combine into the 25-second watchdog gap. This deliberately fails closed for otherwise healthy paths when their thread has spent its allowance, leaving 13 seconds for heartbeat age and other tool-call work. Background callers cannot consume the loop thread's allowance, and bookkeeping cleanup removes only expired thread entries.
- `denied_rules.py` — the configurable tier: the built-in denied-command catalog, the reverse pattern-to-id map, the two governance pin accessors that read it through the legacy-spelling alias map, the effective-list resolver, the inert-search-verb exception surface with its fail-closed eligibility gate, the linear matcher, and the single producer of refusal text. Four things here are load bearing beyond their own tier. The floor tag sets and pattern tables are tied to catalog rule ids so the matcher and display rows cannot drift; the single ungated git-publish id is exposed explicitly by `floor_enforced_builtin_command_ids()`. The pin accessors sit with the reverse map because a pin is a pattern STRING a policy persisted, and only that map turns it back into a rule id; they stay two accessors rather than one, because the enforcement side resolves the ACTIVE ceiling alone while the display side over-locks across every loaded profile, and unioning at the enforcement side would force one profile's pin onto every other. The matcher is an evaluation-layer rewrite only — the rule patterns were authored for a linear-time engine and are not safe to hand to a backtracking one verbatim, so the catalog rows and the golden fixture the parity test pins to stay byte-for-byte unchanged and a refusal still reports the original pattern. The refusal producer's first line is frozen because two consumers parse it, one with a per-line end-anchored regex, so an operator note goes on a second line that both ignore. It imports the shell reader only. The environment credential tier sits here too, and for a structural reason rather than by subject: it re-enforces two catalog rows and resolves their ids to row objects in a module-level comprehension, eagerly so an unresolvable id fails at import rather than silently retiring an always-on block, which makes it catalog-side by construction. The evaluator and the audit emitters still sit in the facade: the evaluator reads the argv floor's predicates, and the floor reads one sentinel this module owns, so the evaluator cannot land here without making that pair a load-time cycle — its home is a layer ABOVE the floor, or the sentinel moves down to `vocabulary.py` first.
- `redaction.py` — the output side, and the widest external surface in the package: the credential alternation with the pre-filter that gates it, the entropy machinery behind them, the redaction tag registry, the batch credential redactor and the host-path pass. The alternation and the pre-filter are ONE unit and are never separated, because the redactor SKIPS the alternation entirely when the pre-filter returns False — an input the alternation would have matched but the pre-filter rejects is a silent leak rather than a missed optimisation, so the pre-filter is a documented strict superset asserted by test. The entropy machinery answers a different question from the alternation: a bare high-entropy run carries no marker to anchor on, so it is judged by shape — length, character classes, entropy, decodability — with each gate a separate predicate so a refusal can name the one that fired. It imports nothing from the package. The streaming redactor, the combined `redact()` pass and the scan-then-truncate wrapper still sit in the facade, because each composes this module with the exfiltration-URL redactor in `exfil.py`, the layer ABOVE it: a composition over both sides belongs above the egress split, not inside either half of it. The one path-aware form, `redact_path_segments(path, redactor=None)`, does live here and takes the whole-string redactor as a parameter for that same layering reason: the egress call sites (the project tree and git-status listings in `dashboard/file_api/project_tree.py` and `dashboard/file_api/git_panel.py`, and the content-search rows in `dashboard/file_api/grep.py`) pass the context-aware `redact` shim, so a loaded companion's extra patterns apply, and the default is the credential pass alone. It redacts a `/`-separated path segment by segment and suffixes every segment the redactor changes with `~` and an opaque label: `HMAC-SHA256(_PATH_LABEL_KEY, segment)` truncated to 12 hex digits, where `_PATH_LABEL_KEY` is 32 random bytes generated once per gateway process (`secrets.token_bytes`), held only in memory and never persisted, logged or exposed. It never emits LESS redaction than the redactor it wraps: the segment-wise result is returned only when the redactor finds nothing left in it (a token spanning a separator is matched by no single segment), otherwise the whole-string result is returned unchanged; a path the redactor leaves alone is returned as is. Each call site calls it per path. The keyed per-process label is the one shape that satisfies all five properties those listings need at once: (1) distinct inputs stay distinct, so two genuinely different paths whose only differing segment is credential-shaped (two `AKIA…` filenames, two hash-named build-asset directories) stay two entries instead of collapsing to one placeholder that a de-duplicating listing then silently drops; (2) no byte of the secret is in the output, the tag replaces the token whole; (3) no UNKEYED digest of the secret, because a plain hash prefix hands a reader an offline dictionary oracle over a low-entropy token and the HMAC cannot be checked without the key; (4) no dependence on listing position or order, because the label is a function of the segment alone, so a sorted listing does not correlate it with the secret's lexicographic rank and a path labels the same way whatever else is listed with it; (5) stable across responses within one gateway process, because the dashboard (`PierreWorkspaceTreeImpl.tsx`) joins the tree response with the git-status response by path, and a per-response label breaks that join whenever only one of two colliding paths appears in the status response. The label changes when the gateway restarts, which is fine: both responses of one join come from the same process. The listings keep their post-redaction de-dup behind it as the fallback for a collision the helper does not separate (48 bits make an accidental one negligible within a tree). One masker sits here for the BINARY delivery scans alone, `mask_baseline_symbol_tables`. A standard baseline JPEG's Huffman symbol table has a 45-character printable tail that reads as six digits, a colon and thirty-two letters — an unlabelled bot token — so without it `platform/context.py`'s `binary_content_is_flagged` refuses essentially every image written with the default tables, including a blank 694-byte one. Masking is pinned to that ONE fixed constant, held as code-point ranges rather than a pasted literal because the literal is itself the credential shape, and fires only on a whole maximal region of text bytes EQUAL to a contiguous slice of it. That equality is the entire safety argument and it needs no reasoning about shapes: the only characters the masker can remove are characters of a public constant, so no uploader-chosen byte is removable, a credential-shaped run that merely resembles a table keeps its whole match, and a credential written beside a table shares the table's region and leaves it unmaskable. The region floor is the shortest slice any detector here flags — measured, not chosen — and the number of masked regions is capped, past which the buffer is returned untouched, which is the REFUSING direction. Safety needs two bounds, not one. What may be REMOVED is bounded by that equality. What the removal may BREAK is the half a slice rule alone does not cover, because a match can depend on the region without lying inside it, in two ways. It can ANCHOR ACROSS the region -- the non-text bytes delimiting it sit inside the value classes carrying no literal label -- and it can BORROW a required literal FROM the region, since the constant contains punctuation including `:`, which is exactly the separator `://[^\s:/@]*:[^\s/]+@` requires. So removing only PUBLIC characters can still destroy a match. Both are closed in `_mask_region`: only the region's ALPHANUMERICS are filled and its punctuation is copied through, so every literal the region could lend survives; and the filler is `~`, admitted by every boundary-crossing class (`[^\s/]`, `[^\s"',}]`, `[^\s:/@]`, `[\s\S]`) so a crossing run survives, and by no contiguous-token class (`[A-Za-z0-9+/]`, `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, `[0-9]`) so a token run can only shorten. The split is on alphanumeric because that is what the unlabelled credential SHAPES are made of, so filling them cancels the table's bot-token shape while the punctuation the patterns need as literals stays -- a whitespace filler destroys a password spanning a table, and filling the whole region destroys one that borrows the table's colon. The text path deliberately does not use it: there a match costs a redaction tag, where on the delivery path it costs the file and the only way past the refusal is a durable class-wide grant; `test_outbox_binary.py` pins it. Pinned by `test_redact_path_segments.py`, `test_project_tree.py` and `test_project_git_status_log.py`.
- `exfil.py` — credential EGRESS, the layer above output redaction: the URL and token layer that decides whether a URL carries a credential in its path or query, the safe-diagnostic family that reports such a finding as a rule id, a component and a character-class shape rather than the bytes it matched, the operator-extensible OAuth authorization-endpoint set, the data-egress and reverse-shell command gate, the metadata-address folder that collapses every alternate encoding of the instance metadata endpoint onto one dotted quad, and the metadata check built on it. It imports `redaction.py` and nothing else in the package, and that direction is the design rather than an accident: redaction decides whether a run of text IS a credential, this module decides whether a command or a URL is carrying one OUT, so the egress side reads redaction's shape predicates and redaction reads nothing here. The environment tier that re-enforces two catalog rows lives in `denied_rules.py` instead, because it resolves those rule ids to row objects at import time — a dependency on the catalog rather than on anything here, and eager so an unresolvable id fails at import instead of silently retiring an always-on block. The endpoint sanitizer is redaction's by responsibility but still sits in the facade: it consults this module's egress pattern set, so placing it in `redaction.py` would point the load-time edge back the wrong way, and those patterns move down a layer first.
- `inline_payload.py` — static mint-name checks for inline Python payloads selected
  by the argv floor. It folds constant string expressions, resolves supported call
  bindings with Python tokenization and AST parsing, decodes supported base64
  literals, and asks whether the payload names a Kiro Crew credential-mint surface.
  It is a heuristic, never an interpreter or the OS credential boundary.
- `argv_floor.py` — the always-on argv-structural floor. It owns three families:
  protected or ambiguous git-publish detection; Kiro Crew termination, restart,
  update, and destructive-cloud subcommands; and credential-mint predicates that
  follow inline programs, here-documents, stdin redirections, and nested shells.
  Governance-home path writes are intentionally outside this module and are
  enforced by the OS sandbox. Structure is the point: the product name in a path,
  search pattern, or commit message is not itself a verdict.
- `readonly_bash.py` — the read-only bash classifier: `is_read_only_bash` / `unsafe_bash_reason`, the last gate before a shell command auto-approves with no human prompt under `--approval reads` / trust-reads and in `hooks.on_tool_call`'s read-only branch, together with every table that verdict rests on -- the prefix allowlist, the per-verb write, exec and indirection flag denylists, the git ref and remote subcommand rules, the positive option accept-lists for the four tools whose surface is small enough to enumerate (`sort`, `date`, `file`, `hostname`), and the shell-expansion readers that decide whether a token's real spelling is knowable before it runs. Deny-by-default: a command has to be RECOGNISED as read-only, so a spelling nobody thought of prompts rather than passes, and every table entry carries the measurement that put it there. It imports nothing from the package and nothing from the dashboard, which is what lets `hooks.py` import it at module top; its two consumers are `dashboard/chat_runner.py` (the approval flow, where the reason text becomes the refusal card) and `hooks.py` (the auto-approve branch). It is NOT a facade submodule and is reached by its own path, for two reasons. It is not a piece of the split: the classifier came here from `dashboard/state.py`, where no caller or patch site ever reached it as `kiro_crew.security.<name>`, so the facade has nothing to preserve for it and adding its private tables to the frozen manifest would widen the facade's API for no caller. And it answers a different question from the tiers the facade fronts: those decide whether a command is DENIED, and `hooks.on_tool_call` runs every one of them before it asks this module whether the survivor is read-only enough to skip the prompt -- a verdict layer above the deny tiers, not one of them, so it does not belong in a dependency order whose top is the argv floor. Pinned by `test_trust_reads.py`.

## Threat Model

| Threat | Vector | Mitigation |
|--------|--------|------------|
| XPIA credential theft | LLM reads `~/.aws`, `~/.ssh` via `fs_read` or `cat` | File tools are blocked by `is_sensitive_path()`. Shell access is bounded by the selected OS-sandbox tier: strict mode hides these stores, while standard mode intentionally leaves them visible for credential tooling; output redaction remains defense in depth |
| XPIA data exfiltration | LLM embeds secrets in URLs posted to a chat channel or the dashboard | Output scanning + URL redaction |
| Cross-origin WebSocket hijack | Malicious page connects to `ws://127.0.0.1:5476/api/ws` | Origin header validation |
| Cross-origin mutation (CSRF) | Malicious page POSTs to dashboard API | Origin/Referer validation on non-safe methods |
| DNS rebinding | Attacker domain resolves to `127.0.0.1`; browser sends forged `Host` to the loopback-bound dashboard (incl. GET exfil) | `Host`-header allowlist validation on every method (`check_host` / `host_validation_middleware`), deny-by-default, 403 + SEL audit. Sole exemption: the three `PROBE_PATHS` liveness probes (orchestrators address containers by IP); their handlers strip identity fields via a second `check_host` gate, leaking nothing beyond TCP reachability |
| Unauthenticated remote access | Dashboard bound to `0.0.0.0` | Loopback-only by default (`127.0.0.1`); when user opts in via `dashboard.url`, token auth middleware requires HMAC-SHA256 signed, IP-pinned, single-use tokens on every request |
| Unauthenticated remote access (AEA tunnel) | `tunnel.enabled` exposes dashboard via public HTTPS URL | Double auth: Tunnels validates Midway OIDC at edge + Kiro Crew token auth middleware. Security gate refuses tunnel start without token auth active. Owner-only access (Tunnels restricts by username). SEL audit on connect/disconnect/denial |
| Published surface on a throwaway instance | A scratch instance (Dev Fleet pod) boots a gateway that can publish a tunnel, becoming reachable off the host and contending with a real gateway's registration. A seeded `tunnel.enabled=False` does not hold: it is written once at HOME creation and anything composing config later can flip it back | `--no-tunnel` boot flag pins "never publish" for the life of the process (`tunnel.set_publish_disabled`, read via `publish_disabled()`), consulted by BOTH doors out — `setup_tunnel` at boot, ahead of the token-auth gate and before any `TunnelManager` is constructed, and the on-demand provisioning in `slack.allowlist`, which bypasses `setup_tunnel` entirely. Config is deliberately not consulted: the flag is process state, so no file — including a `config.local.json` overlay — can turn it back on. A pod passes the flag on every exec whose target checkout declares it; the control plane builds the argv but the target worktree's gateway executes it, so `target_supports_flag` probes that checkout first and DROPS the flag when absent, because handing it to a gateway that predates it exits argparse 2 and `Restart=on-failure`/`RestartSec=5` (no `RestartPreventExitStatus`) makes that a 5s restart loop. SCOPE: such a checkout does NOT receive this guarantee — it keeps its pre-flag tunnel behaviour, which is a non-regression rather than a fix, and no config-side substitute is attempted. Re-pinning `tunnel.enabled=False` in the pod config was tried and withdrawn: `KiroCrewConfig.load()` deep-merges `config.local.json` OVER `config.json` with the overlay winning and `config set` writes the overlay by default, so pinning one file does not pin the setting; and the gateway's enable test is an OR (`cfg.tunnel.enabled or current_context().tunnel.enabled()`) whose provider half no config file reaches. Pinning `KIROCREW_PROFILE=standalone` to reach that half is also refused — the profile selects the whole `PlatformContext` including the Level-1 governance ceiling, so it would skip an administrator's policy.

## Modules

### Encrypted Secret Vault (`secrets/vault.py`)

Stores MCP-server credentials encrypted on disk under `.vault` in the data
home, keeping them out of the versioned `~/.kiro/mcp.json`. A `secret://NAME`
reference in a server's `env` block is resolved to the real value by
`mcp_gateway/secret_uri.py` **only at spawn time**, injected into that server's
process environment alone — never the agent's. A reference to a missing name
fails the server's spawn rather than launching it with an absent credential.

Security properties:

- **Write-only surface.** The vault is stored (`POST /api/secrets`), listed by
  name (`GET /api/secrets` — names only, values never returned) and deleted
  (`DELETE /api/secrets/{name}`) from the dashboard **Settings → Secrets** tab,
  all behind `_owner_only`. There is deliberately **no** read-back path, on the
  CLI or the API — a stored value cannot be retrieved, only replaced or
  deleted, so a prompt-injected agent has no oracle to exfiltrate it through.
- **Sandbox-hidden.** The `.vault` directory sits under the crew data home,
  which the OS-level sandbox bind-mounts away from the agent subprocess tree,
  so the agent cannot read the ciphertext off disk either.
- **`.env` migration.** `kirocrew secrets import [--apply]` moves the
  vault-aware Jira credential keys (`JIRA_API_TOKEN`, per-host
  `JIRA_TOKEN_<HEX>`) out of the data-home `.env` and rewrites each line to a
  `secret://KEY` reference; it reads only the data-home `.env` (no `--file`
  option) so it cannot be pointed at an attacker-controlled file. See
  [secrets-env.md](../../guides/secrets-env.md) and
  [cli.md](cli.md#secrets-command).

### OS-Level Sandbox (`sandbox.py`)

`kiro_crew.sandbox` is the import and patch surface. The two programs it writes out
are generated by their own owners: `sandbox_launcher._build_launcher_script` renders
the Linux namespace launcher and `sandbox_seatbelt._build_seatbelt_profile` the macOS
Seatbelt profile. `sandbox_mount_sweep` reclaims the launcher's stale bind-mount
sources for `cleanup_stale_sandbox_profiles`. Choosing a spawn's tier and backend,
materializing its mask targets, writing the program and building its argv
(`namespace_argv`, `sandbox_exec_argv`) stay in `sandbox.py`. The builders read the
plan they render (the tier lists, the leaf tables, the target helpers) from
`kiro_crew.sandbox` at call time. Every moved name is forwarded, so reading or
patching `kiro_crew.sandbox.<name>` reaches its owner.
`test/test_sandbox_refactor_generated_programs.py` pins both programs byte for byte.

Hides credential paths from kiro-cli subprocess tree using platform-native isolation:

- **Linux**: user + mount namespace — `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` → identity UID/GID map → `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)` → private propagation on `/` → bind-mount empty dirs. Availability is decided **empirically** by `_probe_unshare_once()`, which performs this **exact split sequence** up to and including the propagation mount rather than a combined `unshare(NEWUSER|NEWNS)` — see "Linux capability probe mirrors the split sequence" below for why the combined form gives a false positive, and why stopping at the unshares gave another.
- **macOS**: `sandbox-exec` with Seatbelt profile denying file reads. Backend availability is decided **empirically** by `_probe_sandbox_exec()` (write an `(allow default)` profile, run `sandbox-exec -f <profile>` against a trusted fixed system binary — `/usr/bin/true`, never the user-writable kiro-cli — and require exit 0) — there is **no hard-coded OS-version cutoff**. macOS 26 (Tahoe) is fully supported: Seatbelt is the same kernel subsystem backing App Sandbox/iOS/Chromium and was not removed; an earlier `major >= 26 → return False` gate wrongly disabled a working sandbox and was removed (verified the real profile compiles, runs a sandboxed process, and enforces credential-path denies on macOS 26.5). The `(allow default)` + targeted-deny profile also sidesteps the `(deny default)` sysctl-allowlist pitfall that caused the false "sandbox broken on macOS 26" reports.

#### Sandbox Modes

| Mode | Config value | Hides | Accessible | Env scrub |
|------|-------------|-------|------------|-----------|
| **Standard** | `"auto"` (default) | `.gnupg`, `.gpg`, `.config/gcloud`, `.azure`, `.docker` | `.aws`, `.ssh`, `.kube` | `AWS_SECRET*`, `AWS_SESSION*`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `GNUPGHOME`, `GIT_ASKPASS` (†) |
| **Strict** | `"strict"` | All of the above + `.aws`, `.ssh`, `.kube` | Only `~/.ssh/known_hosts` | Same as standard (†) |
| **Off** | `"off"` | Nothing | Everything | Nothing |

(†) `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is kept, not scrubbed, when the operator has granted the ssh-agent forward consent on the keystone (`ssh_auth_sock_consent.json`) — see the opt-in paragraph below.

**Standard mode** (new default) enables git-over-SSH, AWS CLI via `credential_process`, and kubectl while maintaining OS-level isolation on non-workflow credential stores. Env vars are scrubbed in ALL modes — `credential_process` reads from `~/.aws/config`, not env vars.

**`SSH_AUTH_SOCK` forward opt-in (keystone consent `ssh_auth_sock_consent.json`, default OFF, issue #8104)** — with a passphrase-protected SSH signing key, git commit signing inside the sandbox fails because the only path to the key is the operator's ssh-agent, reached through `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, which the scrub above removes. When the operator grants consent, the single `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` key is kept in the agent subprocess environment; every other credential prefix is still scrubbed, so the opt-in cannot widen into a general env passthrough. The property that makes this acceptable is that **the socket grants USE of the agent's keys, not possession**: the private key material is never forwarded, and under the **strict** tier `~/.ssh` is hidden (Linux bind-mount) / read-denied (macOS Seatbelt `(deny file-read* ~/.ssh)`, exempting only `known_hosts`), so the agent still cannot read the key files even with the socket. The trade-off is real: any code the agent runs can authenticate as the operator through the socket for the session's lifetime, not commit signing alone — which is why it is off by default and operator-declared. **Where the consent lives, and why not `config.json`:** because keeping the socket is an *authorization* (session-long USE of the operator's keys), not a preference, the enable is stored on the KEYSTONE leaf `ssh_auth_sock_consent.json` — the same placement and reasoning as `computer_use.json`, `aws_service_consent.json` and `file_delivery_consent.json`. It is on `security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` (agent file tools refuse it) AND `sandbox._CREW_READONLY_LEAVES` (the OS sandbox mounts it read-only for the agent's shell), so a prompt-injected agent shell cannot flip its own forwarding on and have the next subagent spawn authenticate as the operator. There is deliberately no `agent.*` config field (that would be agent-writable, the exact hole this closes) and no CLI verb; like `oauth_endpoints.json`, the operator writes the leaf (`{"enabled": true}`) out-of-band, from outside the sandbox. `ssh_auth_sock_consent` is read-only in code (`is_granted`); `_forward_ssh_auth_sock` reads it and fails closed to False on an absent, empty, unreadable, or non-`enabled: true` store. One filter (`sandbox._agent_scrub_prefixes`) applies the opt-in at the two OS-launcher scrub sites (the Linux namespace launcher and the macOS Seatbelt `env -u` renderer); the parent-side agent scrub applies it in `scrub_agent_subprocess_env` (the ACP enforcement point) rather than in the generic `scrub_env`, which also serves non-agent callers (tailscale host children, `sandboxed_spawn_argv` spawns) that must keep the socket scrubbed. The forward decision is a boolean resolved ONCE off the event loop on the agent spawn path (`_forward_ssh_auth_sock`, called inside the existing off-loop environment-prep hop in `AcpClient._spawn` / `AcpRuntime.spawn`) and threaded down as an explicit parameter -- exactly like `strip_python_env` -- so no synchronous keystone read runs on the asyncio event loop, and the generic launcher builders default the flag off. The forward's blast radius is therefore exactly the agent child: a third-party app `openCommand` or `sandboxed_spawn_argv` spawn going through the same generic launcher never re-admits the socket. The shared `_SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES` constant is **never** mutated by the opt-in, so MCP declared-env forwarding (`manager.is_credential_env_key`, below) keeps refusing `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` regardless of this consent.

**Pooled-backend declared-env forwarding (`mcp_gateway.forward_declared_env`, default ON)** — an agent spec may declare `mcpServers.<name>.env`. Under pooling one backend serves many sessions, so the rewriter expands any `${VAR}`/`${env:VAR}` placeholder the block declares — kiro-cli cannot, because the broker spawns the stub rather than the server — writes the resolved block to a `0600` sidecar, and the stub folds it into the `effective_env_hash` PoolKey dimension. Resolving once at write time keeps that sidecar the single source both the stub's hash and `gatewayd`'s coherence re-check read; an unresolved reference is left as a literal `${VAR}`, matching kiro-cli's expander. Placeholders dereference a **filtered view** of the gateway environment, not the raw one: names matching `is_secret_env_key`, `is_credential_env_key`, or the channel-credential scrub (`scrub_agent_denied_env`) are misses. Agent specs are agent-writable, so without that filter `{"TOKEN": "${env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}"}` would smuggle a credential *value* past the key-name filters below — the dereference view mirrors them, so a value the forwarder would refuse under its own name cannot ride in under another (and channel tokens, which the ACP spawn scrub hides from kiro-cli's own expander, are equally invisible here). With the flag ON, `gatewayd` reads the sidecar at **cold spawn only** and applies the surviving keys, filtered twice:

1. `hashing.non_secret_env` drops `ENV_SCRUB_PREFIXES` (`AWS_SECRET*`, `AWS_SESSION*`, `OAUTH*`). These are excluded from `effective_env_hash` **by design** so a credential rotation does not split the pool — which makes the hash non-injective over them, so two sessions with *different* secret values share one backend and no single value is correct to apply.
2. `manager.is_credential_env_key` drops every `_SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES` match (the broader list above, adding `AWS_ACCESS*`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `GNUPGHOME`, `GIT_ASKPASS`), so forwarding can never re-introduce a credential key that `_scrub_sensitive_env` deliberately removed from the daemon environment.

**Per-variable opt-in (`mcp_gateway.pool_identity_env`, default empty)** — an operator may name variables whose value IS part of a shared backend's identity. A named variable survives filter (1) *because* it is folded into `effective_env_hash`: the hash becomes injective over it, two sessions declaring different values get different backends, and "no single value is correct" stops being true for that key — so forwarding it is safe by the same argument that already licenses every other hashed key. It does not lift filter (2); `rewriter.pool_identity_env_keys` drops credential-scrub names at the source so a name can never sit in the identity while the forwarder still refuses it. The cost is the one the exclusion was avoiding: rotating a named value re-partitions that server's pool, so the next session cold-starts a backend. Naming nothing computes byte-identical hashes to before the setting existed, so no existing `PoolKey` is invalidated on upgrade. Because it selects the rewrite's output it is part of the rewrite fingerprint. **The stub's copy carries no authority**: the resolved names are passed on stub argv (names only — values stay in the `0600` sidecar) purely so the stub can compute the same hash, and `gatewayd` recomputes under the operator's own configured set, so a stub claiming a wider set produces a hash the daemon does not reproduce and the coherence gate below forwards nothing. Widening what may reach a shared backend therefore stays an operator decision, enforced by the gate that already existed rather than by a new check.

The forwarded set is therefore a **strict subset** of the hashed set — including under the opt-in, which widens both together and so can never widen one alone. Forwarding additionally **verifies coherence at spawn time**: `gatewayd` recomputes `hashing.hash_effective_env` over the sidecar it just read and forwards only when it equals the backend's `PoolKey.effective_env_hash`, skipping forwarding entirely on mismatch. That check is what makes "every forwarded key is part of the PoolKey, so all co-tenants of that backend declared the same value" true rather than merely intended — the stub hashes the sidecar when its session starts, but `gatewayd` re-reads it at cold spawn, so an operator editing `mcpServers.<name>.env` mid-session (with a running stub still holding the old PoolKey, e.g. across an adopted-daemon restart) would otherwise let a crash/idle-reap respawn apply the NEW values under the OLD key. Secret-bearing servers are unaffected: they read credentials from disk (the platform credential helper / the provider's default credential chain, protected per-session by the sandbox bind-mounts), name the variable via `mcp_gateway.pool_identity_env`, or stay unstubbed. The flag fails **closed** — an unreadable config, missing sidecar, malformed sidecar, or hash mismatch all forward nothing.

The flag also gates pooling eligibility at **rewrite time**: with forwarding OFF, an opted-in server that declares a non-empty `env` is left **unwrapped** (no stub) rather than pooled — a shared backend spawned without the env it declares dies at prime on every session, trips the circuit breaker, and degrades through a per-session fallback exec anyway (issue #3495 measured this as a permanent crash-loop for every env-declaring opted-in server). That coupling is why the default is ON: with it OFF, declaring a single ordinary key such as `LOG_LEVEL` forfeits pooling for the whole server, on the strength of a co-tenant disagreement the spawn-time hash check has already ruled out. Turning it off remains the escape hatch for a server that genuinely must not share a backend. The rewriter warns naming the knob; the session launches the server directly with its declared env applied, exactly as if it were not opted in. Because the flag selects the rewrite's OUTPUT, it is part of the rewrite fingerprint — flipping it regenerates the overlays. A declared value carrying a `${VAR}` reference selects the output too, but through the environment rather than a config file, and the environment is not a fingerprinted input: a pass that resolved one is therefore not cached at all and re-resolves on every boot, so a rotated credential cannot keep flowing its old value while no file changes. A placeholder-free spec is unaffected and still served from cache. Similarly, an opted-in server whose bare `command` cannot be resolved on the gateway's search path (the spec `env.PATH`, then the contributed MCP directories, then the host `PATH` augmented by `env.augmented_path` — the same resolution the MCP probe uses) is left unwrapped instead of being stubbed into a guaranteed-ENOENT pooled spawn: that same absence ENOENTs on every pooled spawn, while kiro-cli's own spawn environment may still resolve the command, so the session launches it directly rather than degrading through a pooled-spawn-then-fallback cycle every session.

**Conditional Python-interpreter env strip** — `PYTHONPATH`, `PYTHONHOME`, and `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX` (`_PYTHON_ENV_PREFIXES`) are stripped from official Kiro/ACP child environments by the parent-side `scrub_agent_subprocess_env()` in `AcpClient._spawn()` and `AcpRuntime.spawn()`. The POSIX wrappers also receive `strip_python_env=True`; `/api/models`, `whoami`, and `/usage` apply the same parent helper. Parent enforcement is mandatory on Windows because Kiro's built-in-sandbox delegation returns the raw argv and Windows has no POSIX `env -u` launcher. It also removes `_SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES` and `_AGENT_DENIED_ENV_KEYS`, making wrapped and delegated Kiro spawns inherit one policy. They are deliberately **excluded** from `_SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES` so Kiro Crew's OWN sandboxed Python children (cron scripts, app backends, code-review workers) keep them: they `import kiro_crew` via `PYTHONPATH`, and on the packaged app they must keep writing bytecode outside the signed bundle via `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX`. Rationale per key: Kiro Crew exports `PYTHONPATH` at its own site-packages, and a foreign MCP server bundling its own interpreter/deps would otherwise prepend Kiro Crew's site-packages to `sys.path` and load Kiro Crew's fastmcp/cryptography instead of its own — an ABI collision / init hang. At its pooled-backend boundary, `mcp_gateway/daemon/launch.py` applies the complete `PYTHON*` namespace strip only to `CONTROL_PLANE_BACKENDS`. The reserved control-plane token fence rejects any non-empty `PYTHON*` key that appears after that scrub, such as a hand-declared overlay. This prefix rule covers `PYTHONUSERBASE`, `PYTHONSTARTUP`, `PYTHONEXECUTABLE`, and variables added by later Python releases without guessing whether a value is inert. Removing `PYTHONUSERBASE` relocates per-user site-packages rather than disabling it, so the token fence also inspects that directory for a foreign `kiro_crew`; a `--user` install keeps its token because the package it finds there is the one the gateway is running. Third-party pooled backends never receive that token and keep operator Python settings outside the four keys in `_PYTHON_ENV_PREFIXES`; `PYTHONUNBUFFERED` is one such setting. `_PYTHON_ENV_PREFIXES` keeps its narrower membership because Kiro Crew's sandboxed Python subprocesses and packaged interpreter depend on those variables. The complete namespace removal is of the control plane's INHERITED environment, and the token verdict is taken on that environment; after the verdict the spawn site re-applies Kiro Crew's own UTF-8 pinning (`platform_compat._UTF8_PROCESS_ENV`, the same `PYTHONUTF8`/`PYTHONIOENCODING` pair `ensure_utf8_console()` sets on the gateway itself) to every pooled backend, so the child's stdio is UTF-8 on every platform while the control-plane classifier never sees the pair. `PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX` is exported by the desktop app at `<data home>/cache/pycache` to keep the embedded interpreter's bytecode out of the codesigned bundle; inherited into the agent subtree it makes every foreign interpreter (uv-managed pythons, ephemeral venvs run by the agent's bash) mirror its whole stdlib + site-packages under the crew home instead of writing `__pycache__` beside its own sources, and because each ephemeral root mints a fresh path-keyed mirror the cache grows without bound. What the gateway's own tree still legitimately writes there is bounded by `pycache_gc.prune_pycache` (TTL + total-size cap, run from `session.py`'s periodic sweep at most once per `PYCACHE_GC_INTERVAL_SECS`).

**Scoped user-bus locator forward (`XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` / `DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`)** — the cgroup v2 ceiling wraps every agent-influenced spawn in `systemd-run --user --scope` (`cgroup_scope_argv`, see `resource-protection.md`), and `systemd-run --user` needs the user session bus to create the scope. Callers that build the spawn environment from a strict **allowlist** instead of inheriting `os.environ` — `dashboard/source_providers/runner.py` (`_PROVIDER_BASE_ENV_KEYS`, the authenticated `gh`/`glab` spawns) is the live example — do not carry the two locators, so `systemd-run` exits 1 with `Failed to connect to bus: No medium found` and the wrapped command never execs. `sandboxed_spawn_argv` therefore calls `cgroup_scope_bus_env()` after `scrub_env`, gated on the same `_probe_cgroup_scope()` result that decides whether to wrap at all. That result follows the user's login rather than the process: it requires a bus socket that accepts a connection and is re-validated per spawn against a stat-only fingerprint of the runtime directory, bus sockets and user slice (plus a TTL), so after logind stops the user manager at logout neither the wrapper nor the locator forward is applied (see `resource-protection.md` §Availability and fallback).

A user-bus address inside the sandbox is an escape vector — it can ask the user systemd manager to start a unit that runs *outside* the namespace — so the forward is **paired with an `env -u XDG_RUNTIME_DIR -u DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` shim placed inside the scope** (immediately after `--`), which drops the locators again before the real command execs. `env` `exec`s in place, so `--scope`'s exec-into semantics, PID tracking, `killpg` and descendant scans are unchanged; it is resolved from an absolute path (`_ENV_BINARY_CANDIDATES`, never a caller-influenced `PATH`); and with no `env` binary the layer **fails closed** — the locators are not forwarded at all, so the wrapper fails loudly rather than handing the child a reachable bus.

The strip is deliberately **scoped to the keys this layer injected**, not applied unconditionally — mirroring why `_PYTHON_ENV_PREFIXES` above is conditional rather than part of `_SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES`. `scrub_env` does not (and never did) strip the bus locators, so callers that inherit `os.environ` — including the kiro-cli agent spawn — already pass them through: sandboxed agent shells legitimately run `systemctl --user` and the `kirocrew pod` CLI, which are bus-dependent. Unconditional stripping would silently remove that capability across every spawn site. **Documented residual:** an inherited-environment child therefore still reaches the user bus, exactly as before this layer existed. Closing that is a separate, wider change; this layer's invariant is only that it never *widens* bus reachability — a caller that had no bus keeps none.

**Fail-closed default when no backend**: when no sandbox backend is available, `wrap_argv()` **raises `RuntimeError`** by default rather than executing the agent unsandboxed — the secure default is to refuse, not degrade. The denial also emits a `denied` SEL tool-invocation event. Running unsandboxed is permitted only by an explicit `agent.sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec=true` **or** by the platform default for a host with no installable backend (Windows) — see "The default is platform-dependent" below; on every other platform an undeclared key still refuses. The narrow exception is an explicitly classified official Kiro CLI spawn on Windows: it delegates to Kiro's built-in sandbox, so it is not the generic unsandboxed fallback.

**Reclaiming abandoned agent scopes (`session_scope_reap.py`)** — the same transient `systemd-run --user --scope` that carries the cgroup ceiling GCs its unit only after its process exits, so a hard gateway kill or restart strands the scope (leader dead, children reparented to the systemd user manager, nothing reaps it — the report-only `session_pid._is_untracked_managed_agent_orphan` observes but cannot terminate it). The reaper runs as a session-cleanup tick hook (never on the boot path) to reconcile the cgroup tree against the live registry. Its blast radius is bounded by four conjunctive gates before any signal: it requires a complete tracked-PID snapshot, enumerates ONLY this install's per-instance child slice (`sandbox._agents_slice_name`, keyed on the data home), and splits scope authorization from member attribution. A scope-wide stop requires AT LEAST ONE positive agent-runtime argv anchor (generated launcher, an exact argv0 basename of `kiro-cli`, `kiro-cli-chat`, `claude-agent-acp`, or `claude`, or a marked MCP launcher); only then may marker-or-in-scope-descent attribution admit every member, including an env-clearing `chrome-headless` child. Marker inheritance alone never authorizes a stop, preserving intentional detached workloads. The accepted fail-closed residual is a leaked scope whose runtime anchors have all exited: even attributable survivors are left running because the reaper can no longer prove that the scope is an abandoned agent-runtime tree. Reclaim resolves `systemctl` from trusted system directories and its fallback opens a pidfd before re-verifying membership and identity (or ownership) and signalling, so PID reuse cannot redirect a signal; unavailable pidfd support fails closed.

**First-party fixed-argv carve-out**: the opt-in above conflated two decisions on a backend-less host — spawning Kiro Crew's OWN managed MCP servers (`kirocrew-core` / `-cron` / `-computer`, whose full argv is derived by `agent._kirocrew_mcp_invocation()` with no agent/repo/user-config input) and unconfining the `mode="strict"` hostile-input paths (the worktree handler's repo-controlled git `include.path`, Papyrus' crafted-`.tex` chokepoints). `wrap_argv(first_party_fixed_argv=True)` narrows that: a spawn whose caller vouches the argv is package-derived proceeds unconfined **only when ALL of** (1) the flag is set — a reviewed property, structurally ratcheted by `test/test_spawn_audit.py::FIRST_PARTY_SPAWNS` (a new site passing the kwarg without an allowlist entry fails CI); (2) the unavailability class is `no_backend` — a `transient` probe failure still raises (it self-heals and must not buy a bypass) and `foreign_sandbox` still raises (the host's sandbox is fine; the remedy is config, not bypass); (3) no governance `sandbox.min_level` floor is active (`_governance_sandbox_floor_active()`, the same read `_clamp_sandbox_mode` uses — a governed host keeps fail-closing for first-party spawns too). The allowed path applies the standard env scrub (via the trusted absolute-path `env` binary; where none exists — Windows — the chokepoint's `scrub_env` on the child environment is the guarantee), warns loudly once per process, and emits a SEL tool-invocation event with a **distinct third outcome, `unconfined`** (best-effort async write — unlike the rare one-shot `denied`/nested-passthrough audits, this fires per managed probe per discovery cycle on the gateway event loop, where a synchronous critical flush would stall the loop) — deliberately neither `denied` (nothing was refused) nor the nested-passthrough `allowed` (nothing confines the spawn); SEL failure there is log-and-proceed, matching the `mode="off"` delegation precedent. `sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec=true` remains a strict superset: with it set, behavior is byte-identical to before for all callers. The only current first-party site is the managed-server MCP probe, and it sets the flag only when the spec's command+args+env **equal** the freshly re-resolved managed invocation and that invocation is a resolved console-script binary (the `python -m kiro_crew` interpreter fallback never qualifies: `-m` prepends the child's CWD to `sys.path`, so an untrusted working directory could shadow the package) (env compared against the package-derived `_managed_mcp_env()`, since a spec-carried `LD_PRELOAD` changes what code runs for the same argv) — a customized command, args, or env under a managed name compares unequal and keeps the full opt-in requirement.

**The default is platform-dependent, and the wizard is how it is surfaced.** An UNDECLARED `sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec` resolves through `sandbox.unsandboxed_exec_platform_default()`: **allow on Windows, fail-closed everywhere else.** The split is by whether an operator can DO anything about a missing backend. A backend-less Linux or macOS host is broken or one AppArmor profile away from working, so it keeps fail-closing and `_no_backend_guidance()` names the profile that restores isolation; silently running unconfined there would hide a repairable host. Windows has no user namespace, no `sandbox-exec`, and nothing installable that would produce one, so fail-closed there was not a posture anyone could act on — it refused every script cron, hook, app backend, third-party MCP probe and provider CLI on the platform in perpetuity, and the observed outcome was users copying the flag out of an error message with no risk statement attached.

This is a deliberate trade with a real cost, recorded rather than glossed: on Windows it **removes a deny-by-default authorization**, and the `mode="strict"` threats are exactly as available afterwards as before (an agent-selected repo's `include.path` reaching `~/.aws/credentials`, a crafted `.tex` typesetting a secret into a PDF). What stands in its place, none of it equivalent:

- **A declared value always wins, in both directions**, and the resolution happens in the LOADER, into the dataclass value. `config.loader.unsandboxed_exec_platform_default()` is applied as the `.get()` default at the one place that sees the raw document, so the field carries the effective policy and `sandbox._allow_unsandboxed_exec()` stays a plain read. The meaning has to live in the VALUE rather than in whether the key is present: `KiroCrewConfig.save()` publishes the whole in-memory snapshot through `to_dict()` → `asdict(self.agent)`, so every full-document write (the boot default-config write, CLI one-shots) materializes this key — a presence-keyed policy would let that write silently convert "never decided" into a declared lockdown and refuse every spawn on a host with no installable backend. Pinned by `test_config_loader.py::test_windows_default_survives_a_full_document_round_trip`. `unsandboxed_exec_declared()` survives for DIAGNOSTICS only — audit labelling and message wording — and never gates execution; read the effective verdict from `sandbox.unsandboxed_exec_permitted_by()`.
- **A governance `sandbox.min_level` floor still overrides the default**, so a managed fleet keeps fail-closing on Windows too — `config.json` is not policy.
- **The provider-CLI validator leans on this absence.** `github_runner.validate_provider_executable()` refuses a root POSIX gateway because the sandbox's credential masks give a root agent something to escape by planting a provider binary; it does NOT refuse an elevated Windows gateway, because with no Windows backend the agent's shell already holds the gateway's token and there is no mask to escape. Whoever adds a Windows sandbox backend re-opens that validator's elevated-token decision in the same change.
- **Every unconfined spawn is SEL-audited**, `outcome="unconfined"`, with `resources` naming whether an operator or the platform permitted it. Before, an operator declaration made the config file itself the record; a platform grant has no such record, so without this event the spawn would leave no trace.
- **`_warn_no_isolation()` still fires** the one-shot loud `SECURITY` line, and on a platform grant it names the LOCKDOWN as the remedy instead of telling the reader to install a backend that does not exist.
- **`kirocrew setup` still asks**, now in the direction that matches the default: it offers the opt-IN where the default is fail-closed, and STATES the exposure (`~/.aws`, `~/.ssh`) and offers the opt-OUT where the default is allow, in the same words. Both directions default to **no** and write nothing on a decline, a bare Enter, or a non-interactive EOF — so the host keeps the platform default AND stays undeclared, and a later change to that default still reaches it. On a default-allow platform the non-interactive path still PRINTS the notice, because that run is otherwise told nothing. It never re-asks once the key is present in either state.
- **`kirocrew doctor` states the effective posture** for a backend-less host — refused, unconfined by operator, or unconfined by platform — where it previously reported only that no backend was present. On Linux, a `userns_denied` probe reports `cannot be verified from this shell` only when `/proc/self/uid_map` has exactly one identity entry (inside UID equals outside UID, length 1 — Kiro Crew's agent-shell shape) and `/proc/self/status` reports seccomp mode 2. Init maps, non-identity or multi-range container maps, and other seccomp modes keep the host-level failure and remedy. This only narrows a diagnostic exemption; it widens no sandbox permission or execution path.

`transient` and `foreign_sandbox` are unaffected: neither is `no_backend`, both still raise, and no platform default applies to them.

**Nested-sandbox passthrough**: when `wrap_argv()` is called from a process that is *already inside* a Kiro Crew sandbox (script-cron ticks, sandboxed agent children, app backends, pooled MCP servers), it returns the argv unchanged (one-shot info log) instead of trying to wrap again. Nested sandboxing is impossible on **both** backends — the Linux launcher's seccomp-BPF filter denies `unshare`/`setns`, and macOS Seatbelt refuses `sandbox_apply` with EPERM from inside an existing sandbox even under an `(allow default)` outer profile — so a nested wrap would fail with EPERM and the fail-closed `RuntimeError` above would brick **every** in-sandbox MCP spawn (the probe error was raised on each `ctx.call_tool` and silently swallowed by the caller). This is **not** a fail-open path: the outer namespace + seccomp still confine every descendant, so passthrough spawns within the existing isolation boundary. In-sandbox detection is env-marker based and **deny-by-default** (`_inside_kirocrew_sandbox()` / `_IN_SANDBOX_MARKER`): the gate keys **solely** on the explicit, single-purpose `KIROCREW_SANDBOX_ACTIVE=1`, which is exported at exactly two sites, each immediately after that platform's credential-env scrub: the Linux launcher `main()` (at the same site as `KIROCREW_HOST_PID`) and the macOS `env` prefix built by `sandbox_exec_argv()`. It deliberately does **not** key on `KIROCREW_HOST_PID` — that variable is dual-purpose session-identity plumbing, and gating a security-relevant passthrough on a variable set for unrelated reasons would be a latent bypass. No unsandboxed code path sets the marker. The passthrough is SEL-audited on **every** invocation via `log_tool_invocation(outcome="allowed", metadata={"reason": "nested_sandbox_passthrough"}, critical=True)`, mirroring the `denied` event on the fail-closed path so the security decision is tamper-evidently recorded. `critical=True` gives it the same write reliability as the `denied`/`delegated` audits — the event is written **synchronously** after draining the async backlog, so a slow or wedged background writer cannot silently drop passthrough records. It stops short of full audit-or-deny (re-raise on SEL failure) deliberately: unlike `_delegate_to_kiro_internal_sandbox` — which on audit failure falls back to Kiro Crew's own seatbelt, an equally-safe audited layer — a nested passthrough has **no** safe alternative (seccomp denies the re-wrap by design), so failing the spawn on a SEL filesystem error would couple every in-sandbox MCP call to SEL health and reintroduce a prior in-sandbox spawn outage. On a hard write failure it therefore logs loudly and proceeds: the child is confined by the outer namespace + seccomp whether or not the record lands.

**Passthrough tier comparison (downgrade detection)**: the marker alone proves *a* Kiro Crew sandbox is active, not *which tier* it was built at, so without a tier record the passthrough is tier-blind: an in-sandbox caller requesting `strict` under a `standard` outer sandbox silently runs at `standard`. Both launcher sites therefore export a companion `KIROCREW_SANDBOX_LEVEL=<standard|cc|strict>` (`_IN_SANDBOX_LEVEL_VAR`) beside the marker, with the same non-droppable placement (after the Linux launcher's env-scrub loop; after the macOS `env -u` flags), and `cli.main()` drops an inherited copy at the same site where it drops the marker itself (a stale ancestor's value would otherwise be read as the active tier). The passthrough resolves the requested mode to a tier via the shared `_mode_to_level()` helper and compares it against the active tier on the `standard(1) < cc(2) < strict(3)` ordinal order; an absent or unrecognized level var (an outer tree launched by an older build) reads as `unknown`, which carries no ordinal claim, so no downgrade can be proven against it, the passthrough is unaffected, and nothing crashes. Every passthrough audit event carries `requested_tier`, `active_tier`, `tier_known`, and `tier_downgrade` in its SEL metadata — `tier_known` separates "proven no downgrade" from "unprovable" — so a downgrade is *visible in the audit log* rather than inferred. On a proven downgrade (`requested > active`) the passthrough additionally emits a per-call `SECURITY:` warning naming both tiers and the executable, and prefixes the returned argv with the requested tier's `env -u` scrub (`_sandbox_env_unset_args` — a delta in practice, since the outer launcher already removed the shared prefixes): the one slice of the stricter tier that IS enforceable without a nested wrap (agent-denied credential env keys a `standard` outer launcher never scrubbed). The `env` binary is resolved only at a trusted absolute path (`_unset_env_argv`); when none exists the scrub is skipped with a loud warning rather than resolving `env` through a PATH this environment controls. It deliberately does **not** fail closed: refusing the downgrade breaks every in-sandbox caller that legitimately requests `strict` from a `standard` app-backend sandbox (Dev Fleet Sync/Provision), and the file-level residual gap is exactly what the audit records.

**macOS marker site and the kernel cross-check**: the macOS seatbelt path previously set **no** marker — it is exported only by the Linux namespace launcher — so the passthrough above did not apply on macOS at all. `_probe_sandbox_exec()` therefore failed whenever Kiro Crew was already confined, `detect_backend()` cached that EPERM as `"none"`, and the fail-closed branch rejected **every** spawn with "No OS-level sandbox backend is available on this host" — false on a host whose `sandbox-exec` works unnested, and severe in practice (~40 `MCP probe failed` entries at gateway boot, app backends unable to start, Dev Fleet / Files `git` failing). `sandbox_exec_argv()` now sets `KIROCREW_SANDBOX_ACTIVE=1` in the same `env` prefix that already performs the credential-env scrub, as an assignment placed **after** the `-u` flags so they cannot drop it. Because `_sandbox_env_unset_args()` derives that scrub from the **same** `_SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES` / `_AGENT_DENIED_ENV_KEYS` / `_PYTHON_ENV_PREFIXES` logic as the Linux launcher, a marked process always has an environment Kiro Crew already sanitised — which is what makes the passthrough safe for the callers that use `wrap_argv()` directly rather than `sandboxed_spawn_argv()`.

On macOS the marker must additionally **agree with the kernel**, and the two cover each other's blind spot. The marker proves Kiro Crew built the outer sandbox and scrubbed the environment on the way in, but an env var alone could be forged or inherited. `_macos_sandbox_state()` asks the kernel directly via `sandbox_check(pid, NULL, SANDBOX_FILTER_NONE)`, which is OS-authoritative and unspoofable but cannot identify *whose* profile is active, so it can never grant the passthrough on its own. It is deliberately **tri-state** rather than boolean: a definite `False` (kernel says not sandboxed) alongside a present marker proves the marker was forged into an unconfined process and **vetoes** the passthrough with a `SECURITY:` warning, whereas `None` (symbol unavailable, ABI change, restricted dyld, or non-darwin) says nothing at all and must **not** retroactively invalidate a marker the Linux path honours unconditionally. The state is `lru_cache`d — a process cannot leave its sandbox.

**Foreign outer sandboxes are still refused.** Reaching the fail-closed branch while the kernel reports this process *is* sandboxed means the confiner is one Kiro Crew did **not** build — kiro-cli >= 2.13's own internal seatbelt (see the mutual-exclusion rule above) or an operator-wrapped gateway. Those are refused, because macOS exposes no supported way to identify which profile is active (the path-scoped `sandbox_check` form that could prove the outer profile denies credential reads is variadic and returns `-1` through ctypes on arm64), and the env scrub that makes the marker case safe may never have run. What the detection fixes there is the **diagnosis**: `_inside_macos_sandbox()` lets the error state that the host's sandbox is not broken and point at the config-level remedy — disabling kiro-cli's internal sandbox so Kiro Crew's own profile owns isolation, which **keeps** isolation rather than weakening it — instead of the previous claim that the host has no backend, which sent operators hunting for something that was never missing. It deliberately does not steer them to `sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec`, which permits unwrapped spawns even when no sandbox confines the process at all.

**No-isolation fallback is loud (SEC-009)**: *on the permitted path only* (`sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec=true`, or the platform default on a host with no installable backend), `wrap_argv()` runs the agent with no isolation (graceful — the host is not bricked) but never degrades silently: it emits a one-shot loud `SECURITY` warning. A second, distinct flag `agent.sandbox_allow_no_isolation=true` (config-modal editable) acknowledges the risk and demotes that message to info level — it governs *log level only*, not whether execution is permitted (that gate is `allow_unsandboxed_exec`).

**macOS sandbox mutual exclusion**: kiro-cli ≥ 2.13 ships an *internal* agent sandbox in the binary itself, toggled by the `"sandbox"` key in `~/.kiro/settings/amazon-internal.json` (the kiro-cli backend's own settings dir — distinct from Kiro Crew's data home `~/.kiro/crew`; the filename is the literal kiro-cli ships). Its in-process seatbelt init cannot nest inside Kiro Crew's sandbox-exec wrap: the macOS kernel returns EPERM even under an `(allow default)` outer profile, so **exactly one sandbox layer can be active per kiro-cli spawn**. `wrap_argv()` enforces mutual exclusion on macOS: when `kiro_internal_sandbox_enabled()` is true and the spawn is kiro-cli (argv basename, same convention as `_resolve_kiro_bin`), the seatbelt wrap is skipped and kiro's internal sandbox owns isolation (`_delegate_to_kiro_internal_sandbox()`); when it is false, Kiro Crew's seatbelt engages as always. Invariants: (1) this is **not** the forbidden silent unsandboxed fallback (SEC-009) — delegation is config-driven and deterministic, never a reaction to a wrap failure; the child still runs under an OS sandbox; the decision is logged loudly once per process and every delegated spawn emits a SEL audit event (`outcome="delegated"`, `critical=True`) on an **audit-or-deny** basis: if the audit event cannot be written, the delegation is refused and the spawn falls back to Kiro Crew's own seatbelt (safety over availability while SEL is broken); (2) the env scrub (`_sandbox_env_unset_args`, shared with `sandbox_exec_argv`) is applied identically on the delegated path; (3) only kiro-cli spawns may delegate — all other agent-influenced spawns keep Kiro Crew's wrap regardless of the settings file; (4) the settings read routes through `hooks.safe_read_file` (`is_sensitive_path` on the resolved target + `O_NOFOLLOW` — a symlinked settings file pointing at a sensitive path is refused) and fails toward `False` on any failure (absent/malformed/non-dict JSON, refused read, home-resolution failure → Kiro Crew's sandbox stays on); it is uncached so a settings flip applies to the next spawn; (5) macOS-only — Linux namespace isolation is unaffected.

**Delegation is reported, not just logged.** Delegation changes which paths the agent can reach — kiro-cli's profile scopes file access to the session workspace, so reading a *pre-existing* file outside it (`~/Desktop`, a project elsewhere) fails with `Operation not permitted` while files the session created stay readable. That presents as a macOS privacy (TCC) problem and is not one: Full Disk Access cannot affect a Seatbelt profile, so an operator who is told only "permission denied" grants FDA, relaunches, and observes no change (#11623). Two surfaces close that: the once-per-process `SECURITY` warning names the settings file and key that decided it, and `kirocrew doctor`'s **Sandbox** section prints a `kiro-cli:` line after the backend verdict (`_doctor_kiro_internal_sandbox`), naming the switch via `kiro_internal_sandbox_switch()`, ruling out Full Disk Access explicitly, and giving the config-level remedy — set the key to `false` so Kiro Crew's own profile owns isolation, which *keeps* isolation rather than weakening it. Reporting only the backend is a false reassurance here, because `backend: ✅ seatbelt` describes a wrap that a delegated kiro-cli spawn never runs under. The line is **not** counted as an issue: delegation is a working, audited configuration, and `kirocrew doctor` must not exit non-zero on a correctly configured host. **The remedy is conditional on the tier Kiro Crew would actually apply** (`effective_sandbox_mode(configured_sandbox_mode())`, which includes the governance clamp): under `agent.sandbox="off"` no profile is built, so recommending the internal sandbox off would remove the *only* layer confining the spawn and make `~/.aws` and `~/.ssh` readable. The two settings correlate rather than being independently unlikely — `"off"` exists to defer isolation to kiro-cli — so that branch names the order instead (`agent.sandbox` to `"auto"` first, then either layer owns isolation), and a tier that cannot be read gets the cautious wording rather than the bare recommendation.

**Windows Kiro internal-sandbox delegation**: Kiro Crew has no native Windows OS wrapper, but the official Kiro CLI backend has its own sandbox. `wrap_argv()` therefore delegates before backend detection when, and only when, the reviewed caller passes `is_kiro_cli=True`. This is a positive capability grant from `ACP_BACKENDS_INTERNAL_SANDBOX`; `_spawns_kiro_cli()` basename inference and `is_kiro_cli=None` never grant it on Windows. The main ACP client/runtime and the three fixed one-shot Kiro reads pass the classification explicitly. Extra Kiro Crew path restrictions (`extra_hidden_dirs` / `extra_visible_dirs`) disable delegation because Kiro's sandbox cannot prove it enforces them. Every delegation is `outcome="delegated"`, `critical=True`; an SEL failure returns to normal Windows no-backend policy and raises. All other ACP backends, scripts, hooks, third-party MCP probes, Papyrus/Polly commands and future unclassified spawns take the ordinary Windows no-backend path, which the platform default permits unless the operator declared `agent.sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec=false` or a governance `sandbox.min_level` floor is pinned; they are audited `unconfined` rather than delegated, since nothing confines them. Because Windows cannot prefix `env -u`, every delegated production spawn passes `scrub_agent_subprocess_env()` as its explicit child environment.

**Boot must isolate the fail-closed raise**: because the `RuntimeError` above can fire per-spawn, callers that launch multiple child processes at boot must catch it. `start_enabled_app_backends()` (`apps/backend_runtime/startup.py`) wraps each `start_app_backend()` in try/except so one app that cannot be sandboxed (e.g. on macOS 26 where `sandbox-exec` is gone) is logged + `error`-audited + **skipped** (never spawned unsandboxed), and the gateway (Slack + dashboard + every session) still boots — matching the fail-isolated posture of the admission re-vet and MCP reconcile branches in the same loop.

**Why standard is a deliberate trade-off**: the file-tool layer (`is_sensitive_path()`) blocks direct reads of `~/.aws/*` and `~/.ssh/*`, but the shell-command gate deliberately matches no paths. Standard mode leaves those stores visible so git-over-SSH and `credential_process` can work; strict mode is the tier that hides them from subprocesses. `redact_credentials()` remains an output-boundary backstop, not a substitute for strict isolation.

Config: `agent.sandbox` in `config.json` — `"auto"` (standard), `"strict"`, or `"off"`. All three are admitted by the config enum (`config/sections.py`), the CLI write gate (`kirocrew config set agent.sandbox strict`) and the Settings enum (`dashboard/handlers/core.py`), which `test_sandbox_strict_selectable.py` pins equal; the loader keeps a hand-written `"strict"` rather than degrading it. `"strict"` is opt-in and tightens only a spawn Kiro Crew wraps itself: Windows has no OS backend, and a macOS spawn delegated to kiro-cli's internal sandbox is confined by that profile, so on those paths `"strict"` and `"auto"` produce the same child. The default stays `"auto"`; an operator who never wrote `"strict"` sees no change. Like every value of the key, a flip applies to sessions spawned after it: `agent.sandbox` carries no `restart=True` mark and is in `_FACTORY_CONFIG_PATHS`, so the applier rebuilds the provider factory and drains the warm pool but leaves live sessions at the tier they were spawned with; the tightening half of that gap is #5031 and is not closed by admitting `"strict"`.

**Callers must pass the configured tier explicitly.** `wrap_argv`'s `mode` parameter defaults to `"auto"`, which coincides with the shipped `agent.sandbox` default but is **not** the same thing: it ignores what the operator actually configured. Where `agent.sandbox` is an explicit `"off"` (isolation deferred to kiro-cli's internal sandbox), a spawn that omits `mode` requests isolation the operator did not ask for. Explicitly classified Windows Kiro spawns delegate at either tier, but the configured value still keeps every one-shot read from being *stricter* than the long-lived chat session it accompanies across platforms. The interactive ACP spawns thread the value through their `sandbox_mode` constructor argument; one-shot `kiro-cli` reads call `sandbox.configured_sandbox_mode()` (owning module: `sandbox.py`) instead of relying on the default. This is deliberately **not** a change to `wrap_argv`'s own default, which must stay fail-secure for callers that genuinely want a tier independent of config — the prerequisite probes' `strict`, the credential-free registry clones. See `modules/acp-client.md` for the affected sites and the user-visible symptoms.

Wired into `AcpClient._spawn()` — all kiro-cli processes are sandboxed. Parent Kiro Crew process is unaffected. Zero new dependencies (stdlib + system binaries only).

**Linux namespace sandbox**: Fork child → child calls `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` → parent writes identity UID/GID map (`uid uid 1` / `gid gid 1`) to `/proc/<child>/{setgroups,uid_map,gid_map}` → child calls `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)`, sets mount propagation private (`MS_REC|MS_PRIVATE`), bind-mounts empty dirs over credential paths (per mode), scrubs sensitive env vars (`AWS_SECRET*`, `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, etc.), and execs the agent. Two-pipe synchronization ensures correct ordering. The child retains the real UID/GID so all toolchains (JVM ByteBuddy, Gradle, npm, etc.) work without workarounds. Implemented as a Python launcher script (`_build_launcher_script()`) spawned by `namespace_argv()`.

**The launcher's parent is the pid the gateway tracks**, because it never execs: it writes the maps and then blocks in `waitpid` for the life of the session. So anything that identifies an agent process from its command line sees `<interpreter> -I -S <run dir>/kirocrew_sandbox_<pid>_<rand>.py <harness argv…>` rather than the harness. The shape's three CONSTANT parts are the module constants `_LAUNCHER_INTERPRETER_FLAGS`, `_SANDBOX_ARTIFACT_PREFIX` and `_LAUNCHER_SCRIPT_SUFFIX`, which `session_pid`'s gate and `clone_setup`'s traceback regex both read directly off this module rather than copying. `namespace_launcher_script_dir()` is the one part that is not a constant (`<config_dir>/run`, normalized because `mkstemp` returns an `abspath` on 3.12+) and is therefore a named function, read by `_ensure_run_dir()` here and by that gate: resolving it goes through `config_dir()`, which creates the data home and can raise, so a caller on a per-PID hot path matches everything free first and asks for the directory last. The tmpdir fallback `_ensure_run_dir()` degrades to is NOT part of the exported shape — it is shared with every other user of the host, so it must not decide which process trees are reclaimable, and `gettempdir()` therefore stays on the fallback branch where it was (an eager call fails on a read-only-root container with no writable tmp). Both `mkstemp` calls take their prefix and suffix from those same constants rather than repeating them, which is what makes the accessor truthful; `session_pid`'s managed-agent gate (the kill authorization for the PID-file reclaim) is that reader, and a copied literal there would have cost every sandboxed root its reclaim the day a launcher flag was added. Recognising the shape changes nothing the sandbox seals, masks or exposes. Full gate contract in [session.md](session.md) §Reclaim identity.

**Linux capability probe mirrors the split sequence**: `_probe_unshare_once()` performs the *same* fork → `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` → parent-writes-maps → `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)` → `mount(MS_REC|MS_PRIVATE)` on `/` handshake as the launcher above, because the steps do **not** behave identically when combined or skipped. A single `unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWNS)` is satisfied atomically and **succeeds** on hosts where the split sequence fails: with Ubuntu's `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns=1` (default since 23.10, and the discriminator is that **sysctl being 1**, not whether AppArmor is loaded — Debian 13 ships AppArmor and is unaffected), creating a user namespace transitions the process into a restricted AppArmor profile carrying no `CAP_SYS_ADMIN`, so the *second* unshare returns EPERM while the identity map writes succeed. The probe therefore previously reported such hosts as `namespace`-capable and every real spawn died with `sandbox: unshare(NEWNS) failed: errno 1` — verified on Ubuntu 24.04 and 26.04. The propagation mount is the same story one step later: a container under its runtime's **default AppArmor profile** (`deny mount`, the Kubernetes default on AppArmor nodes, which apply no seccomp filter) passes both unshares and refuses the mount with `EACCES`, so a probe that stopped at the unshares reported the pod sandbox-capable and every real spawn died with `sandbox: BLOCKED -- making mount propagation private on / failed: errno 13`. The probe's mount is exactly the launcher's first one — nothing is bind-mounted or hidden, and the namespace ends with the probe child. The probe's `reason` names the failing step (`unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)` / a `/proc/<pid>/...` map write / `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)` / `mount(MS_REC|MS_PRIVATE) on /`) so callers can distinguish mechanisms that share an errno: a NEWNS denial is the AppArmor userns restriction, NEWUSER with ENOSPC/EUSERS is a hardened `user.max_user_namespaces=0`, and a mount denial is the container runtime's policy (`REMEDY_MOUNT_DENIED`; the kernel itself never refuses this to a process that owns the namespace, so EACCES is AppArmor and EPERM a seccomp filter, both permanent for the life of the container). Classification is unchanged — EPERM stays **permanent** (an AppArmor denial will not clear on retry) and only `_TRANSIENT_PROBE_ERRNOS` are transient; a child that vanishes mid-handshake is treated as transient without widening that set. Each step is one line on the child→parent pipe and the child waits for a parent release byte between steps, because the reader keeps only the first line of a read: two reports written back to back would lose the second. All verdict logic runs in the parent, driven by the child's pipe reports, so tests cover every branch without forking; the handshake is bounded by a timeout and the child is reaped on every path so the background warm thread can neither wedge nor leak. The spawned probe shim (`_PROBE_SHIM_CODE`) and the fork child speak the same three-step wire protocol (`U`/`N`/`P`, plus `M` for the multithreaded collapse) so one parent drives either.

**The launcher's own refusal becomes a typed verdict only through a trusted launcher run** (`launcher_refusal()` + `corroborate_launcher_refusal()`): `wrap_argv()` raises `SandboxUnavailableError` when the sandbox cannot be built *before* the spawn, but the launcher can also refuse *after* it -- a host that passed the probe can still deny a control at spawn time, and a probe verdict cached under one policy can outlive a policy change. That refusal reaches the caller only as exit 1 plus one `sandbox:`-prefixed line on stderr (`_mount_or_die`, the two unshare steps, the prctl/seccomp installs, the handshake `FATAL`s), which every caller read as "the child is broken" -- the first-run gate reported a present, signed-in `kiro-cli` as **not installed**. `launcher_refusal()` recognizes the launcher's fixed prefixes and nothing else (a child that mentions "sandbox" mid-line, or fails on its own, never matches) and classifies the line into the same `(kind, detail, remedy)` triple the typed error carries -- a refused mount or unshare is `no_backend` with its errno classified by the *same* step table the probe uses, the filter installs are `no_backend` with no token, a handshake `FATAL` is `transient`, and a refusal about **host state** (a hardlinked credential, an unreadable `known_hosts`) is `None`, left as the child's own complaint. **That classification is never the verdict.** The child is the unverified candidate itself, running inside the sandbox the launcher built, and a planted `kiro-cli` can print the launcher's exact line and exit 1; a caller that trusted it would let that binary make the gate announce "sandbox unavailable" and offer the operator the `sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec` opt-out that disables the isolation it is running under. So `corroborate_launcher_refusal()` uses the candidate's line only to decide *whether* to look further: it re-runs the **real launcher** around a trusted no-op (`true`) under the refused spawn's own `mode` and hidden/visible dirs, and classifies THAT run's own stderr through `launcher_refusal()` (Linux only -- off Linux the prefixes can only be the child's text, and the launcher would refuse for reasons of its own), returns `None` while the no-op still exits 0 (the line was forged or the refusal momentary) or times out, the pre-spawn `SandboxUnavailableError`'s own triple when the sandbox cannot be built for the no-op at all, and otherwise the launcher's own `(kind, detail, remedy)` from a run whose stderr no child wrote. It reads and writes nothing in the backend cache: a spawn's report must not move a process-wide verdict on a child's say-so, even by way of a real launcher run. Running the whole launcher rather than the three-step boot probe is deliberate: the probe mirrors only the two unshares and the propagation mount, so a policy that refused a **later** step (a hiding bind mount, `NO_NEW_PRIVS`, the seccomp-BPF install) left the probe building the sandbox while every real spawn died and the refusal was misreported as `installed=False`; the no-op runs every step, so its stderr carries whichever one this host refuses. `kiro_prerequisite._run_process` applies it, in a worker thread, to every non-zero exit whose output carries a launcher line on the platforms where a launcher ran (never on Windows, where the wrap is skipped), and the prerequisite status then reports `installed=True, sandbox_unavailable=True` with the trusted run's detail and remedy instead of `installed=False`.

**On Windows the whole spawn leaves the gateway loop** (`kiro_prerequisite._run_on_private_loop`). The wrap above is skipped there, so `_run_process` reached `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` directly — and on the Proactor loop that call performs `CreateProcess` **synchronously on the loop thread**: `_make_subprocess_transport` constructs `_WindowsSubprocessTransport` before its first `await`, that constructor calls `_start()`, and `_start` calls `windows_utils.Popen` → `subprocess.Popen._execute_child`. There is no await point in the chain, so on an image whose endpoint-protection filter driver makes process creation take seconds the loop advanced nothing for the duration — and the dashboard's idle polling forces a re-probe about every 30 s (`/api/models` every 8 s against a 30 s freshness window), several spawns per probe, against one 25 s loop-stall budget. So the Windows path re-enters `_run_process` once on a PRIVATE event loop owned by a `kiro_spawn_executor()` worker (`executors.py`), marked by the private `_on_private_loop` argument, and the gateway loop only awaits the result. A private loop rather than a rewrite to blocking `Popen` is what keeps the retained-tree guarantee unchanged: the descendant tracker, the exact-handle snapshots and the terminate path still run against a real `asyncio.subprocess.Process`. That pool is deliberately **not** `subprocess_executor()` — the offloaded loop awaits `descendant_termination_handles_async`, which submits into that pool, so one shared pool would let concurrent spawns hold workers while waiting on scans queued behind them. Two residues are accepted: `asyncio.to_thread(asyncio.create_subprocess_exec, ...)` is **not** an alternative (it is a coroutine function, so a thread only returns an unawaited coroutine and the spawn still happens on the caller's loop), and a cancelled caller does not reach the worker — a started `run_in_executor` future cannot be cancelled, so the child is reaped by the body's own `timeout_secs` instead of at once, with the same `finally` still terminating the tree and closing every handle.

**Ubuntu userns remedy — a per-application AppArmor profile installed by `kirocrew service install`** (`service/apparmor.py`): the probe above makes the restriction *visible*; this makes it *fixable* without weakening the host. Ubuntu's sanctioned mechanism for an application that legitimately needs unprivileged userns is a per-app profile granting `userns`, not a kernel-wide sysctl rollback — `/etc/apparmor.d/` on a stock install already ships exactly this for `bwrap-userns-restrict`, `chrome`, `chromium`, `brave`, `buildah`, `ch-run`, `QtWebEngineProcess`, `1password` and `Discord`.

- **Gated on the detected mechanism, never on distro ID.** All of: AppArmor present in `/sys/kernel/security/lsm`, `kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` **existing and equal to 1**, and `apparmor_parser` ≥ 4.x (the `userns` rule's minimum). Any miss skips silently and the install continues, so Debian, Arch, RHEL, Amazon Linux and macOS are unaffected no-ops. Keying on `/etc/os-release` would both miss Ubuntu derivatives (Pop!_OS, Mint, Zorin, elementary) that inherit the restriction and wrongly target Debian 13, which ships AppArmor *without* it.
- **A NAMED profile ATTACHED to the resolved launcher script, `AppArmorProfile=` deliberately absent from the unit** (#3463). Two earlier designs were wrong. Attaching to the gateway's *interpreter* is wrong in both directions: `~/.kiro/crew-venv/bin/python3` is a **symlink** to the system interpreter and AppArmor matches the path the kernel resolves, so a venv-path attachment silently never matches, while attaching to the resolved `/usr/bin/python3` would grant unprivileged userns to **every Python process on the host**. A NAMED profile with no attachment, applied purely via `AppArmorProfile=-kirocrew-userns` in the unit, looked safer and shipped first (#1210) — but #3463 traced a live failure through `/proc/<pid>/attr/current` and the kernel audit log and found that directive labels only the literal top-level unit PID (`change_onexec` "converted to stacking"); the gateway's sandbox probe runs in a forked-not-exec'd child reached through the launcher's own exec chain, and that PID was still `unconfined` when it called `unshare()` — reproduced identically across a systemd-managed service, a bare foreground launch, and `aa-exec -p` (which stacks the top PID correctly and still fails downstream). Worse, installing a path-attached profile *and* keeping `AppArmorProfile=` in the unit makes the directive's `change_onexec` silently win over the kernel's automatic path attachment, so the two are mutually exclusive in practice. The fix: attach the profile **by path to the fully-resolved launcher script** (`kirocrew_bin()` — the same path `ExecStart` uses, e.g. `~/.kiro/crew-venv/bin/kirocrew`; not the interpreter, not any symlink in the chain) and drop the directive entirely. Kernel-side automatic attachment applies at every `execve()` in that chain and is inherited by a forked-not-exec'd child, which is the propagation the directive was missing. `validate_exec_path()` (shared with the launcher profile below) enforces this cannot be a shared interpreter, cannot live under a world-writable directory, and must be owned by the account the *service* runs as.
- **`flags=(unconfined)` and a single `userns,` rule** — the profile restricts nothing else; it exists only to carry that one grant, the same shape `/etc/apparmor.d/chrome` uses.
- **The abi is detected from the policy files present** (`/etc/apparmor.d/abi/`, highest numeric wins, omitted when none exist), not from the parser version: Ubuntu 25.10 ships `apparmor_parser` 5.x but only `abi/3.0` and `abi/4.0` on disk, so pinning the abi to the parser major makes the profile fail to load with `Could not open 'abi/5.0'`.
- **Validate before loading, verify enforcement after.** The generated profile is parsed with `apparmor_parser -Q --skip-cache` (`--skip-cache` because writing `/var/cache/apparmor` needs root and this runs before any privileged step) and is NOT installed if it fails to compile — loading a broken profile is how a service becomes unstartable. After `apparmor_parser -r`, enforcement is confirmed by transitioning into the profile with `aa-exec -p` and running a namespace probe, because the installing process is not itself confined by a profile systemd applies to the service, so probing in-process would report the unpatched host. Three constraints shape that check. It needs **privilege to enter** the profile — `aa_change_onexec()` into a named profile is not permitted for an unconfined user and `aa-exec` does not fail loudly when it cannot transition, it execs unconfined, so an unprivileged attempt returns a false negative. It must **not execute anything user-writable as root**: every tool (`apparmor_parser`, `aa-exec`, `setpriv`, `python3`) is resolved from a fixed list of trusted system directories and required to be root-owned and not group/world-writable — never through `$PATH`, and never `sys.executable`, since the venv interpreter is user-writable and running it under `sudo` would be a local privilege escalation — and the payload is a constant stdlib snippet that does not import `kiro_crew`, so user-writable site-packages never runs with privilege. And the probe itself must run **unprivileged**, or it proves nothing: root may be permitted to create namespaces regardless of the restriction, so `setpriv` drops back to the invoking uid/gid inside the profile before probing. A missing trusted tool is reported as inconclusive rather than as a failure, and a profile that loads but does not take effect is worse than none, so an unconfirmed verification says exactly that instead of claiming success.
- **The profile is loaded BEFORE the unit is started.** A path attachment applies at the kernel's own `execve()` time, so it must already be loaded before the first exec of the launcher script or the first gateway process (and everything it forks) comes up unprofiled. `linux.install()` therefore writes the unit, loads the profile, and only then runs `daemon-reload`/`enable`/`restart`.
- **Fail-soft throughout, and symmetric on removal.** No step here can fail the service install; every path returns an outcome the CLI prints (`⚠️` on failure) and continues. `service uninstall` unloads (`apparmor_parser -R`) and deletes the profile, so a host is left as it was found rather than carrying an orphaned grant. Privilege reuses the existing `sudo install` / `sudo systemctl` path the unit write already needs — no new escalation, and no Kiro Crew or LLM-influenced code runs under sudo.
- **Verified end to end on Ubuntu 26.04** with the sysctl at 1: inside the profile `detect_backend()` returns `namespace`; outside it, on the same host at the same moment, `none` with `unshare(CLONE_NEWNS) failed with errno 1 (EPERM)`; and `apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns` remains `1` — the grant is app-scoped and the kernel-wide protection is untouched.
- Other ways unprivileged userns can be denied are **not** addressed by this profile and have different remedies (and different errnos): `user.max_user_namespaces=0` denies NEWUSER with ENOSPC/EUSERS; Debian's legacy `kernel.unprivileged_userns_clone=0`; a kernel without `CONFIG_USER_NS` (EINVAL/ENOSYS); a container whose seccomp filter denies `unshare`, which is fixed with container flags, not host config; and a container that grants both namespaces but whose runtime's default AppArmor profile denies the propagation `mount` (EACCES — the Kubernetes default on AppArmor nodes), fixed by running the container with AppArmor unconfined plus a seccomp profile permitting `unshare`/`mount`, or by the `sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec` opt-in (`docs/guides/docker.md` § "Kubernetes and AppArmor"). The probe's step-aware reason is what makes these distinguishable at diagnosis time.
- **A DIRECT launch (AppImage / desktop app) needs a SECOND, separately-named profile** — `/etc/apparmor.d/kirocrew-launcher`, installed by `kirocrew sandbox install-profile`, kept distinct from the service profile above even though both are now path-attached. The reason is not attachment-vs-not (both attach); it is that the service profile's target is *automatically resolved and always known* (`kirocrew_bin()`, the same path `ExecStart` uses, loaded before the unit starts), while a direct launch has no unit to load anything before, no reliably-known target without user input (`$APPIMAGE` / `--path`), and cannot transition itself into a profile at all: entering a named profile needs `aa_change_onexec`, which an unprivileged unconfined process is not permitted to do, and `aa-exec` does not fail loudly when it cannot transition — it execs unconfined, so a re-exec would appear to work while changing nothing (`sudo aa-exec` does transition, but would run the gateway as root). An attachment is applied by the kernel at exec time with no cooperation from the process, and is inherited by the backend; it is the mechanism stock Ubuntu already uses for `chrome`, `brave`, `1password` and `Discord`. An AppImage is a single self-contained file used by nothing else, which is what makes it a safe attachment target.
- **The attachment target is validated, because an attachment is a permission grant keyed on a path.** `validate_exec_path()` resolves the path first (AppArmor matches what the kernel resolves, so validating the pre-resolution path would let a symlink in a safe directory smuggle a grant onto `/bin/sh`) and then refuses: a **world-writable component anywhere in the chain up to `/`** (a writable *ancestor* is enough — rename the parent and the same absolute path resolves to an attacker's file; this also covers an AppImage's own `/tmp/.mount_XXXXXX`, a fresh random path per launch), a **shared interpreter** (`/usr/bin/python3`, `/bin/sh`, `node`, …), a path containing **glob metacharacters**, which AppArmor interprets inside an attachment even when quoted, and **any target not owned by the expected account**. That last rule is what makes the check sound: the interpreter regex is a blocklist, and a blocklist of shared runtimes is incomplete by construction — it names python, perl, ruby, node and the shells but not `java`, `mono`, `dotnet`, `php`, `lua`, `wine`, `R` or `qemu-*`, so `--path /usr/bin/java` would have granted unprivileged userns to every Java process on the host. Requiring ownership converts that leaky list into a complete invariant, since a root-owned executable in a system location is by definition shared with every user of the machine. "Expected account" defaults to the invoking process's own uid (the AppImage/launcher case: an unprivileged user runs `kirocrew sandbox install-profile` on their own account) but is an explicit `expected_uid` override for the service case (#3463): `kirocrew service install` may itself run as root or under `sudo`, while the venv launcher script it attaches to is owned by the human the *service*'s `User=` names — a different account from whoever is executing the installer, so the check verifies against that account, not the installer's own euid. Stock Ubuntu's `chrome`/`brave` profiles do attach to root-owned binaries, which is not a contradiction: a packager knows the path is one specific application, whereas this command is handed an arbitrary `--path` and cannot. Packaged profiles remain the answer for a system-wide install, and an administrator who deliberately runs the AppImage case as root can still attach to a root-owned path — the rule exists to stop an unprivileged user over-granting by accident. The default target for the launcher case is `$APPIMAGE`; a foreground `kirocrew gateway` has no safe target at all and is directed to `service install` instead. Both profiles share one gate, one parser resolution, one compile check and one enforcement probe (`verify_enforcement(..., profile_name=…)`), so they cannot drift apart in what counts as a supported host or a working grant.
- **A path attachment fails silently when the path changes**, which is the one failure mode the kernel reports no error for: a moved or renamed AppImage simply stops matching. `kirocrew sandbox status` compares the installed attachment against the current launch and reports a stale one as not covered, and the desktop app logs the exact remedy command at spawn time (`website/electron/sandbox-profile.js`) rather than attempting to escalate — `sudo` needs a TTY a GUI does not have. Install also warns when another profile in `/etc/apparmor.d` already attaches to the same path, since a hand-written profile is the workaround users find first and two profiles claiming one attachment is ambiguous.

**Edition-neutral executable resolution**: `namespace_argv()` (Linux) and
`sandbox_exec_argv()` (macOS) resolve argv[0] through
`PlatformContext.agent_executable` before applying Kiro Crew's outer sandbox.
The public `DefaultAgentExecutableResolver` is identity, so ordinary PATH
resolution and an explicit `KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN` override behave unchanged. An
edition companion may replace a managed launcher with the direct executable it
ultimately invokes when nesting two OS-isolation layers would fail. This seam
cannot disable sandboxing: the resolved executable is always placed *inside*
the same namespace/Seatbelt wrapper. A transient resolver failure falls back to
the original executable while preserving the outer sandbox; a platform
composition failure propagates fail-closed. The capability probe
(`_probe_sandbox_exec`) still runs only the trusted fixed `/usr/bin/true` target
under `(allow default)`, never an edition-resolved or user-writable executable.

#### A sandbox that refuses to initialize is classified, never retried and never downgraded

A host whose sandbox cannot be built refuses the same way on every attempt, so the
ACP reconnect budget — which exists for transport faults — buys nothing and hides
the cause: the operator saw the agent process exit, while the reason sat on the
child's stderr (`sandbox initialization failed: Operation not permitted`,
`sandbox-exec: sandbox_apply: ...`, or one of the Linux launcher's own
`sandbox: BLOCKED ...` prefixes).

Both ACP transports detect that signature in the spawn/init window
(`acp.client.is_sandbox_init_failure_output`) and raise `AcpSandboxInitFailed`, a
non-retryable `AcpError` in the same family as `AcpAuthRequired` and
`AcpToolGateUnroutable`: `transient` is a fixed `False`, so every retry ladder that
reads the verdict off the exception stops on the first one, and `AcpClient` skips the
second of its two init attempts outright. The detector is anchored on a sandbox token
in each alternative — the burst's other lines (`Failed to spawn child process`,
`Operation not permitted`) are ordinary output for a missing binary or a denied file,
and matching those alone would make ordinary spawn failures permanent.

**A restricted-memory session is the one exception, by design.** `AcpClient` reads its
own stderr ring buffer, which such a session deliberately does not fill, so it cannot
classify and keeps its retry rather than guessing. The shared runtime has no such gap:
it latches per line at its drain, before retention is applied.

**The latch is a verdict about one child's STARTUP, and it is spent when `initialize`
completes.** A rejected credential does not un-reject itself, so the auth latch beside
it is life-long; this one is not that. The harness's own sandbox can refuse when *it*
spawns a tool subprocess long after the agent started fine, and a life-long latch would
let that make the next unrelated death permanently "your sandbox is broken". Clearing it
at the handshake — rather than only stopping the arming — is what makes every consumer
correct by construction: the three startup translations in `providers/acp.py` read it
before the handshake, and a per-turn path reached after it can only ever see `False`.

The error names the layer that wrapped the spawn, from `sandbox.wrapped_by_crew_sandbox()`
read off the argv the wrap returned — the wrap's own record of the branch it took, which
no re-derivation from mode + platform + settings can match, because the delegated branch
still falls back to Crew's seatbelt for a masked spawn and the audit-or-deny step can
refuse a delegation after it was chosen. Signature alone cannot decide it: a harness
sandbox nested inside Crew's wrap fails with the *harness's* wording while the layer to
change is *Crew's*.

**The switch that turns a layer off is emitted only on a corroborated verdict**, and
this is the security boundary of the whole path. The signature arrives on the dead
child's stderr, and that child is the unverified binary the sandbox exists to contain —
so answering it with `kirocrew config set agent.sandbox off` would let a planted binary
print one line and have Kiro Crew instruct the operator to remove the isolation it is
running under. This is the hazard `launcher_refusal` states for its own callers, and it
is answered the same way that function prescribes: `corroborate_launcher_refusal` re-runs
the real launcher around a trusted no-op under the refused spawn's own mode and masks,
and only *its* stderr — text no child wrote — unlocks the switch. Run off the event loop,
like the first-run gate runs it. Corroboration exists for Crew's Linux launcher only, and the
uncorroborated message says so rather than promising a verdict: on macOS the probe
validates an `(allow default)` profile against a fixed system binary while the real wrap
applies the strict generated one, so a passing probe is not evidence and pointing the
operator at it would false-green exactly the failure they are looking at. The message
names the layer, states that Kiro Crew has not confirmed the failure on this host, and
stops there until the real-wrap self-test lands.

Classification deliberately stops there. **There is no automatic fallback to an
unconfined spawn** — that would turn a broken host into a silently unsandboxed agent,
which this module refuses everywhere else too. The useful action is to fail fast and say
which layer to look at, loudly.

### XPIA Hardening (`security/` + `hooks.py`)

The hook-layer half of this section is reached at `hooks.py`, which stays the import
path and the patch surface; the rules it threads live in the modules of
`kiro_crew.hook_runtime` (`safe_reads`, `descriptor_identity`, `pinned_writes`,
`windows_paths`, `internal_reads`, `search_targets`, `denied_commands`,
`governance_gate`, and `tool_identity` for the title normalization and the
approve/deny pattern matchers), composed onto that module's globals. Which owner holds which rule,
and which constructs stay in `hooks.py` because a guard reads them there, is the "Hook
runtime owners" table in [memory-skills-hooks](memory-skills-hooks.md).

External mapped skill reads preserve their enumeration-time canonical admission
root through the shared no-link reader (`within_root_is_canonical=True`). The
reader compares the opened descriptor against that snapshot rather than resolving
a replacement root. This protects mapped metadata and indexed/direct bodies;
other callers retain the existing default root-resolution contract.

The shared file readers authorize the opened regular-file descriptor before
consuming bytes. Its kernel path must match the validated name and pass the
sensitive-path gate. On macOS only, a case-only mismatch may pass when a
component-by-component no-follow walk of the already validated name opens the
same `(st_dev, st_ino)` as the held descriptor. Case folding selects a candidate;
it never grants access on its own. Different inodes on case-sensitive volumes,
missing names, swapped links and unavailable identity witnesses refuse the read.
The original descriptor supplies the bytes; the comparison descriptor is closed.
The candidate test is `str.casefold` equality of the two spellings, nothing
wider: a spelling that differs only by Unicode normalization (an NFC name whose
kernel witness reads back NFD, or the reverse) is not a candidate and stays
refused, because normalization equivalence is a filesystem property the reader
does not model and admitting it would widen the exception beyond exact case.
Windows keeps its existing `os.path.normcase` lexical comparison, which folds
case before this branch, so the macOS walk is never reached there.
For bounded no-hardlink reads and both containment checks of pinned replacement
(the source file and its staging parent), a macOS containment mismatch pins
the resolved root without following links and compares its kernel pathname with
the opened descriptor's kernel pathname. No folded-prefix containment is used.
Hardlink, regular-file, sensitive-path, byte-limit and staged-rename identity
checks retain their existing contracts. The reader's one hardlink exception is
opt-in per call (`admit_hardlinked`) and decided on content: a hardlinked inode
still passes every other check, is never returned truncated, and is returned only
when the caller's callback accepts the exact bytes read. Its single caller is the
global skill-body reader, which accepts an installed package `SKILL.md` whose bytes
match the distribution `RECORD` digest
([memory-skills-hooks](memory-skills-hooks.md)); every other caller, and every
agent-writable root, keeps the plain refusal. The kernel may name ANY link of a
multi-link inode (macOS `F_GETPATH` returns a sibling about one read in a hundred),
so for `st_nlink > 1` a name that differs from the validated path is not on its own a
swap: `_hardlink_alias_matches` walks the validated name through a pinned parent with
no link followed and admits only when that walk lands on the descriptor's inode. The
sibling's name is still screened as sensitive, and containment under `within_root` is
then judged on the validated name. A single-link inode keeps the strict name
comparison. Linux names the descriptor by the link it was opened through, so
that branch is not reached there in practice; Linux and Windows otherwise retain their existing
pathname and no-reparse checks. SEL event schemas are unchanged.

The outbox notify and download handlers run path resolution, containment and
the complete descriptor read on the existing bounded path-transfer pool. Pool
admission exhaustion returns the shared audited `503 path_probe_busy` response.
Cancellation does not transfer an open descriptor to the coroutine: the worker
closes it even if its waiter has left. A wedged syscall can occupy that worker
until the kernel returns, but cannot occupy the event loop or the default pool.
Other path-resolution and read failures retain their existing refusal contracts.

This alias repair covers the shared readers and pinned replacement only.
Cron script vetting, workflow inventory, private-memory reads, feature-video
cache paths and spec-builder directory writes have separate authorization
contracts and retain their existing lexical descriptor checks.

**Sensitive path protection** — blocks at the hook layer before tool execution:
- `is_sensitive_path(path)` — checks `fs_read`/`ReadFile` targets against sensitive dirs
- `is_sensitive_resolved_path(resolved)` — the same decision for a path the CALLER has already canonicalised (`os.path.realpath` on its own worker thread). Same targets and the same TTL target cache, with no `mc-pathres` submission on either half: the candidate is matched lexically, and the anchors are resolved inline on the calling thread (`_home_dir_targets(inline=True)`, the stance `sandbox_credential_targets` already takes off the loop; mechanically, a `realpath` asked for with no `_run_resolution_bounded` deadline armed on the thread runs in this interpreter -- `_outside_bounded_call` -- and never reaches the child pool, so an unbounded caller can neither hold a child to the pool's ceiling nor queue ahead of the loop) — still fresh on every call and still keying the cache, so a repointed root still invalidates. A wedged mount blocks that thread instead of raising a stall, which is what its own `os.walk` on the mount does anyway; nothing is admitted while it blocks. **For two shapes of caller only**: a bulk walk on a worker thread that already resolves every entry to detect link loops and prove containment (`skills._iter_skill_files`, one call per directory and per `SKILL.md`), and a reader that has just canonicalised its own path, which asks through `is_sensitive_canonical_path(resolved)` -- the entry point that probes the calling thread itself, answering with this gate off the event loop and with `is_sensitive_path` on it, so a caller earns the off-pool gate by offloading and never by declaring anything (the artifact store's file helpers, with `GET /api/artifacts` running `store.list()` on a worker so the listing takes this gate, and the agent-spec readers `agent_discovery._read_agent_spec` / `read_agent_spec_strict`, which the native skill projection runs under `asyncio.to_thread`). Why it exists: the pool is sized for the event loop (two workers by default, FIFO; `KIROCREW_PATH_RESOLVE_WORKERS` widens it), and the walk issued ~1.4k calls per scan on an install with a few provider packages, each a candidate resolution the walk had already performed plus an anchor resolution; every one queued ahead of the loop's own latency-critical resolutions, and eight of eight loop-stall dumps on one host showed the loop parked in `Future.result` behind that backlog — none of the individual waits crossed the 2 s budget, so the stall breaker never tripped. Handing this gate an unresolved spelling is a link bypass, and calling it from the loop forfeits the bound, which is why it is a separate name and not a flag on `is_sensitive_path`; `test_pathres_loop_starvation.py` pins that the walk passes only `realpath` output and that neither half reaches `_run_resolution_bounded`
  - **The anchor cache's expiry tracks what the rebuild COST, not a constant (#10255).** The rebuild is ~130 `realpath` calls and every syscall hands the GIL over, so its cost is set by CPU contention rather than by the disk: measured on a 64-core Linux host with one local xfs mount and a 5 ms switch interval, 2 ms on an idle interpreter and 581 ms / 399 ms / 3859 ms / 7456 ms with 1 / 2 / 4 / 8 sibling threads running pure Python. Those are one sweep of `scripts/measure_path_gate_ttl.py rebuild` and are not a contract: the absolute figures move between sweeps on the same host (the PR that introduced this quotes a different one, 647 / 870 / 2760 / 3906 ms), and the ORDER of magnitude against load is the finding, so a re-derivation landing other numbers is not a regression. The shipped 0.1 s expiry was sized against the idle figure, so it spent ~2% of the wall clock rebuilding there and a rising share under load, until the rebuild missed `_PATH_RESOLVE_REBUILD_TIMEOUT_SECS` and the gate refused ordinary project files with a healthy filesystem throughout — the reported defect. `_home_targets_ttl` therefore returns `clamp(cost * _HOME_TARGETS_TTL_COST_RATIO, _HOME_TARGETS_TTL_SECS, _HOME_TARGETS_TTL_MAX_SECS)`: the ratio (50) is the reciprocal of the share of the wall clock the gate may spend rebuilding, so that share is held at 2% at every load level rather than only at the one the constant was picked on, and the rebuild's own duration is the load signal — no separate metric is read and nothing is configured per host. At idle the ratio lands exactly on the floor (2 ms x 50 = 0.1 s), so an unloaded host selects the same 0.1 s expiry it selects today. Only that duration is unchanged: because the expiry starts at the clock read taken AFTER the build, an entry's total age is the expiry plus the build that measured it, which for a 2 ms build is the same to within those 2 ms. Both inputs are operator knobs read once at import (`KIROCREW_PATH_GATE_TTL_COST_RATIO`, `KIROCREW_PATH_GATE_TTL_MAX_SECS`), each fail-soft to its reviewed default on an absent, unparseable or out-of-range value; a ratio of 0 pins one fixed 0.1 s expiry at every load level, which is the revert, and the ceiling accepts at most 300 s, which bounds the symlink-free case described next and nothing else: an install that resolved a target through a symlink is pinned to the floor by the flag below, so no env value reaches it. **The trade, and what keeps it off the install where it would bite:** a longer expiry would lengthen the window in which a symlink swapped DEEPER inside the crew home (a keystone leaf, or an intermediate directory on the way to one) is still answered from the stale set, the residual this cache always carried. So the build reports whether it traversed one. `_home_dir_targets_uncached` returns a `_BuiltTargets` set carrying `resolution_differed`, read off the resolve memo the build already filled: true when one of the paths the build RESOLVED came back spelled differently, which is exactly the resolution-derived entry a repoint can move out from under a cached set. **Which paths reach that memo is the flag's whole scope, and it is narrower than the target set.** The build resolves five classes of path and no others — `$HOME`, `KIROCREW_OS_HOME`, each entry of the CALLER'S `home_dirs` list that carries a crew prefix re-anchored under `KIROCREW_HOME`, each kiro-cli path in `_KIRO_CLI_WRITE_TIER_LEAVES` (the agents dir and the MCP registry leaf `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`) resolved under `$HOME` AND re-anchored under `KIRO_HOME` — one class because they share one rule — and each harness credential leaf re-anchored under its own home override — one entry on a host with no home override set and about eighty with every one set, against a few hundred built targets. Every other member of the set comes from `_anchor` or `_anchor_both_separators`, neither of which touches the filesystem, so the bulk of the set cannot report a traversal at all. **An ordinary symlinked dotfile under `$HOME` CAN set the flag, so a dotfile-managed home is a case to look for.** The trigger is the union the build resolves: a crew-prefixed entry of the caller's `home_dirs` under `KIROCREW_HOME`, a kiro-cli path under `$HOME` or `KIRO_HOME`, or a declared credential leaf under whichever harness variable relocates it. A symlinked `sessions` or `models` leaf under a `KIROCREW_HOME` below `$HOME` pins the write tier; a symlinked `goose` directory under whatever `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` resolves to pins the tier handed that leaf, because `.config/goose/secrets.yaml` is a declared leaf and goose declares that variable. A dotfile in none of those classes still cannot set it. Nor can the roots: `_resolve_root_anchors` canonicalises each root first, so the symlink has to sit BELOW the resolved root — relocating the exported config root itself does not trip it while a symlinked `goose` directory under it does, and the leaf resolved is `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/goose/secrets.yaml`, so a host whose `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` points somewhere other than `~/.config` can symlink `~/.config/goose` without any build resolving it. The LEAF-BEARING override roots are `KIROCREW_HOME`, `KIRO_HOME` and every variable in `host_auth.home_override_env_vars()`; `_OVERRIDE_ROOT_ENVS` carries one more, `KIROCREW_OS_HOME`, which is resolved as a root but bears no leaf class of its own; that table is the enumeration, and naming the variables or their count here would be a second place to forget the next harness — the documentation defect this section exists to remove. **The crew-prefix class is the caller's list, not a fixed set of leaves, so no one class of leaf describes the resolved population.** The crew-prefix arm loops over the `home_dirs` it was handed and resolves every entry carrying a prefix, and the three callers hand it three different lists: the read gate passes `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`, `is_sensitive_write_path` passes `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS + _WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS`, and `_is_keystone_publish_artifact` passes `_KEYSTONE_ARTIFACT_PARENTS`. So a symlinked write-protected crew leaf that holds no secret (`models`, `sessions`, `app-sources`) pins the WRITE tier just as a secret leaf pins the read tier, and the three builds can disagree on one host. Two consequences worth stating rather than leaving to be discovered: naming any single class ("credential leaf", or the secret leaf set) is wrong for at least one of the three lists, and because `_home_targets_pin_state` keys on the `home_dirs` list itself while `_report_expiry_pin` runs once per cache entry, a host whose builds disagree settles to one line per tier and both messages name the tier they describe — read a line as the state of the tier it names, not of the whole gate. `_home_targets_ttl` pins the floor whenever that flag is true, so the install where the stale-credential path is reachable keeps its 0.1 s window and does not grow one. Where no target resolved differently there is no such entry, and reaching the case at all would require first creating a symlink inside the crew home, a write `is_sensitive_write_path` refuses; the adaptive expiry applies in full there, which is the availability this is for. The flag defaults to true in two places (the class attribute, and the cache's own `getattr`), so a test double or a future builder that returns a plain `set` gets the floor rather than the long expiry. The roots cannot trip it: `_resolve_root_anchors` has already canonicalised every root, so a host whose `$HOME` is itself a symlink still earns the adaptive expiry. Neither reproduced bypass is widened either, because both repoint an *anchor* and every anchor is part of the cache KEY, so a repointed `$HOME` or `KIROCREW_HOME` re-keys and misses at any expiry; `test_repointed_home_symlink_is_not_served_from_cache_at_the_longest_expiry` pins that at the cap as well as at the floor. **What it does not fix, stated rather than implied:** an expiry controls how OFTEN the rebuild is paid, never what one costs, so past roughly four contending threads a single COLD rebuild already exceeds its own budget and every policy refuses alike — measured, and reproducible with `scripts/measure_path_gate_ttl.py`. Closing that case needs the resolution to leave this interpreter (#10256)
  - Concurrent inline callers coalesce target-cache rebuilds under an off-loop
    lock. Cache hits still resolve roots freshly, and a waiter resolves them
    again after acquiring the lock, so a root retargeted while waiting cannot
    select the old cache entry. The expiry starts AFTER the rebuild, not
    before it: an expiry started before a contended build has already elapsed
    when the build returns. Event-loop gates never acquire this lock and
    retain bounded resolution. Each build resolves identical leaf spellings
    only once; those resolutions do not survive the build. The canonical-path
    entry point skips atomic-artifact parent checks when the already-resolved
    filename has no supported artifact suffix; unresolved paths retain their
    full resolution checks.
- `path_contains_sensitive(dir)` — the **reverse direction**: True when a protected location lies UNDER the given directory (the home dir itself, or any ancestor of `~/.ssh`/`~/.aws`/the crew data home). For bulk operations rooted at a directory — e.g. the Notes builtin's `git add -A` over an attached vault (see [md-notebook.md](md-notebook.md)) — where `is_sensitive_path` on the root passes but the sweep would stage a credential store wholesale. List-based prefix comparison against the known sensitive roots (no filesystem walk, O(sensitive entries) on any tree size); shares `_candidate_forms` / `_home_dir_targets` with `is_sensitive_path` so the symlink/casefold/`KIROCREW_HOME` hardening cannot drift between the two directions
- **Symlink resolution (CWE-59)**: `is_sensitive_path()` resolves symlinks before matching — it checks multiple candidate forms (`os.path.realpath` + `Path.resolve`, plus the lexically-normalized path as a fail-safe when resolution can't complete) and returns True if ANY lands in a sensitive location, `casefold`-comparing against sensitive dirs anchored at BOTH the logical home and its realpath (defeats a home-prefix OS symlink like macOS `/var`→`/private/var`). So a workspace symlink pointing at `~/.aws/credentials` (absolute or `../../.aws/credentials` traversal) cannot be read through the link
  - **Resolution is bounded on BOTH halves of the check (liveness invariant).** The gate runs on the event loop, and `realpath` on a stalled automount or a disk saturated by antivirus scanning blocks in the kernel with no exception — two loop-stall crash dumps sat in exactly that frame for the full watchdog budget. Every `realpath` the gate performs therefore runs in a **child interpreter** of the dedicated resolver pool (`executors.path_resolve_executor`, a `subprocess_pool.SubprocessPoolExecutor` whose children run the stdlib-only `security/_child_realpath.py`; two children by default, and `KIROCREW_PATH_RESOLVE_WORKERS`, read once at import, sets the count -- an unparseable or out-of-range value keeps the default) through one shared core, `_run_resolution_bounded` (budget `_PATH_RESOLVE_TIMEOUT_SECS`, 2 s, plus a grace folded into the same deadline). A child rather than a thread because `realpath` is pure Python and reacquires the GIL twice per path component, so on a thread the budget was spent waiting for the interpreter, not the disk (#10255: measured 3.5 s for one six-component path beside 48 CPU-bound threads, against 81 ms in the child); and the round trip is made by the **calling thread itself** (`call_op`), never through a worker's future, because each extra thread handoff costs a switch interval under exactly that contention. The candidate is one request (`OP_REALPATH_SPELLINGS`); the root anchors are one batched request and the target rebuild one more (`OP_REALPATH_MANY`, ~130 paths in a frame), so a benign gate call is at most three round trips. A child that misses the deadline is **killed and respawned** (~11 ms), so a stall costs one refused resolution and never pins a worker -- and neither the reap nor the respawn lands on the caller: a child killed at its deadline is presumed wedged in an uninterruptible syscall, where SIGKILL takes effect only when the syscall returns, so the calling thread hands the process to the pool's reaper thread to `wait` on, and that thread also spawns the replacement before the next request needs it (the reaper is the only spawn site, so no `Popen` ever runs on the loop; a caller leases a ready slot or waits within its budget). Killed-but-unexited children (`_Unreaped`) are a respawn threshold of `2 * workers`: below it a slot respawns at once, so one permanently wedged mount cannot retire a slot for good; at it a slot stays empty and `call_op` refuses at once (`SubprocessPoolUnavailable`) instead of spending the budget on an empty queue (concurrent deadline arms can exceed the threshold by at most `workers`, so the pool holds at most `4 * workers` processes). The child runs source captured when the executor module loads (`-c`), never re-read from disk at respawn, so an edit to `_child_realpath.py` after start-up reaches no child. The resolver adds a caller-side guard for the same case: a re-probe of a prefix with stall history is refused, and that prefix's cooldown extended, while the pool is down to one serviceable child (`_pool_down_to_last_child`), so a known-bad mount never takes the last child; a child that dies, faults or answers out of frame (`SubprocessPoolUnavailable`) is refused fail-closed for that resolution with no cooldown charged, because an empty answer would read as "resolved, no other spelling" (a run of `_CHILD_FAULT_WARN_STREAK` consecutive such faults -- children that spawn but keep dying -- is warned about once and, from then until a child answers again, resolved through the same bounded in-process fallback the cannot-spawn arm uses, so a die-loop degrades the gate to load-shaped refusals instead of refusing everything; a healthy answer resets the run); and a host on which no child can be started at all falls back to in-process resolution with one warning. A stall opens a per-prefix cooldown (`_stall_prefix`: the mount point, first two components -- one more when the second is a container of homes such as `/local/home`, so the key is the user's home rather than every home on the host; base 30 s, doubling per repeat up to 30 min) during which paths under that prefix are not probed at all, so one wedged mount costs one timeout per window, never one per token or per rebuild. Not every missed budget is a stall, though, and two cases deliberately do **not** charge the prefix: a request no child ever took (every child leased for the whole budget -- a plain `TimeoutError` from the pool), and a child that was not blocked inside a stat syscall when the budget expired (it was on the CPU, not waiting on the mount). The pool samples `/proc/<pid>/syscall` of the child in the instant before it kills it and carries the token on `SubprocessPoolTimeout.child_syscall`; `_child_blocked_in_filesystem` reads it against a per-architecture table. The `/proc` STATE field cannot make that distinction — measured on a 48-core host, a thread doing ordinary `lstat` work and a thread doing nothing but burn CPU both alternate between `R` and `S` — but the syscall can: a process genuinely blocked in a kernel wait reports the same syscall on every sample, and a stat on a healthy filesystem completes in microseconds, so sampling one at all is evidence that this stat is not completing. **Unverified — the wedged-mount case is INFERRED, not measured.** No thread stuck on a genuinely wedged NFS, FUSE or CIFS mount has been observed reporting a table syscall, because no wedged mount could be produced in the measuring environment: an unprivileged FUSE mount and user-namespace creation both return EPERM, and `mount.nfs` is not installed. What WAS measured is three analogue kernel waits, each reporting one syscall with no other value observed — a pipe `read` (12 of 12 samples), a `clock_nanosleep` (12 of 12), and an `openat` on a writer-less FIFO, which blocks interruptibly on a real filesystem path, in state `S` with syscall 257 (15 of 15). Whether a wedged FUSE or CIFS mount, which waits in `S` rather than `D`, behaves the same is inference from those analogues and nothing stronger. This caveat stands until one measurement on a real wedged mount shows the stuck resolver thread reporting a table syscall stably, or the table is corrected from what it reports. The timing-out call still fails closed in both exempt cases; what is withheld is only the generalisation from one thread to the whole subtree, which is what turned ordinary CPU contention into a cooldown refusing every scheduled job under the prefix. The event-loop bound survives that exemption rather than being removed by it: at most `_PATH_RESOLVE_LOAD_MAX_PROBES` (3) uncharged load-arm probes are allowed per prefix per `_PATH_RESOLVE_LOAD_WINDOW_SECS` (10 s) window, and the next one opens the cooldown normally, so a many-token call on a loaded host still cannot pay the budget once per token. That count is cleared only by the window expiring, never by a successful resolution — it measures event-loop time already spent, which a later success cannot refund, so an alternating success/timeout run cannot evade the bound. The two halves react to a stall differently, on purpose:
    - **Candidate** (the agent-supplied path, `_resolved_forms_bounded` → `_candidate_forms`) — **fail-closed**: `PathResolutionStalled` makes every gate refuse the path. A lexical-only match here would pass a workspace symlink into a credential store for the length of the stall.
    - **Anchors** (`$HOME`, the `KIROCREW_HOME`/`KIRO_HOME`/adapter override roots, and the keystone leaves under them — `_resolved_root_key` via `_resolve_root_anchors`, and the rebuild in `_home_dir_targets_uncached` via `_rebuild_targets_bounded`) — **the same fail-closed rule**. The gate only compares against anchors resolved fresh, canonically, within the budget; a stall, an open cooldown, a pinned or faulted pool all raise `PathResolutionStalled` and every gate refuses, exactly as for a candidate. Three weaker fallbacks were each found open in review and are pinned shut by tests: lexical spellings (a symlinked override root on another mount loses its canonical target, and a request naming that canonical path resolves cleanly on its own healthy prefix and passes), a Windows UNC skip (same hole via a junction inside a UNC home — the `_is_unc_path` shortcut is therefore candidate-token-only, and a UNC *home* is probed), and serving the previous canonical resolution through a stall (a symlink repointed during the stall moves the credential out from under the stale anchor). The one lexical spelling that remains is pre-existing: an override root whose own `realpath` raises `OSError` keeps its verbatim absolute form (`_lexical_root`, not `abspath`, so a trailing space survives on Windows). `_resolved_root_key` runs once per `is_sensitive_path` call, so all six roots resolve in ONE pool hop rather than six, and the whole rebuild is one job rather than one per leaf. `sandbox_credential_targets` (the OS sandbox deny mask, already run off the loop by `_sandbox_preflight`) resolves the roots through `_resolve_root_anchors` with no bounded-call deadline armed, so they resolve in this interpreter and never reach the child pool (`_outside_bounded_call`, above); a wedged mount blocks that preflight thread rather than raising `PathResolutionStalled`, and the bound on it is `_run_preflight_bounded`'s (`acp/client.py`) 60 s `wait_for`, whose expiry raises the retryable `AcpError` naming the slow disk — the enforced adapter is refused, never started with its mask missing, and the spawn's own exception ladder never sees the resolver's class. The `file_grep` ripgrep exclusion list derived from the same function runs on a transfer worker with the same inline routing; its argv build deliberately catches nothing, so should a stall ever be raised there it propagates as the `RuntimeError` `_grep_rg` already catches, which routes the search to the fail-closed python engine rather than running ripgrep with an empty exclusion list.
- `is_sensitive_bash_command(cmd)` -- the shell-command gate. It has exactly three tiers: the size ceiling (`MAX_SCANNABLE_COMMAND_CHARS`, 20 KiB; a longer command is **refused**, never scanned partially or let through unscanned), the IMDS check (`exfil._check_imds_access`, every IP encoding), and the environment-credential exfiltration check (`denied_rules._check_env_credential_access`: `declare -p`, `env | grep`, `printenv`, ...). Each refusal carries a `refusal_diagnostic` naming the rule id and matched span.
- **The gate does not match PATHS in command text.** No fence-literal matcher, no relative-traversal matcher, no separator-run collapse, no assignment resolution, no `cd` re-rooting, no home-entry scan and no traversal simulation run on a shell command. A command naming `~/.aws/credentials`, `../../.ssh/id_rsa` or the governance keystone is not refused by this gate; what stops it is the OS sandbox (`sandbox.wrap_argv` mounts the keystone read-only in every sandbox mode and bind-masks the credential stores away from the agent process tree in the stricter tiers -- `standard` deliberately leaves `~/.aws` visible so `credential_process` can reach it, as the residual at the end of this entry states) and, for the file tools, `is_sensitive_path` on every resolved path they open. The tool gate's path tier follows the same rule for exactly one string: `hooks.on_tool_call` and the `_resolve_permission` title and tool_input tiers do not hand a SANDBOXED shell tool's recovered COMMAND (`AcpEvent.shell_command`, and the title when it is that text with or without its display prefix) to `is_sensitive_path`. The switch is the client's own classification and recovery, never the payload's: `is_shell`, a recovered command, AND no `mcp_server_name`, because kiro-cli can classify an execute-kind frame as shell while also naming an MCP server (`classify_tool_call` carries the identity and keeps the shell verdict), and an MCP-served tool runs outside the sandbox this exemption leans on. Every OTHER string of a shell frame stays path-gated: a shell-kind tool with structured parameters (kiro-cli `use_aws`) can carry a discrete credential path as an argument, and in `standard` mode `~/.aws` is visible to the shell, so the path tier over that argument is the control there, not the sandbox. Resolving a command line as a filename never matched, but it cost a resolver round-trip per shell call and, under a resolver stall, refused the command as `access to sensitive path: cd /x && grep ...` -- a non-path named as a credential. The one thing this gives up is a shell tool whose recovered command is a bare path, which is command text all the same and is left to the sandbox. `scripts/deny_diff.py` and the security-conductor `verify_fix.py` classify the SHELL corpus, so their composites carry the other three tiers and not this one. The text passes that used to stand in for those controls refused ordinary read-only commands (`grep -r pattern .`, `cd <worktree> && cat ...`, a heredoc carrying backticks) far more often than they caught an access the sandbox did not already stop, and a regex over a shell command cannot be made complete -- every closure of a spelling gap opened another. Reads of the keystone are therefore not blocked at the bash layer; writes are, by the sandbox. Pinned by `TestTheBashGateMatchesNoPaths` in `test/test_security.py` together with the IMDS, env-cred and size-ceiling refusals it keeps. The deny-rule catalog carries no credential-PATH row either: the `sensitive-file-read` category (`.*cat.*/\.aws/.*` and siblings) was a command-text path regex under another name and is gone for the same reason, so `cat ~/.aws/credentials` from a shell is refused by no text layer: in `strict`/`cc` the sandbox hides `~/.aws`, and in `standard` -- which deliberately leaves `~/.aws`, `~/.ssh` and `~/.kube` visible so kiro-cli's own credential resolution works -- it is not refused at all. That residual is stated, not hidden behind a matcher that closed one spelling.
- **Cron script bodies are not shell subjects.** `mcp_cron._vet_script_contents` scans a script body with whole-body, source-aware, linear detectors only: a credential-path spelling anywhere (`_CRON_CRED_PATH_RE`), a protected secret env var by `$NAME` or bare name, and an exfiltration URL (`scan_exfiltration_urls`), under its own size ceiling (`MAX_SCANNABLE_SOURCE_BODY_CHARS`, 256 KiB, aliased by `_MAX_SCRIPT_SCAN_BYTES`; the reader probes one byte past it so an oversized body is refused rather than vetted on a prefix). It does NOT call `is_denied` or `is_sensitive_bash_command`. Between #4243 and #8811 the body WAS handed to the shell gate, and every shell-grammar pass produced a class of permanent false denial on ordinary scripts: separator-run collapse read `re` escapes as paths (#7912), the traversal passes counted every line as a pipeline stage and refused any ~512-line script on the stage budget (#8563), the ordered-existence env rules assembled an `env | grep` pipeline out of an `os.environ` read, a `|` in a regex literal and a comment hundreds of lines apart (#8563), and the `find` pass parsed an English docstring opening with "Find …" as a command line (#8643). Each was closed by a further layer of AST analysis (`is_sensitive_source_body`, ~1500 lines) that still could not tell `open(a + b)` from `re.compile(a)` and did not stop `open(os.environ["LOCALAPPDATA"] + r"\\kiro-cli\\config.json")`. Static text analysis of a Turing-complete body is not a fence, so that layer was removed. The runtime control for what a script may OPEN is the sandbox `run_script` spawns it in (`wrap_argv` bind-masks the crew home's credential leaves, the vault and the keystone in `cc` mode, and strict mode for a secret-granted run); the body scan stops the obvious register-a-malicious-script case and nothing more, and the `cron_add` approval prompt covers destructive-op risk. **Ratchet**: `test_script_body_is_never_a_shell_gate_subject` (cron) and `test_the_shell_gate_has_no_source_body_entry_point` (liveness) pin that the shell gate's signature is `(command, *, enabled_ids)` and that no source-body entry point exists. Do not re-couple them: a new detector for scripts belongs in `_vet_script_contents` as a whole-body match, or in the sandbox.
- **No indirection is resolved, and that is the boundary rather than a gap.** The matchers that briefly did — an assignment-resolved view, a `/./` collapse, a `cd` re-rooting onto the trust root, a welded redirect prefix — are gone, and the reason is structural rather than a scope judgement. This gate reads command TEXT, while a spawned shell reaches a file through an `open()` that never routes through the tool gate, so `sandbox.py`'s own note is decisive: a path fenced only here "is readable through any sandbox mode". Six review rounds demonstrated the consequence empirically by producing a new spelling every time (`V=$HOME`, brace expansion, `find -exec`, an argument-position assignment, `/./`, a glued `>leaf`, an assignment feeding a `cd`, a conditional reassignment, glued statement boundaries, `pushd`); each closure narrowed an unbounded set by one. **What bounds a subprocess is the OS layer**, which gives every crew-home leaf one of three dispositions: `HIDDEN` (bind-masked in every mode — the credential homes, `.env`, `live_target.json`), `READONLY` (read by in-sandbox code, never writable — the governance ceiling, so the agent cannot choose its own ceiling in any mode), or `VISIBLE` (needs read and write in-sandbox, so it rests on the tool gate alone). The `pi-gate` leaf is `READONLY`: the pi backend's `adapter_hidden_credential_dirs` exclusion lets its child execute the launcher and read the sealed extension, while the same floor-derived mask still hides `run/gateway-<port>.secret`; the file-tool floor fences both leaves. It is precreated and no-follow pinned exactly like `playwright-cli`, so the directory is a read-only mountpoint before any sandbox starts rather than a writable name on every install that has not run pi yet, and `_materialize_sealable_ceilings` treats it as it treats every other entry — no per-adapter branch, so an unsafe state refuses the spawn. `acp.client._pi_gate_artifact_dir` re-checks the same states (dangling symlink, symlink to a directory, regular file, wrong mode) on the pi spawn path before the sandbox is built, so a pi session refuses with a message naming the directory it resolves. The residual this leaves is that a squat at the leaf refuses any backend's spawn, not only pi's; it is the shape the adjudicator judged human-acceptable, in preference to conditioning a shared seam on one adapter. `test_sandbox_governance_mask.py` pins the union of the three equal to the crew-home half of `sensitive_home_dirs()`. Two residuals follow directly and are stated rather than matched around: `READONLY` permits the ceiling READ by design (masking a policy file resolves it to the permissive standalone default, which removes the ceiling instead of protecting it), and `sel_hmac.key` is `VISIBLE`, so the SEL audit key has no OS fence and no bash-layer fence either (`is_sensitive_path` still refuses it on the file-tool path). Closing that means moving its in-sandbox reader behind the gateway so the leaf can become `HIDDEN`, never another matcher.
- **Bounded cost (liveness invariant).** The gate runs synchronously on the event loop under the 25 s loop-stall watchdog, so its worst case is the gateway's worst case. Every remaining matcher is linear in the subject, and `MAX_SCANNABLE_COMMAND_CHARS` turns that into a wall-clock ceiling. The IMDS and env-cred tiers stay `O(k*n)` in the count of verb tokens and are bounded by the ceiling (<= 60 ms at 20 KB).
- `hooks.on_tool_call` runs **both** `is_sensitive_path` and `is_sensitive_bash_command` on the **normalized** tool title regardless of the kiro-cli `Reading: `/`Running: ` display prefix, and then the deny-rule catalog on the raw command. The claude-agent-acp adapter sets a file-read tool's title to the bare path and a Bash tool's title to the bare command (no prefix), so gating either check on the prefix would let credential reads through on an alternate ACP backend. `is_sensitive_path` resolves the title as a path (a bare `~/.aws/credentials` matches; `cat ~/.aws/credentials` resolves to a non-sensitive path and passes every text layer; whether the read then succeeds is decided by the sandbox mode, see the shell-gate bullet).
- **The cron in-flight markers are fenced because the breaker ACTS on them.** `cron-running` (`cron_inflight.RUNNING_DIR_NAME`) is on `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` beside `crons.json` and `cron-history`. The reason is sharper than for the store itself: one marker whose PID matches a cron-surface loop-stall dump is what makes `CronService.start()` park that job, so a marker an agent could write is an unauthorized "pause this job" primitive that routes around both the MCP cron tools and the owner-only HTTP surface, and a marker it could delete disables the breaker for a crash loop that is about to recur — the evidence an automatic state change rests on has to be at least as protected as the state it changes. The whole DIRECTORY, so the claim file (`.loop-stall-breaker`), the attribution record (`.loop-stall-attribution`) and any write temporary are covered by one rule. The cron service and `kirocrew doctor` open it directly rather than through this gate, so both keep working, and nothing legitimate reads a marker through a file tool. Beneath the fence `cron_inflight` still refuses what it did not write — a linked (symlink or junction) `cron-running` is neither read from nor written to, children open `O_NOFOLLOW`, single-linked regular files only, size-bounded reads, and `atomic_write(restrict_to_owner=True)` for every write — so a leaf planted before the fence existed is not followed either, and a `read_text` can never block the worker `start()` awaits.
- **Off-loop scan in `_resolve_permission`** (the funnel every streamed permission request on cron, Slack, dashboard side-panel and workflow turns goes through): the always-enforced title tier (`is_sensitive_path`, `is_sensitive_bash_command`, `is_denied` on the title) and the tool_input tier (`_first_tool_input_denial` over every string in the payload) run in ONE `asyncio.to_thread` hop, title first, so a request denied on its title reports the title-tier reason and the `always_deny` mechanism, and a request denied on a payload string reports `always_deny_input`. CPython's `re` HOLDS the GIL for the whole of one match call (measured with a tick-counting probe whose clock starts before the worker does: a 5–8 s `search` on a worker leaves the main thread a single tick on 3.10 and 3.12, the same shape as `sorted()` on a large list, while `zlib.compress` — which does release — leaves it ticking), so the hop does NOT keep the loop live inside one scan; the liveness guarantee within a scan is the linear patterns plus `MAX_SCANNABLE_COMMAND_CHARS`, and what the hop buys is the realpath I/O inside `is_sensitive_path` (which releases the GIL) and a yield between the tool_input strings. A ~9 KB shell title scanned inline on the loop was the field crash that motivated this; `hooks.on_tool_call` (HOOK_BASED policy, and the other channel dispatchers that call it synchronously) still runs inline and relies on the gate's linear cost and `MAX_SCANNABLE_COMMAND_CHARS` ceiling for its liveness bound.
- **A file EDIT's tool_input is a document, gated by its target path.** An edit's `tool_input` is the unified diff `acp._dispatch.derive_edit_diff` renders from the new file content, so scanning it with the shell-command predicates read prose as a command line: writing a page that says `git push origin main` or a docstring naming the gateway-restart command was refused by the `is_denied` regex rules, and any body over `MAX_SCANNABLE_COMMAND_CHARS` was refused for its length (#8812, the same class #9082 closed for cron script bodies). `_resolve_permission` routes an edit through `_edit_target_denial` instead, but only on client-derived provenance, never on the payload's own `kind` (agent-influenced): `tool_kind == "edit"` AND `shell_classified` with `is_shell` False (the shell cache the preceding tool_call frame populated) AND `raw_params_trusted` (params from that same cache, not an inline fallback). A shell call that forges `kind="edit"` still carries the cached `is_shell=True` and keeps the command scan. Then: the target set is the UNION of every accepted path spelling in the params (`platform.tool_paths.target_paths`) and the path the tool_call's `{"type": "diff"}` content block named (`_dispatch` caches it per scoped toolCallId in `diff_path_cache`, beside the params/shell/identity caches, and `build_permission_event` carries it as `event.diff_path`), because a backend may stream trusted params with no path key and name the file only in that block. Every candidate goes through `is_sensitive_write_path`, the read+write keystone plus the write-only tier; a truncated walk is denied as unverifiable, mirroring `hooks.on_tool_call`; and an EMPTY union is denied outright (`Blocked: file edit names no target path to verify`) rather than falling back to the document scan, since a document that happens to contain no denied text is not evidence that the write is safe. The title tier still runs first; an edit with no params at all (no `raw_params_trusted` to earn) keeps the document scan unchanged. Pinned by `test_llm_helpers_edit_gate.py`.
- **Every other non-shell tool with client-established provenance gets a FIELD-SCOPED scan, and only a built-in document writer has its body keys skipped.** The same three predicates run over the trusted params (`event.raw_tool_params`, the strings that execute) through `platform.tool_paths.command_shaped_strings`, which walks every string EXCEPT one sitting directly under a key in `DOCUMENT_BODY_KEYS` (`content`, `fileText`/`file_text`, `text`, `newStr`/`oldStr`, `new_str`/`old_str`, `newText`/`oldText`) — the body of a file write, the two halves of a replacement, the new text of an insert. Every key names a producer: the kiro-cli file tool's arguments plus the three content keys `acp._dispatch._EDIT_CONTENT_KEYS` reads, the ACP diff block, and the Anthropic text-editor tool shape; the claude-agent-acp backend's tools are not listed because their frames carry no `_meta.kiro.toolName` and so never reach the exemption; a key with no producer is not on the list, because an unused exemption is an exemption waiting for a producer nobody vetted. A body is prose or source, and reading it as a shell command line refused a write that merely QUOTED `rm -rf /` or named a credential path, and refused any body over `MAX_SCANNABLE_COMMAND_CHARS` for its length. Scope is decided by provenance the client derived from the tool_call frame, never by the payload's own `kind` or by the tool's title: `shell_classified` with `is_shell` False (a shell tool keeps the full scan over every string, because for it `command` IS what executes, and body keys are not exempt there), `raw_params_trusted` (params from the tool_call cache, not the inline fallback), `mcp_identity_trusted` (the `_meta.kiro` tool-name and server caches HIT, so the resolved name is the client's, not the payload's), and the resolved name being a BUILT-IN document writer per `platform.tool_paths.is_document_writing_tool` (`DOCUMENT_WRITING_TOOLS`: the kiro-cli file tool under both of its names, `fs_write` and `write`, with an empty MCP server name; the claude-agent-acp backend's tools are not listed because their frames carry no `_meta.kiro.toolName`, so the client never caches a name for them; an operation word such as `create`/`strReplace`/`insert` and the ACP kind `edit` are not tool names and are not listed, since a row the cached `_meta.kiro.toolName` can never equal matches nothing). An MCP tool is never scoped by `DOCUMENT_BODY_KEYS`, whatever it names its fields: a server-side tool can execute the text it calls `content`, so the client cannot know from the shape that the field is inert. The one exception is an explicit `platform.tool_paths.MCP_DOCUMENT_BODY_FIELDS` row, keyed by the cached `(server, tool)` identity and admitted only for a core-server tool whose handler keeps the field as non-executable document text: today `("kirocrew-core", "knowledge_add_document")` with `content`. Its bar is the built-in scoping's minus `shell_classified`: `is_shell` False, `raw_params_trusted`, and `mcp_identity_trusted` (the cached `_meta.kiro` server AND tool pair, never the permission payload). The shell-cache hit is not required because kiro-cli's MCP `tool_call` frame carries no `kind` (only its later updates do), so the cache is never written for a real kiro-cli MCP call; the trusted pair already names exactly what runs, and a frame that does report a shell kind still sets `is_shell` and is refused. KAS (`--agent-engine v3`) frames name the server in `_meta.kiro.serverName` and nest a deferred call's arguments under `arguments`, so no pair is cached there and the exemption does not apply (fail closed; tracked in #16727). Under that bar, the top-level body string keeps the size ceiling and the path tier but skips the command-text rules (`is_sensitive_bash_command` and `is_denied`, which carries the argv floor), because a stored page that mentions a product subcommand on its own line is not an attempt to run it; every other argument of that tool keeps the full scan. `mcp_document_body_keys` resolves the bare tool name or a qualified spelling whose qualifier names the same server, so a same-named tool on another server gets no exemption. Pinned by `test_llm_helpers_mcp_document_body.py` and, on captured kiro-cli 2.27.1 frames, `test_llm_helpers_mcp_document_body_real_frames.py`. A frame missing any one of those, or naming any other tool, keeps the full document scan (fail closed). The walk is a denylist rather than an allowlist: a `command` subcommand word, every path spelling (`is_sensitive_path` still refuses a credential path in a `path` field), a URL and any unlisted key still reach the scan; only a STRING directly under a body key is skipped, so a mapping under `content` is still walked and cannot hide a target; a walk that hits its node cap is denied as unverifiable (`Blocked: tool arguments too large to security-scan`), mirroring the edit gate. `assert_security_floor` and the ADD-only deny list are untouched — the same rules run, over fewer fields, for a narrower set of tools. Pinned by `test_llm_helpers_non_shell_gate.py`.
- Representative sensitive paths (the authoritative live tuple is `sensitive_home_dirs()`): `~/.aws`, `~/.ssh`, `~/.gnupg`, `~/.gpg`, `~/.config/gcloud`, `~/.azure`, `~/.docker/config.json`, `~/.kube/config`, `~/.npmrc`, `~/.pypirc`, `~/.netrc`, `~/.git-credentials`, `~/.kiro/crew/.env`, `~/.kiro/crew/sel_hmac.key`, `~/.kiro/crew/trust`, `~/.kiro/crew/security_events.jsonl`, `~/.kiro/crew/app_admission.json`, `~/.kiro/crew/workflow_library`, `~/.kiro/crew/run`
- **The refused-inbound spool is fenced as an OUTBOUND SOURCE (keystone directory `inbound-spool`).** `messaging/inbound_spool.py` persists a message the shutdown gate refused and, on the next start, posts a restart notice quoting it into the conversation it names (`docs/system-specs/modules/messaging.md`, "Durable inbound spool"). It holds no credential, and that is exactly why it is easy to leave off the floor: each entry names a conversation and carries text the notice quotes VERBATIM, so a file an agent could WRITE is a way to post text of its choosing, as the gateway, into any conversation still authorized for the principal it names — the `may_send_to` recheck narrows that to authorized routes, which is not a boundary — and an entry holds the verbatim text of a message the operator sent, so READ matters as much. Classified as the whole DIRECTORY on `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` (agent file tools, every shell form) and masked on `sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES` (spawned commands), for the reason the `whatsapp` and `apps/aws-control/data` entries are: the spool is written by atomic replace through a sibling temp, and the lock file beside it is what serializes two concurrent refusals, so fencing only the final leaf would leave a writable path to the same bytes. It is also pre-created empty at 0700 before every namespace spawn (`_CREW_PRECREATE_HIDDEN_DIR_LEAVES`) for the `crew-teams` reason: the store is created by its own first write, and `mount(2)` cannot mask a name that does not exist yet, so on a host where no inbound message has been refused the `isdir`-guarded mask loop skips the name and a sandbox spawned first can create the directory itself — a real directory holding a plain single-linked file, which the module's own link refusals accept. Materialising it changes nothing the spool relies on: both write sites tolerate finding the root present, 0700 is what its own owner-only writes require, and its readers open the leaf inside, so an empty root reads exactly as an absent one. The gateway opens all of it directly rather than through either gate, so spooling and the notice pass keep working. The generalizable rule this landed: **a store whose contents are later SENT on the gateway's behalf needs a credential's fences even though it holds none**, plus the egress authorization (`may_send_to`) re-decided at send time rather than trusted from the entry.
- **Crew data-home secret/trust-root leaves are covered under EVERY known home prefix.** Since the data home moved from top-level `~/.kirocrew` to `~/.kiro/crew`, each Kiro Crew secret / governance trust-root leaf (`.env`, `browser-cookies.txt`, `playwright-storage-state.json`, `sel_hmac.key`, `trust`, `security_events.jsonl`, `app_admission.json`, `security_policy.json`, `profiles`, `policy_cache`, `admission_policy.json`, `denied_commands.json`, `crons.json`, `cron-history`, `cron-running`, `workflow_library`, `appearance-library`, `oauth_endpoints.json`, `live_target.json`, `token_signing.key`, `refresh_chains.json`, `.local_secret`, `routing`, `run`, `tag-grants`, `crew-teams`) is expanded onto `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` under each entry of `_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES = (".kiro/crew", ".kirocrew")`. So the same leaf is read+write-blocked in (1) the current home `~/.kiro/crew` and (2) a not-yet-migrated pre-move legacy `~/.kirocrew`. A legacy `~/.kirocrew` no longer auto-migrates; it survives only in these deny lists, so a host that still has one keeps it read+write-blocked indefinitely rather than for the duration of a move. A new secret is added to `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` once and is covered in both locations.
- **Identity/auth SQLite store (keystone leaves `data.sqlite3` + WAL/SHM/journal sidecars)** — the store holds live bearer tokens, so a read impersonates the user against the model service and a write forges the identity rows. The kiro-cli and amazon-q copies are fenced by DIRECTORY (`identity_stores.fenced_home_dirs()`), which covers each store's sidecars and temporaries for free. The crew data home cannot be fenced that way — reading `config.json` and `sessions.db` there is routine and intended — so the store is named as a leaf on `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`, using `identity_stores.AUTH_SQLITE_DB` rather than a fresh literal so the fence cannot drift from the readers that resolve the same store, and the name is fenced before a writer for that location exists (the treatment `agentcore-inbound` gets). The `-wal`/`-shm`/`-journal` sidecars are named beside it because a file leaf matches its exact name only and a sidecar carries the store's credential bytes — `kiro_cli` states the same fact from the other side, that identity rows read as absent when the `-wal` sidecar is missing; `.tmp`/`.lock` publish artifacts in the same parent are already covered by `_KEYSTONE_ARTIFACT_SUFFIXES`. Scoped to the `_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES` entries and deliberately NOT matched by basename: `data.sqlite3` is a generic filename, so a basename rule would refuse an unrelated application database anywhere under the home directory. Every legitimate reader (`kiro_usage_api`, `kiro_cli`, `kiro_prerequisite`) resolves its path through `identity_stores` and opens it directly rather than through this gate, so no reader is affected. A `-name` traversal from an unfenced ancestor (`find ~ -name data.sqlite3`) names no path either half of the gate can match, and that is true of every keystone leaf rather than of this one. It is a stated residual of the bash gate, not a gap in this fence: the store is refused by `is_sensitive_path()` when the traversal's `-exec` actually opens it, which is where a resolved path exists to be checked.
- **Meetings owner-edit root.** `apps/meetings/data/edits` is a directory leaf on the same read+write sensitive floor. The minutes editor returns owner-authored text verbatim, so its sidecars may contain private corrections or credential-shaped examples; meetings agents must neither inspect them with `fs_read` nor overwrite them with `fs_write`. Keeping the root outside `meetings/<id>/`, then registering the whole directory, makes the existing hook gate the enforcement boundary and also protects atomic-write temporary siblings. The Meetings backend opens these files directly, so save, overlay, revert, and meeting deletion are unaffected.
- **SEL audit trust root (Talos finding cdf82704)** — `~/.kiro/crew/trust/sel_hmac.key` (the HMAC-SHA256 signing key for the tamper-evident audit chain, gated via the whole-dir `trust` entry; the legacy pre-migration `~/.kiro/crew/sel_hmac.key` leaf stays gated too) and `~/.kiro/crew/security_events.jsonl` (the audit log itself) are on the sensitive floor. The key lives in a dedicated owner-only `trust/` directory OUTSIDE the log's directory so write access to the log dir does not imply re-signing power. Without this floor an audited agent could `fs_read` the key and forge/rewrite the chain, or rewrite the log directly, erasing evidence of its own actions. The gateway's own SEL writer/reader (`sel.py`, `dashboard/session_health.py`) opens these files directly and does **not** route through `is_sensitive_path()`, so audit logging is unaffected. Residual: the key still lives in the agent's namespace; a deeper out-of-process signer (key never exposed to the agent) is documented future hardening.
- **App admission trust root (keystone invariant)** — `~/.kiro/crew/app_admission.json` (the sole fleet-controlled App Kit admission ceiling loaded by `apps/admission.py`) is on the sensitive floor, read- and write-blocked through the shared file gate. Because an **absent** policy falls open (admit), a governed agent that could `fs_write`/`tee`/`rm` this file could delete or neuter its own admission ceiling and re-admit a banned/unsigned app. Adding it to `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` also arms the bash write/extract matcher (`tee`/`rm`/redirect). The gateway's own loader (`apps.admission.load_app_admission_policy`) opens it directly via `path.read_text()` and does **not** route through `is_sensitive_path()`, so legitimate policy loading is unaffected.
- **Cron store (keystone leaf `crons.json`, #4812)** — the cron store holds access-control state, not just scheduling data: `session_key` decides which chat session may manage a job through the MCP cron tools and where its output is delivered, `approval_mode` is a per-job auto-approval decision, and `command`/`script` decide what gets executed on the host on a schedule. While the file sat outside the protected leaves, an auto-approved shell could reassign ownership, flip a job to auto-approve, or rewrite a scheduled job's command with an ordinary file edit — an open side door around the MCP tools' deliberate cannot-write-`session_key` rule and the `self-protection-cron-adopt` denied command, because those controls match command strings while the state lives in the file. The gap was a class, not a one-off: a command-string matcher cannot hold a file-backed invariant, so the structural control (the gate) is where the state lives now. Both `crons.json` and the `cron-history` sidecar directory (per-job records plus the index) are on `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`, read+write-blocked under every `_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES` entry on both the tool path and every shell form. The gateway's own writers (`CronService` via `atomic_write`, `CronHistoryStore`) open the paths directly and do **not** route through `is_sensitive_path()`, so scheduling and history are unaffected. Cost, accepted deliberately: a human hand-edit through an agent shell is now refused — the same trade-off every other keystone leaf makes; the store's malformed-entry tolerance still covers out-of-band edits made outside an agent session.
- **Saved workflow library (keystone directory `workflow_library`)** — a valid definition is executable source and its presence means the user explicitly promoted it into a durable named capability. Owner-only modes do not isolate a same-UID agent process, so leaving the records under an ordinary workflows directory would let an auto-approved file edit plant a definition that the library would list and run without the confirmation flow. The dedicated `<KIROCREW_HOME>/workflow_library/` directory is therefore on `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`, read+write-blocked for agent file tools and every shell form. Classifying the whole directory also protects atomic-write temp files. Run snapshots remain under the configurable `workflows.dir`; only explicitly promoted definitions use this fixed trust root. Dashboard and workflow-service readers/writers open it directly, so human listing, saving, editing, and invocation are unaffected.
- **Crew appearance library (directory `appearance-library`)** — the packs a user imported for crews to wear (`dashboard/appearances.py`). Only the gateway's owner-gated `/api/appearances` routes read or write it, and they open the directory directly, so putting it on `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` changes nothing for the dashboard. It is there because the sandbox bind-mask (`sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES`) covers only the Linux shell plane; on Windows and macOS the agent file tools are gated by `is_sensitive_path` alone, and an unlisted directory lets a prompt-injected `fs_write` rewrite a manifest or erase art the gateway then serves to every roster view. Recovery is a re-import, but corrupting user data is the mainline threat this list exists for.
- **Runtime exec dir trust root (run-marker sandbox-escape)** — the `run/` dir under the crew home is on the sensitive floor (under every `_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES` entry) because the gateway executes its contents **outside** the agent sandbox: the sandbox launcher scripts (`sandbox.py` execs `python <home>/run/kirocrew_sandbox_*.py`) and the remote-instance run-marker `gateway-<port>.bin` (`instances/run_marker.py`), whose recorded launcher path the SSH token-mint **and** the `restart_remote` action read and `exec` on the remote host. Without this floor entry a prompt-injected / sandboxed agent that could `fs_write` (or `tee`/redirect) a marker — or a launcher — into `run/` could point it at an attacker-controlled binary that the next routine token refresh or restart execs unsandboxed (owner + `-x` checks don't help; agent writes run as the same user) — a reachable sandbox escape. Classifying the whole dir also arms the bash write/extract matcher. The gateway's own writers (`instances/run_marker.write_marker` via `atomic_write`, and the sandbox launcher writer) open these paths directly and do **not** route through `is_sensitive_path()`, so gateway startup/spawn is unaffected.
- **Member memory path guidance (`memory_stores/`)** — built-in raw file tools
  guard managed member databases and their WAL/SHM sidecars against accidental
  edits. Trusted memory APIs resolve the canonical execution target and open its
  database directly with member/store integrity validation. This is not an OS
  confidentiality promise. Global V1's existing file-tool behavior is unchanged.
  The memory audit enumerates declared stores, labels every finding by store,
  and reports missing/unreadable V2 databases rather than treating them as clean.
  V2 facts, lessons and episodes are scanned from the one SQLite authority;
  there is no V2 JSONL fallback. V1's optional JSONL lesson tier keeps its own
  scan even without vectors: absent JSONL is allowed, unreadable JSONL reports
  `LESSONS_UNAUDITABLE`, and injection findings inspect both `rule` and `negative`.
  Manual/project source validation remains separate from learned-memory audit.

- **Live-target pointer (keystone leaf `live_target.json`)** — `~/.kiro/crew/live_target.json` decides which checkout the gateway `execve`s into at startup (Dev Fleet "Make live"), so a writable pointer is arbitrary code execution under the gateway's own identity, and a readable one tells an attacker which checkout to aim at. Added to `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`, so it is read+write-blocked under every `_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES` entry through the shared file gate. Only the dashboard owner's cutover action writes it — and it does so in the GATEWAY process (`dev_fleet/gateway_routes.py` → `live._make_live` → `live_target.write_target()`), never in the sandboxed Dev Fleet backend: that backend's build children share its namespace (a nested sandbox is denied by design), so a per-backend carve-out of this leaf would let a worktree's `npm ci` lifecycle script choose the gateway's next image. The OS mask (`sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES`) therefore covers the backend too; it reads pointer STATE (which checkout is live/staged, not the file) through `GET /api/apps/dev-fleet/live-target` with its own app token, and that token is refused on every write route. Because `mount(2)` cannot mask an absent path and the crew-home root is writable in-sandbox, the launcher materialises the file as its absent-equivalent `{"checkout": null}` (`live_target.NO_TARGET_DOCUMENT`) before every namespace spawn, so the mask is never vacuous on a host that has not pinned a target. The gateway's own startup reader (`live_target.maybe_reexec` called from `cli.py`) opens it directly rather than through the gate, so live-target resolution is unaffected. **The refusal has three user surfaces, all reading one sentence.** A pointer the mask cannot cover — a symlink of either kind, a non-regular file, or a second hard link — refuses the spawn (`SandboxCeilingUnsealable`), and the shapes that produce it are ordinary operation for a hard-link snapshot tool or a dotfile manager, so an operator meets it without having touched anything. The text is therefore built by the module-level formatters (`_live_target_symlink_detail`, `_live_target_irregular_detail`, `_live_target_multilink_detail`) and read by all three surfaces: the launcher's own refusal; `kirocrew doctor`'s *Live Target Pointer* section, which classifies the pointer BEFORE a spawn tries via `live_target_pointer_unfitness()` and is silent when fit (see [cli](cli.md), *Doctor Checks*); and `cli_chat._run_chat`, which prints the refusal as a message because it is deliberately outside the `AcpError` hierarchy and used to escape as a stack trace that read as a Kiro Crew crash. The dashboard's chat error card needs nothing extra — `_run_chat`'s terminal handler appends the exception's own redacted text — and the refusal does not classify as transient, so the retry ladder cannot absorb it into "Connection lost — retrying…" and leave the operator no reason at all. `test_live_target_pointer_visibility.py` pins each surface and asserts the launcher's exception CONTAINS the probe's sentence verbatim, so a paraphrase in any one of them fails rather than shipping two descriptions of one file. **All three surfaces print that sentence to a terminal, so the formatters defuse it where it is BUILT.** A symlink's target is attacker-chosen bytes handed back raw by `os.readlink`, and the party that plants the pointer is the sandboxed agent this masking exists to contain, so every interpolated value passes through `terminal_safe.safe_terminal_line` inside the formatter rather than at each sink — a surface added later inherits the escaping instead of having to remember it, and the stat-failure refusal on the same path is escaped for the same reason. `safe_terminal_line` and not `repr`: these sentences carry a path and a `find` invocation the operator is meant to COPY, so stripping OSC/CSI and C0/C1 controls (which leaves an ordinary path byte-identical) is right where quoting-and-escaping the whole value would reproduce the unusable fragments `_print_wrapped` avoids by never splitting a token. The escaping tests DISCOVER the formatters by name from the module, so a fourth unfit shape is covered without extending a literal list. An existing pointer that cannot be `lstat`'d propagates its `OSError` rather than answering fit, because `None` here means "nothing to report" and a pointer whose shape was never determined may still refuse every spawn; ABSENT is the one genuinely fit failure to stat, since the launcher publishes the absent-equivalent stub for it. The escaping is NOT confined to this pointer's three sentences: `cli_chat` prints any `SandboxCeilingUnsealable` verbatim, so every builder of that exception is a terminal sink, and every other builder that quotes a symlink's target reads it through the one helper `_symlink_target_display`, which returns it already passed through `safe_terminal_line` and renders the two values that have no readable target as `(unreadable)` (the link could not be read) and `(unprintable)` (the target was all control bytes, so escaping it leaves nothing) rather than an empty arrow the planter of the link would have chosen. Its callers are `_refuse_if_dangling_symlink`, `_refuse_if_symlink_leaf`, `_require_real_dir_nofollow`, `_require_real_file_nofollow`, `_refuse_if_aliased_protected_leaf` and `_refuse_aliased_masked_leaves`; the live-target pair reaches the same escaping through its own formatters instead. Each of them escapes the path, the `OSError` text and — for the strict file check — the caller-supplied `harm` and `remedy`, because `require_unaliased_launch_state` builds its remedy from the refused path itself (`_delete_file_command`), so escaping one half of that sentence would re-emit the bytes in the other half and print two different names for one file. **The sink is escaped as well as the builder**: `cli_chat` and `cli_cloud` both print `str(exc)` straight to a terminal, so escaping at each builder keeps a new SINK safe and escaping at each sink keeps a new BUILDER safe — neither half covers the other, and this list of builders is the ones that quote a link target, not every builder of the exception. `TestTheSiblingRefusalsAreDefusedToo` plants control bytes in a link target, a file name, a stat error and a remedy and asserts none reach any of those sentences or either sink. **One byte has two spellings and `safe_terminal_line` has to lose both.** A name read off the filesystem is decoded with the `surrogateescape` error handler, so an undecodable byte arrives as a lone surrogate rather than as the character — `0x9b` becomes U+DC9B, not U+009B — and the C1 class matched only the second spelling, which left the attacker-chosen one intact. Both ends of that are reachable from one value: a stream opened with `surrogateescape` (the default under C/POSIX locale coercion, so containers, systemd units and CI) re-encodes it to the raw `0x9b`, the 8-bit CSI; a stream on the default `strict` handler raises `UnicodeEncodeError` instead, so the caller crashes with a traceback where it meant to print a diagnosis — the very outcome the pointer's CLI surface exists to prevent. `_TERMINAL_CTRL_RE` therefore strips the whole surrogate range, not just the C1 part of it: the rest cannot drive a terminal but still cannot be encoded strictly, and a lone surrogate also arrives from JSON. The result is encodable by every handler, which is what "safe to print" has to mean, and the cost is that an undecodable byte is dropped rather than shown — it was never readable text. `test_terminal_safe.py` pins the property over the whole `U+DC80`-`U+DCFF` range rather than the three introducers that happen to drive a terminal. The multilink remedy is additionally `shlex.quote`d: a data home holding a space makes `find /opt/my data -samefile …` a two-directory search that answers a different question WITHOUT erroring, which is the worst failure shape for a diagnostic. It also STATES its own scope: the command searches the data home, while the tools that leave a link there (snapshot and backup runs, a dotfile manager) usually keep theirs elsewhere, so the sentence tells the operator to re-run from the mount point with `-xdev` when the local search reports only the pointer — a hard link cannot cross a filesystem but can sit anywhere on one, and a remedy that quietly searches the wrong subtree reads as proof there is no second link. Quoting applies to the already-escaped display text, so for the pathological case of a path holding a control byte the command is illustrative rather than runnable — a terminal that cannot be driven is worth more than a runnable line. Only the pointer's own symlink check runs on this path: it refuses a superset of what `_refuse_if_dangling_symlink` plus `_refuse_if_symlink_leaf` refused between them, and those helpers say "the masked directory", which names the wrong kind of thing for a JSON document. Full contract: the Dev Fleet spec, *Make Live → Pointer file*.
- **Agent tag-write grants (keystone directory `tag-grants`)** — `dashboard/chat_tag_grants.py` keeps both protected tag identity and per-tag agent-write policy for the `chat_tag` session directive AND for the `PUT /api/chat/slots/{slot}/tags` route (`chat_tags.api_chat_slot_tags`, which `chat_tag_assign` reaches) in the data-home directory `tag-grants` (`agent-tag-policy.json`, beside its store key `.signing-key`). The record IS the authorization and provenance: only a positively verified owner-dashboard browser create records a row (`none`/non-status for a plain label, `add-remove`/status for a workflow state), and PATCH may mint or change policy only when that row already exists. An authenticated internal agent/MCP create may still add a tag to the shared vocabulary, but that tag stays rowless and unprovenanced until the owner adopts it. A syntactically valid 12-hex id planted in agent-writable `tags.json` therefore cannot acquire authority through a later human status or policy toggle. Pre-existing custom tags without rows stay human-only until a separate dashboard-owner browser action adopts them with `none` policy and the status bit the owner saw; no migration reads identity from `tags.json`, and ordinary PATCH remains provenance-required. App, member, internal agent/MCP, unattributable, and body- or header-forged callers cannot invoke adoption. The whole DIRECTORY is on `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` (agent file tools, every shell form, read+write, under every `_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES` entry) and masked on `sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES`, and it is pre-created at 0700 before every namespace spawn (`_CREW_PRECREATE_HIDDEN_DIR_LEAVES`) because the store is created on first use and `mount(2)` cannot mask a name that does not exist yet. Only the gateway opens the path — owner-browser create and adoption mint identity, provenance-backed PATCH updates policy/status, delete revokes rows, the boot seed mints rows for the five code-constant default states only, and the applier (both the directive and the slot-tags PUT route) resolves from an installed snapshot — so nothing legitimate reads a grant through a file tool. The two appliers DIVERGE on a rowless (ungranted) tag by design: the `chat_tag` directive, a session tagging ITSELF, refuses adding any rowless tag (`none` policy) so a self-driving agent cannot invent labels; the slot-tags PUT route (`chat_tag_assign`), which also carries an app organising its OWN sessions, allows a rowless ORDINARY label (apps self-tag) but refuses a rowless tag whose vocabulary `status` bit is set (`status_identity_unprotected`) so a forged status cannot stack a workflow state. A future fold-up onto one shared gate must keep this split, not erase it. Owner-browser create, adoption, and provenance-backed PATCH share one write gate (`store_write_blocked()` after a refresh): each refuses unless the CURRENT store verifies, so a store missing after a failed quarantine reseed is never recreated from an empty document without its trusted defaults. Beneath the fence the schema-1 store defends itself: rows carry an HMAC provenance chain keyed under `token_signing.key`, an uncertified key or unverifiable document is quarantined (renamed aside, never deleted) and re-seeded rather than trusted, both files are read through a bounded regular-file reader, and every failure resolves to `("none", False)`. Quarantine and unreadability remain distinct from a deliberate human `none` policy. Authenticated `GET /api/chat/tags` preserves its list shape and decorates copied rows with coherent `agent`, `agent_provenanced`, and `agent_store_degraded` fields; none is persisted to `tags.json`.

- **Mirror admission (signed record inside agent-writable `session_map.json`)** — a dashboard-born session's mirror link records the peer it was admitted for (`ChannelLink.principal`) so the per-send recipient check can reach a roster a Discord DM channel id alone cannot answer ([messaging](messaging.md), § Proactive sends). `session_map.json` is not a keystone leaf: in-sandbox code reads and writes it, and no seal is added for this — widening what the sandbox masks is the operator's decision. The record is therefore SIGNED rather than fenced: the two paths that authorize a peer for a conversation (the dashboard mirror-link handler and the resume controller's pick commit -- exactly two minting sites, pinned by AST) store beside the peer an `admission`, HMAC-SHA256 over the canonical session key and the whole location (channel type, conversation id, thread id, peer) under a key derived from `token_signing.key` with a purpose label of its own (`kiro_crew.mirror_admission`), the same secret and the same construction the tag-grant store's key certificate rests on. `SessionMap.set_mirror_link` itself never mints one -- it carries the caller's bytes through verbatim -- and every rollback that re-sets a row it read back restores a peer only under an admission that still verifies (`mirror_admission.restorable_link`), so no writer can launder a planted row into a trusted one. The signing secret is masked from every agent plane (`sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES`), so a rewritten, moved or hand-assembled row cannot carry a valid admission; the ladder's recipient leg verifies with `hmac.compare_digest` and refuses, audits (`channel.mirror_admission`) and logs once for a row whose admission is absent or does not verify, and names the remedy (re-link, which mints a fresh record); the check refuses and never raises on a planted row of any shape (a non-string or non-hex admission, a non-string peer, fields of any type), because it sits on a dashboard turn's send path; both this audit and the rollback's `stripped_on_restore` keep the verbatim-stored SEL fields (`caller`, `source`) to in-tree constants and carry the row's ids only in the redacted `resources` field, since a credential planted in an agent-written `channel_id` must not reach the append-only log unredacted. A token-key rotation invalidates every admission at once, and such mirrors are refused until re-linked — fail-closed, the same posture the tag-grant quarantine takes. Scope: only rows that name a peer are signed; a key-named session's row records no peer, and the `channel_id` it stores is the pre-existing class tracked in its own issue. Stated residual: a row the gateway once signed for this session, location and principal can be replayed after an unlink — in-sandbox code that copied the signed row while the binding existed writes it back, and after a restart nothing contradicts it until the transport learns the DM's pairing; refusing it needs revocation state the agent cannot write back (#15358), the same agent-writable-row class, and sealing a store is the operator's sandbox decision (no new sealed leaf here).
- **Crewmate teams (gateway-only directory `crew-teams`)** — `crew_teams.py` keeps the owner's grouping of the roster (`teams.json`: `{version, teams: [{id, name, members}]}`) in the data-home directory `crew-teams`. Not a secret, but the record decides which team view a crewmate's questions and work roll up into, and the crewmates it groups are exactly the population that must not rewrite it. It is deliberately NOT under `trust/`: `trust` is a declared sandbox read-write exception, so a record there stays writable by a sandboxed command that builds the path at runtime (the `crew-panels` lesson). The whole DIRECTORY is on `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` (agent file tools, read+write, under every `_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES` entry), masked on `sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES`, and pre-created at 0700 before every namespace spawn (`_CREW_PRECREATE_HIDDEN_DIR_LEAVES`) because the store is created on the first team and `mount(2)` cannot mask a name that does not exist yet. A directory rather than the file so the `atomic_write` temp sibling is covered too. Only the gateway opens the path — the owner-gated `/api/teams` routes and the crew-delete hook — so nothing legitimate reads it through a file tool. Spec: [learn-cron-dashboard](learn-cron-dashboard.md), `handlers/teams.py`.
- **Channel routing state (keystone leaf `routing`, holding Teams' `teams_service_urls.json`)** — the store is DELIVERY ADDRESSING, not a secret: it maps each allow-listed Teams identity to the conversation that identity was last seen in, and `teams/transport.py`'s `resolve_configured_target` resolves an explicit `user:<upn>` send target through exactly that map. While the file sat outside the protected leaves, a prompt-injected agent with file-write access could point one operator's UPN at a different person's conversation and have the next cron result, subagent-completion notice or `send_message` delivered there. The two attestations on the inbound path do not close it: the JWT's own `serviceurl` claim binds the address only for the activity carrying it, `connector_host_allowed` re-checks the host wherever the Connector token is attached, and neither can distinguish one legitimate conversation id from another on a shared Connector host. Reading is fenced with writing because the file enumerates the operator's UPNs and the conversations they use. **A DIRECTORY leaf, not the file, and that is load-bearing:** a file leaf matches only its exact name, while `atomic_write` publishes through a `tempfile.mkstemp` sibling (`tmpXXXXXXXX.tmp`) in the same parent — so with the store loose in the data-home root an agent watching that directory could overwrite the temp file in the window before `os.replace` and have the rename publish its own routing. A directory entry covers every child, random temp names included; the same residual is why `trust`, `profiles` and `cron-history` are directories. Note the general form is NOT closed by this entry: a keystone leaf named as a FILE (`crons.json`, `security_policy.json`, …) still has an uncovered `atomic_write` temp sibling, which is a matcher-level question rather than a per-store one. `ServiceUrlStore` opens its path directly (`atomic_write` / `read_text`) rather than through the gate, so proactive routing across a restart is unaffected. There is deliberately no migration from the pre-`routing/` location: reading the old, agent-writable path would reopen exactly the hole this closes, and the store is a warm start that degrades to in-memory by design.
- **Computer-use primary enable (keystone leaf `computer_use.json`)** — the on/off switch for native desktop GUI automation (see [computer-use.md](computer-use.md)) is `~/.kiro/crew/computer_use.json`, added to `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` so it is read+write-blocked under every `_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES` entry on the tool path (`is_sensitive_path`), and sealed against every shell form (`>`, `tee`, `rm`, `tar -C` / `unzip -d` extraction into the trust root) by the OS sandbox rather than by command text: it is a `READONLY` leaf in `sandbox.py`, mounted read-only in every mode, and `is_sensitive_bash_command` matches no paths. **It is deliberately NOT in `config.json`**, and the precedent is the denied-command opt-out immediately below: `is_sensitive_write_path("~/.kiro/crew/config.json")` is `True`, but `is_sensitive_bash_command("echo x > ~/.kiro/crew/config.json")` is `None` and `is_denied(...)` is `None`, and before `config.json` was sealed at the OS layer (see the runtime-config bullet below) a `config.json` toggle was flippable by a prompt-injected agent through any redirect. A primary enable for full desktop observation plus input synthesis is a **security ceiling**, the same class as the deny opt-out, so it lives on the keystone. Reads fail soft to `{}` → **disabled**, and `is_enabled()` is a strict identity test against `True` (a hand-edited `"enabled": "false"` or `1` does not enable desktop control). The only writer is the dashboard PUT handler, which does not route through the agent tool gate; `enable_state.load_state()` opens the file directly, so legitimate reads are unaffected. The file carries no separate pointer opt-in: an earlier revision documented an `allow_pointer_move` flag (plus a `capabilities.computer_use_pointer` governance row) as a second consent gate for the one click path that warps the operator's REAL mouse pointer (`click_method: "global"`), and both were removed by product decision — `PolicyConfig.from_state` reads only `allowed_apps` / `extra_denied_apps`, so writing the flag has no effect and must not be re-documented without being re-implemented. That path is instead contained by requiring the model to NAME the method (`auto` never resolves onto it) and by a dedicated SEL `tool_kind` on every use.
- **Runtime config (`config.json`, `config.local.json`) sealed read-only** — both files are `READONLY` leaves in `sandbox.py` (and on `_CREW_PRECREATE_READONLY_FILE_LEAVES`, so the Linux mount seal has a file to bind before the overlay exists), not merely write-fenced on the file-edit tool path. They carry the switches that LOOSEN confinement: `agent.sandbox` (`"off"` skips Kiro Crew's own sandbox for every later spawn, after which the other read-only ceilings are writable), `agent.apps_allow_third_party` / `agent.apps_trusted` (admit app code the gateway runs in-process), `agent.sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec` and `agent.approval_mode`. The loader's load-time clamp neutralises an inflated number, not a loosened switch, and `is_sensitive_write_path` never sees a spawned shell's `open()`, so a writable file let an in-sandbox agent end its own confinement. Both are sealed because `KiroCrewConfig.load()` deep-merges the overlay over the base with the overlay winning; sealing one would leave every key writable through the other. Every legitimate writer runs outside the sandbox (dashboard config API, channel handlers, the gateway's boot default and write-back migrations, `kirocrew config` from the operator's own terminal). Inside the sandbox reads keep working, a load-time migration write-back fails soft (`Config write-back failed` warning), and `kirocrew config set` exits with a pointer to the dashboard (`cli_config._sandboxed_config_write_hint`). The `<leaf>.lock` sidecar is not sealed: it holds no setting. Residuals, both shared with every other `READONLY` leaf in this list: (1) on Linux the seal is a per-file bind mount, and every host writer publishes through `atomic_write` (temp + rename), which the kernel answers by detaching a mount whose file is renamed over from another mount namespace — so the seal holds from spawn until the next gateway save of that file, after which the name is unsealed in that sandbox until it respawns. That save is not only the operator's: the gateway also saves `config.json` on its own (boot migrations, member-identity publication and memory-store provisioning in `memory_stores.py`, the embedding-model stamp), and some of those paths an in-sandbox agent can reach indirectly through an ordinary tool call, so on Linux the agent can shorten the wait rather than only sit it out. macOS (Seatbelt, path-based) is unaffected. Closing this for all sealed leaves at once (one read-only directory instead of per-file binds) is tracked as a follow-up; until then, on Linux, saving a setting during a session reopens the pre-seal exposure for that session. (2) A symlinked or hardlinked `config.json` (a dotfile manager) is sealed by name only: the other name stays writable. The Linux spawn path treats it as it does every pre-created leaf: a RESOLVING link warns and continues, because refusing would block all agent work on a host whose dotfiles legitimately carry a second name; a DANGLING link (target absent) refuses the spawn with `SandboxCeilingUnsealable` via `_refuse_if_dangling_symlink`, since a mount on a dangling name has nothing to seal.

- **Decision-seam consent (keystone leaf `decisions_consent.json`)** — the switch that lets the decision seam send message text and skill descriptions to the external Jev provider (see [decisions.md](decisions.md)) is `~/.kiro/crew/decisions_consent.json`, on `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` (agent file tools refuse read and write), `sandbox._CREW_READONLY_LEAVES` (mounted read-only in every mode) and the absent-ceiling pre-create list. Same class and same reasoning as `aws_service_consent.json`: consent to send the operator's data to a paid external service is an authorization, and `config.json` is a hot-applied SETTINGS file: the sandbox seals it read-only (`sandbox._CREW_READONLY_LEAVES`), so an in-sandbox agent shell can no longer write it, but every ordinary settings writer (the config PATCH, `kirocrew config set`) still reaches it without the owner-only handler a consent needs, so a `decisions.enabled` there would be one settings edit away from taking effect on the next message. `DecisionsConfig` therefore carries no `enabled` field and the config PATCH refuses the path. Consent is bound to a destination: the keystone records the `provider.endpoint` the config named when the owner consented, and `consent.permits()` sends only while the configured endpoint still equals it — `provider.endpoint` lives in that same settings file, so a bare yes/no would let an endpoint edit the owner never reviewed redirect consented messages to another server. Reads fail soft to `{}` → not consented, with a strict `is True` identity test; the only writer is the owner-only, browser-called `PUT /api/decisions/consent` handler, which refuses app tokens and allow-listed non-owner users on the read as well as the write, audits every grant/revocation to SEL, and leaves a corrupt file byte-identical rather than resetting it.
- **Browsing has no keystone capability toggle, deliberately (see [browser.md](browser.md)); its executable is a READONLY keystone leaf.** `<data-home>/playwright-cli` holds the product-managed entrypoint and npm package tree. It is on `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` for agent file tools and `_CREW_READONLY_LEAVES` for every OS sandbox: in-sandbox browser commands can read and execute it, while a write that would choose the binary the unsandboxed gateway executes fails at the kernel boundary. The empty directory is absent-equivalent and belongs to `_CREW_PRECREATE_READONLY_DIR_LEAVES`, so the first sandbox cannot win an absent-target race before the first install. It is also the sole `_CREW_NOFOLLOW_READONLY_DIR_LEAVES` member: a resolving symlink, or one that wins the `mkdir` race, refuses the spawn because the bind mount would seal its target while leaving the executable name replaceable. Gateway resolution checks this absolute leaf first, then fixed system directories whose resolved launcher hierarchy the gateway user cannot write. The in-product installer also creates and no-follow pins the real directory before passing it to npm; links, Windows reparse points and create/open identity races abort before any package write, and the Windows pin blocks rename for the duration of npm. It never resolves from `PATH`, `~/.local/bin`, an active project or the workspace; legacy user-local launchers remain on disk and are ignored. The launcher is identity only for gateway-owned calls on every OS: the managed installer atomically stages the native Node executable as `gateway-node` on POSIX or `node.exe` on Windows, and the gateway runs it with the attributed package's contained `playwright-cli.js`. A fixed-system copy is usable only with a Node and package entry whose complete hierarchies also pass the non-writable-system check. Thus a POSIX `env node` shebang cannot select an agent-writable version-manager binary, and owner URL bytes never cross a Windows command-processor boundary. Binary presence is still NOT an approval signal. Every agent invocation follows the ordinary shell approval ladder, and only an explicit trusted pattern, session trust or auto-approve grant may skip the prompt. Because browsing is a shell command, it is governed on the `commands` plane and an `mcp`-scope deny does not reach it.

- **Operator OAuth consent-endpoint extension (keystone leaf `oauth_endpoints.json`)** — the security module's OAuth banner-safety contract (`security.oauth_url_contains_credential`, and `_exfil_url_warning` under `allow_oauth_entropy=True`) exempts standard front-channel params (`state`, PKCE, …) from the base64-blob/query-length heuristics only at an exact-match `(host, path)` in the code-owned `_OAUTH_AUTHORIZATION_ENDPOINTS`. `~/.kiro/crew/oauth_endpoints.json` (`{"additional_authorization_endpoints": [{"host", "path"}]}`) is the operator's escape hatch for identity providers outside that launch set (Okta orgs, Auth0, self-hosted OIDC, tenant-scoped Entra paths): `security._load_operator_oauth_endpoints()` unions strictly validated entries with the builtin set at check time (`_approved_oauth_authorization_endpoint`, memoized on the file's stat so a hand-edit takes effect on the next check without a restart). **Enforcement point:** the dashboard's live MCP OAuth banner validates URLs with this same gate — `_emit_mcp_oauth_request` in `chat_runner.py` calls `security.oauth_url_contains_credential` directly — so an operator endpoint entry governs the banner path as well as every other consumer wired to the contract gate. Each entry widens a trust boundary, so the file is on `_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` (full read+write keystone block on both the tool path and every shell form) — an agent must not be able to author its own exemption — and there is deliberately no dashboard writer; the operator hand-edits it out-of-band. Every read fails soft to the EMPTY set (missing/unreadable/corrupt/non-object file, mirroring `computer_use.enable_state.load_state`), invalid entries are skipped individually with a warning (no wildcards, schemes, ports, userinfo, percent-escapes, IP literals, `..`, whitespace, or backslashes; hosts are lowercase-normalized DNS names with a letter TLD, paths exact and case-sensitive), and the entry list is truncated at 50 before validation so a mangled file cannot amplify. HTTPS-only / no-explicit-port / exact-match stay enforced by the gate logic and are NOT relaxable via the file, and the exemption grants exactly what the builtin set grants — fixed-credential patterns, heavy percent-encoding, userinfo, fragments, backslashes, and unknown-param heuristics remain unconditional. The markerless bare-secret entropy heuristic follows the same exact endpoint/parameter scope instead of scanning entropy-bearing recognized parameter values first; parameter names, unknown parameters, and non-query components remain in its scan target. That exemption is additionally bounded to the shapes the protocol itself can emit (`_oauth_entropy_value_is_protocol_shaped`, judged on EVERY decoded form: it percent-decodes until the text stops changing, bounded by `_MAX_URL_DECODE_PASSES`, and refuses a value still decodable at the bound, so `%252F` cannot launder the standard alphabet past a single decode): base64url emits `-`/`_` and never `+`/`/`, and an S256 `code_challenge` is base64url of a 32-byte digest, so it is exactly 43 characters. A base64-standard-alphabet run — the shape of an AWS secret key — therefore cannot ride `state`, `nonce`, or `code_challenge` into the blanked set. The residual is narrower but real: a markerless 40-character credential that happens to be alphanumeric is indistinguishable from ordinary base64url state entropy and is accepted only at this boundary; general output redactors retain the heuristic. An approval that came from an operator entry (not the builtin set) emits a best-effort `oauth_endpoint_extension_used` SEL event, deduped per process per endpoint. **Rejections name the endpoint, never the values:** `security.sanitized_oauth_endpoint(url)` returns the lowercase host + path of a rejected authorization URL (query/fragment/port/userinfo are never included; both components are scanned at every percent-decode layer up to the gate's own `_MAX_URL_DECODE_PASSES` budget — a credential-bearing or budget-exhausting path self-redacts to the shared tag, a credential-bearing host makes the helper return `None`, a non-ASCII host is surfaced in IDNA A-label form; both components are length-capped and a capped component ends in `…`; unparseable URLs return `None`). The banner path (`_emit_mcp_oauth_request`) surfaces that pair in the rejection text — which also spells the `{"additional_authorization_endpoints": [{"host", "path"}]}` entry shape — and inside the `error` meta field the dashboard's failed banner actually renders; no additional meta keys are emitted because no shipped surface reads any. So the user can tell WHICH endpoint tripped the scanner and what to write into `oauth_endpoints.json`, without the rejection ever echoing state/PKCE material (#7578). **Connections mint/warm rejection surfaces name the endpoint on the card, never in a log.** The cold mint (`connections/mint.py`, terminal `mint_url_rejected`) calls `security.sanitized_oauth_endpoint_display(url)` — the copy-ready contract layered on the diagnostic pair: it returns one `host/path` string only when writing the entry would WORK: the host matches `_OAUTH_EXTENSION_HOST_RE` (so `localhost`, IP literals and a `…`-capped host are refused), the path passes `_valid_oauth_extension_path` and is neither the redaction tag nor `…`-capped, and the rejection is one the allowlist can clear — `security.oauth_rejection_is_endpoint_exemptible(url)` re-runs the gate via `diagnose_oauth_url_credential(url, assume_approved_endpoint=True)`, which treats the endpoint as approved WITHOUT consulting the builtin set or the operator file (no lookup, no `oauth_endpoint_extension_used` audit) and relaxes nothing else, so a URL refused for a fixed credential, userinfo, a fragment, path parameters, heavy percent-encoding, `http` or an explicit port stays unnamed rather than advertise a remedy that leaves it rejected; `None` otherwise — and stores the result as `MintState["rejected_endpoint"]`, which rides `pending_mint_for` and the `GET /api/connections/mint` payload to the Connections card (`mint_failure_url_rejected_endpoint`; the unnamed `mint_failure_url_rejected` copy stays the fallback on `None`). The warning log and the `_log_mint_outcome` audit line stay slug-only by decision: routing URL-derived text through the logger is what the credential-disclosure scanners (Semgrep `python-logger-credential-disclosure`, CodeQL `py/clear-text-logging-sensitive-data`) flag, and a card field is not a logger sink, so no inline suppression or barrier model is needed. The warm premint gate (`warm._credential_bearing_slugs`) does not name the endpoint itself: a refused slug's claim is RELEASED (never a failed row — `test_a_url_carrying_a_credential_is_refused_rather_than_stored`), the card then asks for a cold mint, and that mint re-hits the same URL and names the endpoint through the surface above, so the warm refusal is actionable without a second channel (#7765).

**Privacy-safe OAuth rejection diagnostics.** `security.diagnose_oauth_url_credential()` returns `None` for an accepted URL or an `OAuthUrlCredentialDiagnostic` for the first rejecting sub-check. The record carries only a stable `rule`, a URL-component category, an optional code-owned standard query-parameter name, and a shape profile: total length plus counts of ASCII uppercase, ASCII lowercase, digits, percent signs, URL punctuation, and all other characters. `oauth_url_contains_credential()` retains its boolean caller contract and logs that same bounded signature when it rejects. The diagnostic path does not change a rule, add a bypass, retry, or retain a URL. The URL and parameter value are never returned, logged, persisted, hashed, sampled, or represented by a prefix/suffix; malformed, credential-shaped, and unrecognized parameter names are omitted rather than echoed. This is sufficient for a controlled mint loop to distinguish standard OAuth entropy false positives (for example, `credential_scan_bare_secret_raw` on `state` versus `exfil_query_length`) without creating a second credential-bearing sink. An entropy-bearing recognized parameter value at an approved endpoint produces no diagnostic on entropy alone, while the same shape in an unknown parameter retains the stable `credential_scan_bare_secret_raw` rejection signature.

**Pod-scoped MCP OAuth grant isolation** (`mcp_grant.py`, `config.paths.kiro_oauth_cache_home`, `pod/runtime.py`, `acp/client.py` + `acp/runtime.py`) — kiro-cli writes each MCP server's OAuth grant as a paired `<sha256(mcp_url)>.token.json` / `.registration.json` artifact under `$HOME/.aws/sso/cache`, derived from the spawned process's real `$HOME` with no env var to relocate just that subtree. A Dev Fleet pod deliberately keeps its GATEWAY process's real `$HOME` unchanged (isolating only `KIROCREW_HOME`/`KIRO_HOME`, see [pod isolation](#os-level-sandbox-sandboxpy) above), so absent this mechanism a pod's own `mcp_grant` reads (mint, status, disconnect, mcp_discovery's remote probe) stated grants under the REAL host's cache — a Connections card inside a pod read "Connected" from a grant the operator minted on the real machine — while a pod-spawned kiro-cli child's OWN writes landed there too, leaving a real, durable, machine-level credential that OUTLIVED `pod down`.

- **One resolver, both sides read it.** `mcp_grant.kiro_oauth_cache_dir()` — the single default every caller reaches with no explicit `cache_dir`/`home` — now resolves through `config.paths.kiro_oauth_cache_home()` instead of a bare `Path.home()` call. That resolver honours `KIROCREW_OS_HOME` **only when `KIROCREW_POD` is exactly `"1"`**, the same gate the write side applies: reads and writes must turn on together, because an override honoured on the read side alone would repoint grant reads while kiro-cli kept writing under the real home — recreating the exact split this resolver exists to close. It rejects the same unsafe targets as `kiro_home()`'s `KIRO_HOME` (filesystem/drive root, POSIX system dirs), degrading to `Path.home()`.
- **The relocated tree is FENCED, not merely moved.** Relocating a credential store would otherwise move it out from under the `kiro_crew.security` sensitive-path gate: `_seed_pod_os_home` stages the agent runtime's own identity store into `<pod home>/os-home`, the pod's kiro-cli child MINTS its MCP OAuth grant pairs under `<pod home>/os-home/.aws/sso/cache`, and `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` entries are anchored under the real `$HOME` (plus `KIROCREW_HOME` / `KIRO_HOME`) — so an agent inside a pod could `fs_read` a pod-minted grant, or the staged identity store, at the pod-path spelling while the identical shapes under `~` are refused. `KIROCREW_OS_HOME` is therefore anchored as an **alternate home root** in `_resolved_root_key` / `_home_dir_targets_uncached` (and folded into the cache key, so changing it invalidates the memo), exactly as `KIROCREW_HOME` already re-anchors the crew-home leaves. **Every** `home_dirs` entry re-anchors under it, not just `.aws`: the variable relocates the whole home, so `.ssh` and every other fenced leaf move with it. Each entry is emitted with BOTH separator joins (`<root>/.aws` and `<root>\.aws`), because `_shape_path_token` normalises a token's backslashes to forward slashes before comparing — with the running OS's join alone, the Windows target and every Windows candidate form never compared equal and the gate silently stopped covering its own targets there. The real home's anchors are unaffected — the pod root is added, never substituted. **Which layer holds this, after #9089 and #9183**: `is_sensitive_path()`, which resolves every path a caller opens, plus the OS mask below. The earlier revision of this passage described the command matcher as covering the real `$HOME` while missing relocated ones, and that parity framing is now obsolete: #9183 ("split security.py into a package and drop path regex") deleted the fence-literal and relative-traversal matchers outright, so `is_sensitive_bash_command` retains only a size ceiling, an IMDS check and an environment-credential exfiltration check. Measured on the rebased head, it answers `allow` for EVERY path spelling — `~/.aws/credentials` and `~/.ssh/id_rsa` included, not merely the override-rooted ones — so the text layer is out of the path business universally rather than blind to one root. Nothing about the pod tree is special there. That is main's stated posture, not a gap this mechanism opens: a path fenced only in command TEXT is still reachable through an `open()` that never routes through the tool gate, so the fence has to live where the path is resolved and the OS sandbox has to bound the subprocess. Pinned by `test_pod_runtime_auth_store.py::TestTheStagedStoresResidualIsPinned` and `test_pod_home_remap_security_floor.py::TestPodMintedGrantsAreFencedFromToolCalls`.
- **The spawned CHILD's writes are moved separately, at the ACP spawn chokepoint.** `acp.client._apply_pod_home_remap` — applied identically at both spawn transports (`AcpClient._spawn`, `AcpRuntime._spawn_admitted`), never a hand-rolled copy — remaps a pod-spawned kiro-cli child's `HOME`/`USERPROFILE` to the SAME `KIROCREW_OS_HOME` directory, gated on both the pod marker (`KIROCREW_POD`, compared **exactly** to `"1"` — every non-empty string is truthy, so a truthiness test would remap `HOME` for a child whose `KIROCREW_POD=false` says it is not in a pod) and positive membership in `ACP_BACKENDS_POD_HOME_REMAP`. That set is deliberately **its own**, not a reuse of `ACP_BACKENDS_INTERNAL_SANDBOX`: the two answer different questions — "does this harness carry its own OS sandbox?" versus "does relocating this harness's `HOME` move its credential store?" — and conflating them would hand a harness added to the sandbox set for sandbox reasons credential-relocation semantics it never opted into, the capability conflation harness-parity H6 exists to prevent. Without this half, kiro-cli's own writes would still land under the real host's `$HOME` even though every `mcp_grant` READ now resolves the pod's tree — two independent derivations of "where do grants live" disagreeing with each other.
- **kiro-cli's own sign-in keeps working, and the seeding cannot be redirected.** `pod.runtime_home._seed_pod_os_home`, run once at pod boot alongside `write_pod_config`, create-only stages the AGENT RUNTIME's own identity store — the per-platform paths derived from `identity_stores.store_mappings()` (`~/.local/share/{kiro-cli,amazon-q}` and their macOS/Windows siblings), which is where the harness actually resolves its access token — into the pod's `KIROCREW_OS_HOME` tree, so a sign-in performed once on the operator's real machine authenticates every pod. Capped at 512 files per store as a runaway guard, and derived from the store table rather than restated so a platform or product added there is staged without a second edit. The host's `.aws/sso/cache` is **NOT** copied: an earlier revision staged the operator's single-file SSO tokens there behind a `kiro-auth-token*.json` glob, a review round showed the copied bearer tokens were readable to pod agent tools, and the staging was **deleted** rather than masked around — so a pod's `.aws/sso/cache` is created EMPTY and holds only grants that pod itself mints. A pod therefore cannot be pre-authorized to a provider nobody consented to from inside it, by construction rather than by a filename glob. Because this copies HOST sign-in state into a tree under the pod root and re-runs on every boot, **every component is created and opened through a pinned no-follow descriptor** (`pinned_fs.create_and_open_dir_pinned` + `copy_file_pinned`, the same discipline `seed_home_from_scenario` applies on any host with a pinned tree walk). SCOPE: Windows has no `dir_fd`, so neither this staging nor the fixture seed can hold a destination descriptor there. `pod.runtime_home._seed_home_windows` states the narrower win32 guarantee it substitutes -- reparse-point screening of every component, a self-created home, a `fd_real_path` witness on its handle, `copy_file_pinned`'s `src_fd` source form, `O_EXCL` destinations, and a re-witness before the completion marker -- together with its residual: the pin refuses a reparse point and, from the moment it is taken, freezes the pinned directory and every directory above it against rename and delete -- so what remains is a same-UID rename-swap landing in the instant BEFORE the first pin, which the re-witness does NOT detect, because a witness taken before the pin can only be compared against itself. `pod.runtime_home._seed_pod_os_home_windows`, the branch that builds the machine-level grant corridor, narrows that window as far as this platform allows: it pins the deepest ancestor that already exists BEFORE creating anything, so every level below is created under a parent something is holding. Both branches leave the same irreducible residual -- the anchor is located by name -- which is the operational-isolation boundary the pod threat model already records (a pod is not protection from arbitrary same-UID processes), not a new one. That is the operational-isolation boundary already recorded for pods, not a new one. Every other host lacking the pinned walk keeps the outright refusal: a name-based `mkdir(parents=True)` plus a by-name write would follow a link planted at `os-home` or at any component beneath it and deposit the operator's SSO token wherever it pointed, including an agent-readable workspace. A refused component leaves the pod booting signed-out, which is the safe outcome.
- **AWS file credentials deliberately do NOT follow a pod child, and the pointer variables are no longer exported.** `AWS_CONFIG_FILE` / `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` default to `$HOME/.aws/{config,credentials}`, so a bare `HOME` remap points the credential chain at the pod's (otherwise empty) `os-home` tree. An earlier revision therefore had `_apply_pod_home_remap` pin both variables back to the REAL home's files, so a pod agent turn could still reach the operator's profiles. **That pin is removed.** Naming those files in the child environment is itself the leak: it bypasses the `HOME` remap and gives the subprocess a direct pointer to the real host's credential files. The shell-command gate deliberately does not resolve path variables or match path text, so no finite set of command spellings can make that export safe. The alias is deleted at its source instead, and the two rules that existed only to defend it (`credential-exfil-aws-credential-path-var`, `credential-exfil-aws-credential-path-var-interpreter`) are **removed with it** — partial coverage of an unbounded bypass space is worse than none, because it reads as a fence. The catalog is back to its pre-change count, and this PR now touches neither the deny catalog nor its golden manifest. Corroborating precedent already in the tree: `credential-exfil-env-grep-aws` deliberately ALLOWS `env | grep AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`, on the stated grounds that the variable holds a path rather than a secret — so denying retrieval of the same name elsewhere was never a coherent posture. **Acceptance criterion, corrected:** inside a pod, an **ACP agent turn has no inherited AWS credentials on any path**. File credentials do not resolve (the pointer exports are gone, so `~/.aws/{config,credentials}` lands under the remapped empty pod home, including for a `credential_process` profile). Environment credentials do not reach the turn either: `sandbox.scrub_agent_subprocess_env` scrubs `_SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES`, which includes `AWS_SECRET` and `AWS_SESSION`, from every Kiro/ACP child, so `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` are removed even when the operator has them (`AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` survives, but a key id without its secret is not a credential). An earlier revision of this section claimed "AWS credentials resolve from the ENVIRONMENT only" and that "env-credentialed agent turns are unaffected", citing `build_pod_env` keeping `AWS_*`. That keep is real but it is not the last word: `build_pod_env` shapes the pod GATEWAY's environment, while the ACP child is scrubbed after it — the two statements are about different processes, and only the gateway keeps the variables. The corrected posture is strictly stronger than the one previously claimed and is the intended one for a throwaway instance whose purpose is to not hold machine-level credentials; an operator cannot obtain AWS inside a pod agent turn by exporting credentials into their shell, which is a deliberate property of the agent-subprocess scrub rather than something the pod-home remap can undo. An operator-set pointer is **removed too**, which is the half a later round corrected: whose file it names does not change what the pod's agent obtains by dereferencing it, and an absolute host pointer walks around the `HOME` relocation entirely. `acp.client.CREDENTIAL_POINTER_ENV_VARS` carries the family — `AWS_CONFIG_FILE`, `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`, `AWS_WEB_IDENTITY_TOKEN_FILE`, and the container-provider trio (`AWS_CONTAINER_CREDENTIALS_RELATIVE_URI` / `_FULL_URI` / `AWS_CONTAINER_AUTHORIZATION_TOKEN_FILE`, which are URLs no filesystem mask can reach at all). It is an explicit list because no table enumerates these (a store ROOT is a directory the product's layout hangs off; these name a credential file or endpoint directly), and it is deliberately not folded into `_SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES`: that global scrub covers variables that CARRY a secret and must keep the non-pod `credential_process` path working against the real `~/.aws`. One philosophy, two scopes — secrets scrubbed globally, pointers scrubbed where the thing they point at has been relocated. The floor for a path named through a variable remains `redact_credentials` on the output plus the sensitive-path fence on every LITERAL spelling (which now includes `KIROCREW_OS_HOME` as an alternate home root).

- **A pod OS home that cannot be verified aborts the boot.** `os-home` becomes the kiro-cli child's `HOME`, so it is the one directory whose integrity decides whether pod grants stay in the pod. `_seed_pod_os_home` builds every component through pinned no-follow descriptors and refuses a planted link — but an earlier revision then *booted anyway* with the refused path, so the child received the link's target as its `HOME` and wrote its own MCP OAuth grants into the real host tree: exactly the machine-level grant writer this mechanism exists to prevent. The refusal is now fatal. The two outcomes are on deliberately separate branches: **building the tree is mandatory** (a refused or unbuildable component raises `PodError`, `boot` prints `FATAL` and returns `EXIT_REFUSED_UNRECOVERABLE`, and no gateway is exec'd), while **copying the tokens stays best-effort** (an unreadable host cache or an uncopyable individual token still boots the pod signed-out). Every component is chmodded to `0o700`, not just the leaf, so no level of the path the credential lands under is group- or world-writable. On win32, where no `O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW` descriptor exists, `_seed_pod_os_home_windows` builds the same four levels one at a time under a parent already held through `platform_compat.pin_directory` (a `CreateFileW` handle without `FILE_SHARE_DELETE`, which refuses a reparse point at the name and blocks a rename or delete of the directory and everything above it while held); the mode tightening is a no-op there and says so, and the token copy stays create-only (`O_EXCL`) with a SQLite store skipped because a per-file copy of a live database cannot be consistent. The pins stop a rename or a delete, not a same-UID write into the tree, which is the same residual the POSIX branch records below. Because the unit is `Restart=on-failure` + `RestartSec=5`, a refusal would otherwise become a 5-second loop re-running the same refusal forever and burying the `FATAL` line — the cost that previously made refusing look unavailable (see the tunnel-flag comment in `pod/runtime_boot.py`). `pod/unit.py` now emits `RestartPreventExitStatus` from `pod/config.TERMINAL_BOOT_EXIT_CODES`, covering this refusal (78) alongside the pre-existing standing refusals (provisioning 3, live-port collision 70) — none of which a retry heals — so the unit goes `failed` and stays there with the reason visible. **Residual, stated rather than claimed closed:** a same-UID process can still swap a component between the check and the child's `exec`. Per the recorded pod threat model a pod is operational isolation, not protection from arbitrary same-UID processes; closing that window would require handing the child a descriptor instead of a path, which the kiro-cli interface does not accept.
- **The real passwd home stays fenced on the file-tool path regardless.** `is_sensitive_path()` runs inside the gateway process against the gateway's own `Path.home()`. The spawned child's remapped `HOME` exists only in the environment passed to `create_subprocess_exec` / `create_subprocess_limited` and never replaces the gateway's `os.environ`, so file-tool requests for the real host's `~/.aws`, `~/.ssh`, and `~/.kirocrew*` remain denied. Shell behavior continues to depend on the sandbox tier, not on command-text path matching.
- **Reclaimed on teardown.** Both `KIROCREW_OS_HOME`'s directory (`<pod home>/os-home`) and the pod's `KIROCREW_HOME` proper nest under one `home_dir`, so `cleanup_home`'s existing `pod down` sweep reclaims the whole OAuth-grant tree with everything else — a pod's grants are exactly as ephemeral as the pod.

**Windows UNC trusted-root gate** (`unc_probe_allowed` in `hook_runtime/windows_paths.py` + `validate_file_path` in `hook_runtime/safe_reads.py`, reached through `hooks.py`) — a UNC path names a HOST, so resolving or stat-ing untrusted UNC-shaped text (`\\evil\share\x.png` or `//evil/share/x.png` echoed in any message or query) makes Windows open an outbound SMB connection to an attacker-named host. `validate_file_path` therefore consults `unc_probe_allowed` **before any resolution** on Windows — the ordering is the control, since `realpath` on UNC text is itself the probe — and the gate's comparison is purely lexical (`normcase`/`normpath`), never touching the network. Filesystem access is restricted to UNC paths under three trusted roots, all admitted on the same basis (directories this gateway itself writes to): (1) the crew **data home** — on a roaming profile the home directory is itself a UNC share, the one legitimate source of UNC attachment paths; (2) the **temp directory** — channel-side image staging; (3) the **kiro agents directory** (`<kiro home>/agents`) — `apps.bridges._register_agents` and `agent.rebuild_agent_config` write the managed specs there, and it is a *sibling* of the data home on the same share, so before #6721 its absence made `_read_agent_spec` silently read every user-level agent spec as absent on a UNC home. The prefix comparison is separator-boundary-anchored (a sibling share on the same host, or an `agents-evil` neighbour directory, is refused), a root that is not itself UNC-shaped admits nothing (the roots cannot become a bypass on an ordinary local home), and **both resolving roots are memoized per configuration** (each keyed on the raw home env value and the accessor identity): `kiro_agents_dir()` resolves `KIRO_HOME` with filesystem I/O — on a UNC-shaped override, an SMB touch — and `data_home()` does the same with `KIROCREW_HOME`, because its override branch runs `_valid_override_home()` (a `Path.resolve`) on **every** call and `config_dir()`'s memo sits behind that predicate rather than in front of it. Neither may run per gate check on hot/async validation paths — `unc_probe_allowed` is reached from `iter_local_refs`, which `telegram.renderer._rotate_on_length` runs inline on the event loop against a documented microsecond budget — and a computation failure memoizes the root as absent fail-safe (the gate stays total; recovery is an env change or restart, and the degraded state is the pre-#6721 status quo). The **project-level** agents dir (`project_agents_dir`) is deliberately NOT admitted: an arbitrary project directory is not gateway-written, so admitting it would be a genuine trust-boundary widening rather than a repair.

**Write-only config protection** (`is_sensitive_write_path` in `security/` + `hooks.py`) — runtime config files are protected against *modification* by agent tools while staying *readable*:
- `~/.kiro/crew/config.json` and `~/.kiro/crew/config.local.json` are in a write-only tier (`_WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS`, expanded under every `_CREW_HOME_PREFIXES` entry so the pre-move legacy copy is covered too), deliberately NOT in the read+write `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` list above — the dashboard file viewer, `cat`, and knowledge indexing legitimately read config.
- `is_sensitive_write_path(path)` is a superset of `is_sensitive_path(path)`, sharing the same `_path_in_home_dirs` resolve/casefold core so the two gates can't drift. `hooks.on_tool_call` denies a file-EDIT tool call whose target resolves to a config file — a call is on the write plane when it declares the ACP `edit` kind OR its tool_call frame carried a `{"type": "diff"}` content block naming a path (`platform.tool_paths.is_edit_call`: the diff block is the edit's target of record, and only a call declaring a file change carries one, so the spec-optional `kind` field is never the gate). The judged target set is the same union the always-enforced tier judges (`platform.tool_paths.edit_target_candidates`: every accepted path spelling in the params plus the diff block's `event.diff_path`), a write-plane call that carries params (any dict, `{}` included) or a diff block but whose union is empty is denied rather than passed unjudged, and a diff-block path still relative after `~`/env expansion is denied as unverifiable (it would resolve against the gateway CWD, not the agent workspace) (#9297); a call carrying neither params nor a diff block falls through, matching the always-enforced tier, which such a call never reaches. The read allowance is keyed on the ABSENCE of a diff block: a kindless call without one stays a read. Pinned by `test_hooks_edit_gate_diff_path.py`.
- Empty/unknown ACP tool kinds without a diff content block are intentionally left to the load-time clamp backstop rather than hard-denied, to avoid over-blocking config reads that arrive without a kind (governance's shape inference can apply both read+write scopes because it is a permissive policy intersection; this gate is a hard deny). Bash writes (`tee`, `>`, `sed -i`) likewise fall to the clamp.
- The operator edits config out-of-band via the dashboard config API / CLI, which do not route through this gate.
- **Authorization-carrying leaves in `config.json` take effect without a restart.** The process config watcher (`config/live.py`, `DEFAULT_POLL_INTERVAL_SECS` = 2s) hands a changed channel section to that transport's `reconfigure(section)`, so an edit to an admission roster (`slack.allowed_users`, `telegram.allowed_user_ids`, `weixin.allowed_user_ids`, …), a DM policy, or `hooks.auto_approve_*` is live within one poll instead of at the next operator restart. This changes the *latency* of a forged write, not its reachability: `config.json` is sealed read-only in every sandbox mode (`sandbox._CREW_READONLY_LEAVES`), so the controls on a write are unchanged — the OS seal, which refuses an in-sandbox shell's `open()` however the write is spelled; the file-tool write fence above (`is_sensitive_write_path` + the `hooks.on_tool_call` edit-plane deny); the load-time clamp; and the SEL record every transport emits when an applied section actually changes an authorization field (`log_api_access(caller="config", operation="<channel>_transport.reconfigure", outcome="allow_list_changed" | "dm_policy_changed", resources=<delta>)`, and `operation="hook_manager.reconfigure", outcome="auto_approve_changed"` for the `hooks.auto_approve_*` set). The residuals are a write from OUTSIDE the sandbox — an unsandboxed spawn (`agent.sandbox: "off"`, `sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec`) or a compromised process on the host — and, on Linux only, an in-sandbox write landing in the rename-detach window recorded under the sealed-config entry above (the per-file bind detaches at the next gateway save of `config.json`, and a `hooks.auto_approve_*` or roster edit written then is adopted within one poll); both SEL detects after the fact rather than prevents; before hot reload such a write lay inert until a restart, now it is admitted within ~2s. A leaf whose live adoption would be unsafe rather than merely fast is marked `restart=True` in the schema (`messaging.dm_scope` is the messaging example: its session-key namespace seeds per-conversation counters at boot), and `ConfigWatch` refuses any live registration under a marked path.

**Array-nested target paths bind on both planes (issue #6558).** A batch-shaped tool carries its real targets inside an array argument (`{"operations": [{"mode": "Line", "path": …}]}`). The sensitive-path keystone in `hooks.py` (`target_paths` / `TargetPaths`) was made nesting-aware first; the governance INTERSECTION plane (`platform/governance.py` `_tool_arg_paths` / `classify_tool_args`) previously read only the TOP level, so a nested path produced no `(scope, item)` pair, `gate_decision` hit its permit-by-default `if not pairs` branch, and an operator ceiling denying `filesystem.read`/`filesystem.write` outside the workspace never bound on the nested spelling. The bounded, depth-aware, iterative walk now lives in ONE shared lower-level module, `kiro_crew.platform.tool_paths` (stdlib-only, imports neither `hooks` nor `governance`, so there is no cycle — `hooks` imports `governance`), and BOTH planes delegate to it. The third extractor, `hooks._SEARCH_DENY_ARG_KEYS`, stays flat by design (documented residual below) and is out of scope.
- **Truncated-scan policy on the permit-by-default plane.** The shared walk is bounded (`_TARGET_PATH_MAX_PATHS`=256, `_TARGET_PATH_MAX_NODES`=10_000) and reports a `truncated` flag. The `hooks` keystone fails SAFE by hard-denying any truncated scan. The governance plane is permit-by-default and must NOT blanket-deny an ungoverned standalone host, so on truncation it emits the filesystem scope(s) the tool kind implies (`edit`→`filesystem.write`; `read`→`filesystem.read`; unknown-kind-without-command→both) against a synthetic, never-permittable item (`_TRUNCATED_SCAN_ITEM`, containing a NUL byte so no allow-list pattern can match it). Effect: a prefix-bounded ALLOW-mode ceiling that confines the scope to a workspace DENIES the unverifiable call (closing the "bury the path past 10_000 nodes to escape the ceiling" fail-open), while an ungoverned scope still permits it (permit-by-default preserved). (A catch-all ALLOW pattern — `**`/`/**`/`*` — does match the marker via fnmatch and permits, but such a ceiling confines nothing and is unconstrained anyway, so this is consistent with its own posture rather than a bypass.) A DENY-mode ceiling that blocks only specific paths permits the marker — a targeted deny is not a general confinement and a partial scan cannot prove the buried path hit that one pattern; the always-on resolved keystone remains the authoritative guard for the sensitive tiers there. This resolves issue #6558 open-question-2 (option (c)); rejected: (a) permit-as-before keeps the fail-open, (b) unconditional deny over-blocks ungoverned hosts and every unrelated scope.

**Spec Builder's decision record** (`trust/spec-builder-decisions.json`) — the app
refuses a second answer for the same normalized question. Each record is bound to a
fingerprint of the rendered id, title, and order-independent option set, so reordering the
same choices cannot reopen a settled question while an agent reusing an id for a new question
does not inherit the old answer. A claim is first persisted as a pending outbox
entry and is marked final only when the chat runner reports that the model consumed the
prompt. Immediately before model dispatch, the row moves durably from `pending` to
`relayed`; a failure to persist that boundary refuses dispatch. A crash before consumption
leaves either state for the recovery flow; an already-persisted chat row is
reused rather than appended twice, but is not itself mistaken for proof of model
consumption. The detail GET reports `decision_recovery_pending` for either durable
outbox state; it never dispatches an agent turn. The SPA follows that signal with the CSRF-protected
`POST /api/apps/spec-builder/specs/{name}/recover-decision`, which performs the
replay and lets the next detail poll observe the running turn. Immediately before
any replay, the backend revalidates the question fingerprint and offered option
against the normalized current state. A mismatched
`pending` row with no chat marker is removed rather than relayed or finalized. A
`relayed` or chat-marked row is retained fail-closed because a crash after model
consumption but before ledger finalization is indistinguishable from a pre-model crash.
Recovery skips a retained `relayed` row once its question is provably stale so that the
ambiguity marker cannot permanently starve a newer current answer behind it.
If a failed turn requeues the delivery with consumption callbacks, the generic queue
editor refuses to replace that entry: those callbacks can settle only their original text.
App tokens cannot send or recover these human-authored turns; each denial is recorded in SEL.
Execute, its `handoff` alias and Stop arm or remove the owner session's nudge loop, so they take
the owner predicate `POST /api/autonudge` uses (`is_owner_dashboard_request`): a non-owner
subject or app token gets 403 `owner_only`, a signed pre-owner bootstrap subject 401
`stale_session_reauth`, and each denial is audited in SEL as `spec_builder_execute` /
`spec_builder_stop`.
The durable prompt is rebuilt from the backend-validated title and selected option; its
bound includes both normalized fields so replay cannot truncate the immutable answer.
Every Spec Builder dispatch boundary (decision answer, ordinary message, and execution
handoff) also re-reads each indexed name for the spec directory after its last await and
compares every live slot's task identity and monotonic turn generation with the initial
busy scan. The generation survives normal teardown clearing `slot.task` back to idle, so
this catches an alias turn that starts and finishes during validation as well as an alias
the agent adds mid-turn; the synchronous final check and task publication are one
event-loop step. Create registration uses the same normalized directory identity while
holding that directory's turn lock and refuses an index entry for any second name that
already points at it. Filesystem equivalence is checked by directory identity, so Windows
and case-insensitive macOS variants must not mint two slots that dispatch agents into the
same files; macOS arbitration folds case conservatively before the index transaction so a
create cannot race delete cleanup. An upgrade-state alias, agent-written alias, or sole
index path rewritten to a filesystem-equivalent spelling fails closed when it differs
from an immutable lexical key already present in the protected ledger. Detail reads,
new-spec registration, decision claims, and deletion can therefore neither mint a second
answer record nor strand the first one under an unreadable spelling. Decision claims
validate aliases and persist the answer from one protected-ledger snapshot, and refuse an
unreadable snapshot rather than retrying the write from different state. A handoff that
already armed its bounded nudge loop unwinds that loop and its execution claim when the
final alias check refuses dispatch. A process-owned generation, rather than agent-writable
index status or timestamps, authenticates the handoff's pre-dispatch claim. Handoff checks
that generation inside the directory turn lock before making the durable `executing` claim,
after authorization, and again after its final alias scan. Stop revokes the generation before
waiting for the lock and refuses new handoffs for that creation until it commits, so a Stop
that overlaps startup prevents the older request from dispatching or a newer request from
restarting behind it. Revocation remains provisional while Stop or Delete validates and
tears down the captured creation: both execution and ordinary-turn tokens are removed only
by a successful authoritative commit. A stale or failed control restores them; if a handoff
already observed the provisional revocation and unwound, a supervised settlement restores
its durable status to planning rather than leaving a dead `executing` claim. Rollback also
reconciles ordinary published turns whose completion callback fired while their token was
provisionally revoked, so an already-idle slot cannot retain an exclusive claim indefinitely.
The client creation claim is validated before that barrier is published, and the barrier
only revokes the matching verified name/slot creation, independent of its mutable directory
spelling, so a stale control cannot cancel replacement startup while a valid Stop cannot
miss it after a rewrite. The final alias scan also requires the current slot entry to retain
its captured slot identity and original lexical directory, whether the rewritten path is
equivalent or different. Every turn awaiting that scan also holds a process-owned
pre-publication token; Stop and Delete provisionally revoke matching tokens by normalized
directory, verified name, or slot before waiting for any directory spelling, so a control
that completes through a rewritten entry cannot be followed by an older task publication.
Pending tokens and handoff execution claims also exclude a different identity view by
normalized directory, verified slot, or name, so
rewriting the index during either request's final scan cannot start a second generation under
a different lock. An exact published identity still accepts established same-slot queuing.
Ownership transfers to the published slot task and follows queued successor turns until
the slot is idle, and an autonomous handoff retains ownership across idle gaps for the
lifetime of its armed nudge loop. Stop and Delete capture both the claimed slot and its
loop identity before revoking them, so an index rewrite cannot make a running turn or a
later nudge unreachable through the new slot key. The process retains the creation's first
authenticated directory as well as its slot key, so a generic embedded-chat turn is still
reachable when the agent rewrites its name, directory, and slot together. An observed creation
with no remaining valid index binding is included in dispatch admission and every authenticated
Stop/Delete teardown; a successful Delete releases every captured slot witness across old names,
not only the name on the current row. A surviving observed name remains its creation's control
endpoint even when the raw row removes, corrupts, or replaces its slot key, so an unrelated teardown
cannot misclassify and archive it as a global orphan. Index workers publish observed-name and
observed-directory witness maps by whole-map replacement; event-loop admission and teardown
readers therefore traverse stable snapshots rather than dictionaries a worker thread can resize.
Durable nudge loops participate in
dispatch admission after restart and are matched by verified name ownership or their original
sentinel directory; cold-start name and directory witnesses survive a missing or invalid raw
slot key, and an empty global scan never treats an unrelated empty sentinel as a direct match.
A loop whose name, directory, and slot no longer match any valid index
entry is treated as an orphan: dispatch fails closed and Stop/Delete captures it, because no
replacement entry can safely claim exclusive ownership of that unattended run. When no index
entry remains to provide a Stop/Delete URL, Create opens a service-owned maintenance transaction
even when AutoNudge is disabled. The transaction is serialized with service startup and peer
cleanup, persistently pauses each orphan, waits for both the captured firing callback and a timer
replacement installed during that pause, then re-reads and archives its worker before any
worktree, spec-directory, or index side effect. The inactive loop
remains as a restart-durable recovery marker until every worker archive succeeds, so a timeout or
crash cannot make a retry forget the old turn. A failed final loop-store removal restores the
in-memory marker and emits no removal event, so the next cleanup can retry the durable delete.
This also covers a direct embedded-chat turn with no loop. Cleanup or transcript-archive failure refuses Create so the old worker cannot overlap the
replacement, and successful recovery removes the loop and releases the old process witness before
the new creation mints its slot key. Detail status also follows a restored
loop by its sentinel
directory, keeping Pause visible when the current row carries a rewritten slot key. Once a
process observes a per-creation slot key, an agent-written different key for that name cannot
change the live slot resolver. Detail and destructive controls use that authenticated key for
the worker while retaining the raw key only as the compare-and-swap identity of the mutable
index row. App-owned deletion or create rollback releases every captured spelling so a
same-name recreation can mint a new worker. A legacy entry
without `slot_key` is upgraded
atomically to its name-derived identity only when this process has not already observed a
per-creation key for that name; removing a live worker's key therefore fails closed instead of
being misread as an upgrade.
New-spec registration also returns 503 before mutation or seed dispatch when the protected
decision ledger cannot be read, because transient unreadability cannot prove an alias safe.
Pre-consumption automatic retries carry
the settlement callback on their process-local queue entry, including across repeated
retries; a gateway restart drops that callback deliberately and the durable pending entry
re-arms it on replay. This file is therefore an **input to the
refusal and recovery path**, not a setting. An agent able to write it could erase an entry
to make a settled decision answerable again, forge one to lock a decision the user never
answered, or plant a pending prompt for the backend to relay. It lives under the
whole-directory `trust` entry rather than getting a leaf of its own, because gating the
leaf alone left its parent replaceable: a directory under `workspace/` is not itself a
sensitive path, so one `ln -s` naming it redirected every read and write — the app opens
the path directly, as keystone writers must, so it would have followed the link. It is
also deliberately NOT a field on the app's `index.json`, which is agent-writable by
design.

**Ops Mission Control authorization inputs** (`apps/ops-mission-control/data/rotation.yaml`,
`apps/ops-mission-control/data/incidents/index.json`) — two app-owned files that are
write-protected on both layers for the same reason as the marker above, and with the same
read/write asymmetry. They are not settings and no load-time clamp neutralizes a forged value:
they are **inputs to an authorization decision**.

- `rotation.yaml` is the committed on-call schedule. An agent that rewrites it to name its own
  login makes `rotation.authorize_action` → `_definitely_off_shift` accept a forged shift and
  execute an off-shift production write against a teammate's incident tooling.
- `incidents/index.json` is the incident store. `/incident/action` reads the incident by id and
  hands `incident.signal` to the same gate, whose act-rules key on `source` / `resource` /
  `labels` — so an agent that rewrites the record can pair a resource an operator's rule
  authorizes with a *different* provider target, and the gate approves one signal while the sink
  mutates another. Resolving the signal server-side (the fix used for the same defect on
  `/incident/claim`) cannot help, because the store IS the server's copy.

Both stay **readable** on the tool path, and that is load-bearing rather than incidental: every
teammate's instance must read the schedule to answer "am I on call?", and the index is the board
the dashboard renders. Neither holds a secret, so neither is in `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`.
`_WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS` protects file-edit writes only; the shell-command gate matches no
paths. The gateway's writers (`store.claim` / `update_fields`, and `ledger_sync`'s `git checkout`
on the schedule) open these paths directly and do not route through the tool gate, so the app and
team sync keep working.

**Downloaded model weights** (`<data home>/models`) are write-protected at the file-edit tool boundary because the speech and embedding loaders verify a digest and then reopen the file by path. `models` is a directory entry in `_WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS`, so `is_sensitive_write_path()` refuses edits anywhere below it while `is_sensitive_path()` continues to allow reads. The shell-command gate matches no paths; this section therefore claims no Bash text-layer protection. `test_security.py::TestModelWeightsAreWriteProtected` pins that boundary.

**App-sources checkouts** (`app-sources/`) — the persistent tree every installed app *executes*
from (`apps.registry.app_source_dir` → `<data-home>/app-sources/{name}`). The entry is a whole
DIRECTORY rather than a leaf, which `_path_in_home_dirs` already supports: it matches the entry
and its `entry + os.sep` prefix, so every file under every checkout is covered without
enumerating them.

This is the strongest instance of the write-only class, because the protected file *is* the
executed code rather than an input to a decision about it — an agent with ordinary file-write
tools could edit an installed app's source, which then runs with that app's privileges on the
app's next launch. Nothing downstream neutralizes it: unlike `config.json`, whose inflated values
the load-time clamp below rewrites, a modified checkout is simply run. Provenance does not catch
it either — `install_from_registry` records `_resolved_clone_commit` (the tree's real `HEAD`), and
an agent write dirties the worktree without moving `HEAD`, so a modified tree still reports the
pinned SHA.

- **File-edit tool gate only**, deliberately: `app-sources` is in
  `_WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS`, so `is_sensitive_write_path()` refuses agent
  file edits below it. The shell-command gate matches no paths, which keeps
  ordinary source reads available but also means this entry is not a Bash
  text-layer write fence. Reads stay allowed; `app-sources` is not in
  `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`.
- The gateway's own installer is unaffected: `_clone_build_app` clones, builds and prunes through
  direct Python/subprocess calls, which are not agent tool calls and never reach
  `hooks.on_tool_call`.
- An installed app's *data* directory (`apps/{name}/data/`) is a different tree and stays
  writable — apps persist state there through the agent's own tools.

**Load-time resource-limit clamp** (`config/loader.py`) — defends against a config-loader bound bypass: the dashboard config API rejects out-of-range writes, but a direct edit of `config.json` bypasses that gate.
- `KiroCrewConfig.load()` calls `_clamp_security_bounds(data)` on the disk-read path before caching. `_SECURITY_BOUNDED_FIELDS` is the authoritative field-and-limit table; dedicated follow-up checks preserve documented zero sentinels while enforcing non-zero floors for `agent.max_subagents` and `agent.subagent_timeout_secs`.
- The dashboard API and runtime consumers import the same ceiling constants rather than duplicating values.
- Every clamp is logged at WARNING and emits a best-effort `config_bounds_clamped` SEL event; config loading never fails because the audit write failed.

**URL exfiltration detection** — scans LLM output before posting to Slack/dashboard:
- `scan_exfiltration_urls(text)` — flags the payload not the destination (host-agnostic except the two narrow carve-outs below)
- Detects: long query strings (≥200 chars), base64 blobs (40+ chars counting trailing padding: `[A-Za-z0-9+/]{40,}={0,2}|[A-Za-z0-9+/]{39}=|[A-Za-z0-9+/]{38}==`, the same spelling as the frontend `EXFIL_B64_RE`), heavy URL-encoding, AWS access key IDs (`AKIA`/`ASIA`), SSH keys, private key headers, Slack tokens
- In the base64 branch `=` is trailing padding only, never a joiner (#14784): with `=` inside the class, a parameter name, its `=` and a short value fused into one run, so `trainingId=` plus a 32-char ID read as a 43-char blob. Standard base64 carries `=` only at the end, so a real encoded value still forms one run, and the padding still counts toward the 40, so a 28- or 29-byte payload (38 + `==`, 39 + `=`) is caught. **Residual, stated rather than implied:** a payload split into sub-40 chunks is bounded only by `_EXFIL_QUERY_MIN_LEN` (200), whether the separator is `=` or `&`, `.`, `-`, `_`, which were already outside the class, so `=` adds no split an attacker did not have. `test/test_exfil_base64_padding.py` and `website/src/test/sanitizeExfiltrationBase64Padding.test.ts` pin both directions.
- Hard credential markers (`_HARD_CREDENTIAL_RE`) are scanned across the **full path AND query**, not just the query after `?`, so a secret embedded in the URL path (`http://host/AKIA…`, no `?`) is caught (Talos 78224f3f). `_URL_RE` matches DNS names, **raw IPv4 literals** (incl. IMDS `169.254.169.254`), and **bracketed IPv6 literals** so a raw-IP exfil destination is not silently skipped. `_URL_RE`'s path/query group starts with `[/?]`, so a query attached **directly to the host with no path segment** (`https://host?leak=<secret>`) is captured and scanned too — previously that group required a leading `/`, so such a URL yielded no path/query group and both scan/redact bailed on `qmark == -1`, skipping the query entirely (exfil bypass). The base64-blob/query-length heuristics stay query-only (long base64 path segments — CDN asset ids, git object hashes — are benign); the S3-presigned exemption is applied before the path scan. Per-URL classification is a single shared helper (`_exfil_url_warning`) used by both scan and redact so the two paths cannot drift. **Exact-host heuristic exemption**: a companion `CredentialPolicy` may supply a set of trusted-tenant hosts (`_exempt_exact_hosts()`; the public Default returns an empty set) that skip **only** the base64-blob and query-length heuristics — the ones that false-positive on legitimate long base64 document pointers (e.g. SharePoint `nav=` links). Hosts are matched **case-insensitively** (both the captured host and the set members are lowercased, per RFC 4343) and **exactly** (not by suffix, so a shared multi-tenant domain does not exempt every tenant). The hard-credential floor (`_HARD_CREDENTIAL_RE`) **and** the heavy percent-encoding detector (`_EXFIL_PERCENT_RE`) stay **unconditional** — an AWS key / SSH-or-PEM header / Slack token / URL-encoded payload on an exempted host is still flagged and redacted. **Self-emitted Slack app-create link carve-out**: `kirocrew manifest --url` (`cli_setup.py`) and `GET /api/slack/manifest` (`handlers/messaging.py`) both hand the user Slack's new-app deep link with the bundled app manifest percent-encoded into `manifest_yaml`. That payload is ~1.9 KB, so the query-length heuristic classified the link as exfiltration and the user was shown `[REDACTED: suspicious URL to api.slack.com]` instead of the link `docs/guides/slack-setup.md` tells them to click. `_kirocrew_slack_app_link_alias()` skips **only** the base64-blob and query-length heuristics, and it earns that by VALIDATING the payload rather than trusting the destination: exact `https` host `api.slack.com` + exact path `/apps`, no explicit port, the query's parameter set exactly `{new_app, manifest_yaml}` (a superset is refused — an extra parameter is the obvious smuggling shape), `new_app` exactly `1`, and the decoded manifest must `fullmatch` a pattern derived from `slack_manifest.stripped_template()` — the SAME render/strip procedure both emitters use, so the accepted payload cannot drift from the emitted one (`{{ALIAS}}` → a bounded alias group, every later occurrence a backreference so the alias cannot vary between the two places the manifest names it). **The alias does not ride free.** The helper returns the captured alias and the caller assigns it to `heuristic_query`, so the one caller-controlled span stays under the base64-blob heuristic; only the constant template bytes (which caused the false positive) are excluded. Zeroing the payload instead was a real bypass found in review on #2725: the alias slot accepted 64 chars of `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, wide enough for a 40-char alphanumeric secret, which is exactly the run length `_EXFIL_PATTERNS` needs — `slack_manifest.ALIAS_MAX` (32) now makes such a run impossible AND the surviving span is still scanned, so an `AKIA…` id or a short `xox…` token parked in the alias is caught on the alias alone. **Residual, stated rather than implied:** an alias up to `ALIAS_MAX` chars resembling no known credential is exempt from the base64/length heuristics; this opens no NEW capability, because any URL at any host may already carry a query under `_EXFIL_QUERY_MIN_LEN` (200) chars without tripping either heuristic, so the span is strictly narrower than what is available without the carve-out. An unreadable template yields `None` and **fails closed** (full heuristics restored), because an install that cannot prove what its own manifest looks like must not exempt a 1.9 KB payload. This is deliberately NOT modelled as a host exemption: `_exempt_exact_hosts()` is companion-owned tenant trust, and adding `api.slack.com` there would exempt every URL at that host including a model-authored one — the same reasoning by which the OAuth carve-out refuses to exempt OAuth-shaped params wherever they appear. Because it runs at the heuristic-query selection step, every unconditional check still precedes it: `_HARD_CREDENTIAL_RE`, the canonical fixed-credential patterns, the multi-pass percent-decode and its fail-closed saturation branch, and `_EXFIL_PERCENT_RE` — so a secret appended to an otherwise-valid manifest is still caught (`test_credential_in_payload_still_redacted`). `test_security.py::TestKiroCrewSlackAppCreateLink` pins both directions, driving the **real emitter** (`slack_manifest.deep_link`) through the scanner rather than rebuilding the payload — a rebuild would let an emitter drift away from the validator with the tests still green, which is the same "no test exercised the real URL" failure that hid the original bug.
- `redact_exfiltration_urls(text)` — replaces suspicious URLs with `[REDACTED: suspicious URL to {domain}]`. The substitution is built from the exported `EXFILTRATION_REDACTION_TAG_PREFIX` constant so the two cannot drift: the tag interpolates the domain, so a consumer that must detect the rewrite counts that constant **by prefix** rather than by equality — which is also why it is deliberately NOT a member of the constant-tag registry `CREDENTIAL_REDACTION_TAGS` (see below). A rewrite of a persisted chat body is never silent: every placeholder the dashboard renders carries its own record in the message meta (`redactions` for credential tags, `blocked_links` for URLs), and the renderer turns each into a labelled lock tag or a Blocked link chip that opens a card explaining it, so the reader sees what was removed at the place it was removed
- **Blocked-link records** (`redact_exfiltration_urls_with_records`): the same loop that redacts a URL returns one record per distinct URL — `domain`, `rule` (the stable id `_exfil_url_warning` reports), `path` (kept only when it passes both removers on its own), `query_chars`, and EXACTLY one of `url` (the full address) or `url_withheld` (`credential` | `length`). The full address is kept so a wrongly blocked link can be opened by the reader, and only when `_blocked_link_url_verdict` passes it: http(s), the record's own host, no userinfo, within `MAX_BLOCKED_LINK_URL_CHARS`, and `_credential_clean` — unchanged by `redact_credentials` as written AND in every bounded percent-decoded form, failing closed on saturation. The text is redacted the same way either way; the record rides the message meta, which the model replay never serializes. A transcript line is attacker-writable, so every record read back — on a row (`chat_utils._redact_meta_for_role`) or on a regenerate variant (`chat_utils._variant_for_emit`) — goes through `bounded_blocked_links`, which caps the count, bounds every retained string by `_BLOCKED_LINK_STRING_BOUNDS`, and re-runs `revalidate_blocked_link` on each serve, so a remover rule changed since the message was written applies before the address can be opened. **Allowed hosts** (`security/redaction_allow.py`, the sealed `redaction-allow/` leaf): *Allow for this host* relaxes only the length and base64 heuristics for that host in one workspace, and only when a reply is SHOWN. A reply is always saved and reloaded with every blocked link as a placeholder plus its record; the history render (`chat_utils._prepare_messages`) and the live `chat_message` frame (`state._broadcast_chat_message`) put an allowed host's address back through `restore_allowed_links`, then run the display redaction under the same scope. So a saved transcript never depends on the list: before the list has loaded (it loads on first read, off the boot path) a link simply shows as blocked, and revoking a host re-blocks every link on it. The allowance is for opening on a click, never for a zero-click fetch: `/api/link-meta` refuses (`400 blocked_url`, before the cache key exists) any URL the redactors would change with no allowed-host scope, so a restored link is never previewed. Credential checks are never relaxed. The dashboard chip (`MarkdownRenderer` `BlockedLinkChip`) shows the full address only in its opened card, opens it only on *Open once* (`window.open(…, 'noopener,noreferrer')`, re-checking host and scheme at the click), never renders it as an anchor, and remembers nothing.
- **Frontend mirror** (`website/src/utils/sanitize.ts::sanitizeExfiltrationUrls`): the browser-side redactor reuses the SIGNALS of `_exfil_url_warning` but layers them differently, and in the strict direction: on the backend base64 and length sit together on the waivable tier, both applied to `heuristic_query` after a span-subtraction step, whereas here every **pattern** signal is unconditional, running for every URL with no host and no carve-out able to escape it — `EXFIL_PERCENT_RE` (20+ consecutive percent-octets, mirroring `_EXFIL_PERCENT_RE`), `EXFIL_CREDENTIAL_RE` (AWS key id / SSH-or-PEM header / Slack token, mirroring `_HARD_CREDENTIAL_RE`) and `EXFIL_B64_RE` (40+ char base64 blob) — so the redactor flags every pattern an undifferentiated check would. **Two** signals false-positive on the prefilled GitHub issue link of the report (`…/issues/new?title=…&body=<prose>&labels=…`, rendered as `[REDACTED: suspicious URL to github.com]` in chat), and NEITHER of them is waived. Aggregate query length (`EXFIL_QUERY_MIN_LEN`, 200) names no pattern at all — it fires on any richly-parameterised URL — and it is the check `isPrefilledIssueUrl()` used to waive, and no longer does — that predicate is deleted. `EXFIL_B64_RE` is the second: `+` is the form-encoded spelling of a space, which is what `URLSearchParams` emits, so ~7 words of unpunctuated prose in a `+`-encoded `body=` are one 40+ char run in `[A-Za-z0-9+/]`. That signal is left **in force on purpose and is not waivable**: narrowing the class to exclude `+`, or splitting the query on `+` before testing, would let an attacker `+`-chunk a 40+ char secret straight past it, which costs more than the false positive does. So a prefilled issue query is redacted in chat whichever way its spaces are spelled — `%20` on the length signal, `+` on the base64 one — and both spellings are pinned as deliberate by `sanitizeExfiltrationUrls.test.ts`. `isPrefilledIssueUrl()` is **removed** (it landed for #7824 and was withdrawn here), because no validation of a URL can earn a length waiver for MODEL-AUTHORED text: injected content steers the model into emitting a prefill URL whose `body` carries percent-encoded private context, the waiver skips the length check, the link renders as the familiar "file an issue" affordance, the user submits it, and the issue is **public** so the attacker reads it. Pinning the repository to this project's own tracker does not close that — the tracker is world-readable by design, which is the point of it. A URL's shape says nothing about who authored it, and a marker placed IN the text travels in the channel the injection already controls, so provenance must come from a different channel; the product already has one (see the structured-action bullet below). That is closer to the backend's `_kirocrew_slack_app_link_alias()` than to the companion-owned `_exempt_exact_hosts()` tier, but it is not the same move: the backend precedent keeps the caller-controlled span under **both** heuristics by narrowing the payload down to it, which is unavailable here because every GitHub prefill parameter value is caller-controlled and there is no constant-template span to subtract — so what is waived here is one signal rather than one span. For the record, the withdrawn predicate validated: exact `https` scheme, host exactly `github.com` (lowercased per RFC 4343, never by suffix, so `github.com.evil.example` is a different host), **no explicit port**, path `fullmatch`ing this repository's own `issues/new`, and every query key drawn from GitHub's documented prefill set. All of that was sound, and none of it mattered — which is the lesson worth keeping: validating a URL establishes what it points at, never who authored it. **No residual, because nothing is waived:** a query at or over `EXFIL_QUERY_MIN_LEN` is redacted at every host and every path, with no shape, scheme, port or destination exception. That opens no new encoding capability, because a query under 200 chars at ANY host already rides through both without the carve-out; and the carve-out that would have added length at one shape is gone, so nothing is added at all. The exposure also begins at the CLICK rather than at the submit: following the rendered link hands the whole query string to github.com's servers and logs before the user decides whether to file anything, and only after that does the submitted issue land in whichever repository the URL named. The frontend does not percent-decode, so its markers are literal only, and `URL_RE`'s path/query group still requires a leading `/` — so `https://host?leak=<secret>` yields no group and its query is never scanned. That is the bypass the backend closed by starting `_URL_RE`'s group with `[/?]`; it is pre-existing here, untouched by this carve-out, and the reason this bullet claims signal parity rather than wiring parity. One wiring divergence runs the other way (#8638): `URL_RE` still stops at `)` like the backend's (#7611), but a URL that stops there is judged together with the text after it, up to the next scheme or whitespace (`URL_TAIL_RE`), so `https://host/a)b?token=<secret>` has its query scanned. That span is then cut back to where the renderer ends the link: a markdown `[label](…)` target at its first unbalanced `)` (`linkTarget`, taken only when a real `[label]` precedes the `](`, found by `closesLabel`, and honouring a CommonMark `\)` escape); outside a link the same first-unpaired-`)` cut is used whenever it already keeps the query's `?`, so glued prose after a wrapper `)` is never scanned or spliced, and otherwise the query lies past the `)` and the span is kept, dropping only an unbalanced trailing wrapper `)` (`trimWrapperParen`). Only that cut span is scanned and replaced, by splicing at the match offset, so text outside a real link never votes on it and glued neighbouring markdown survives. Every tail stops before the next scheme, so each character joins at most one tail and the pass stays linear. It introduces **no regex lookbehind** (the file is in the eagerly-loaded entry chunk; at the `safari14` esbuild target a lookbehind literal is rewritten to `new RegExp()` and throws at module load, blanking the dashboard) and keeps the JWT credential-pattern parity pinned by `test/test_redaction_mirror_parity.py`. Both directions are covered by `website/src/test/sanitizeExfiltrationUrls.test.ts`, which pins the length signal as applying at every host and path, and each pattern signal as unwaived.
- **Why there is no backend twin of the prefilled-issue carve-out** (the `_exfil_url_warning` length gate is unconditional): the frontend waiver above could never take effect on the surfaces users actually reported (#7820), because **the backend redacts first**. Chat segments (`chat_runner`), persisted history (`chat_persistence`) and artifact serialization (`handlers/artifacts._serialize`) all call `redact_exfiltration_urls` server-side, so the browser receives `[REDACTED: suspicious URL to github.com]` as literal text and has no URL left to waive. When a signal is mirrored on two sides and one runs first, **the stricter side decides**, so a waiver added only to the later side is inert — which is why signal parity here is a correctness property and not tidiness. A backend twin WAS added and then withdrawn, in two spellings — validating the shape, then additionally pinning the path to `/kirodotdev/KiroCrew/issues/new` — because both are exfiltration primitives on model-authored text: the waiver skips the length check on a URL whose `body` an injection filled with percent-encoded private context, the user submits the familiar "file an issue" link, and the issue is **public** so the attacker reads it. A world-readable tracker is not a safe destination, it is a slower one. **The feature that needed the waiver has a channel instead, and it already shipped:** `diagnostics._issue_url` assembles the prefill query from STRUCTURED fields (`version`, `channel`, `what-happened`, `context`, `install`) with `urlencode`, hands it to the dashboard as `BundleResult.github_issue_url` on a JSON response **no redactor scans**, and `ReportProblemModal` / `ReportProblemCard` render their own `<a href={result.github_issue_url}>`. Nothing on that path is text a model wrote, so nothing on it needs a waiver — and note those field names are GitHub issue-**form** keys, which the withdrawn allow-list never contained, so the waiver only ever served links the MODEL typed. For paths that DO get relayed through prose, `terminal_issue_url` is the bounded variant: it drops the two free-form fields so the query is bounded by construction (~140 chars) and survives the unwaived check. Every unconditional check still runs BEFORE it (`_HARD_CREDENTIAL_RE`, the fixed-credential patterns, the multi-pass percent-decode and its fail-closed saturation branch, `_EXFIL_PERCENT_RE`) and the base64-blob branch of `_EXFIL_PATTERNS` still runs AFTER, so a credential parked in a documented parameter is caught on the pattern alone and the `+`-encoded prose spelling stays redacted on both sides. **Nothing had to be carved back out of authentication:** while the waiver existed, `oauth_url_contains_credential` had to pass `allow_prefilled_issue=False`, because that predicate admits an OAuth banner URL over ACP and widening it there would have relaxed an admission gate rather than a renderer. With no waiver anywhere that opt-out is gone too, and the gate is one fewer flag away from being wrong. `test_redaction_mirror_parity.py::TestPrefilledIssueCarveOutParity` now pins the ABSENCE on both halves, reading each enforcing source at run time: no `_is_prefilled_issue_url` / `allow_prefilled_issue` / `_ISSUE_PREFILL_*` as executable code anywhere in the `security/` package (swept tree-wide, not per module, since #9183 split it), no `isPrefilledIssueUrl` / `EXFIL_ISSUE_*` in `sanitize.ts`, the length comparison unconditional at its own site on each side (so a waiver spelled with fresh identifiers still fails), and the structured channel still present — because deleting the waivers is only free while that seam exists. A waiver reintroduced on ONE half is silent: the backend redacts first on every server-rendered surface, so a frontend-only waiver leaves both suites green while opening the hole on any client-only render path. **Out of scope, stated rather than implied:** a long query at a host with no validated shape (the `monitorportal.amazon.com` case in the same report) is still redacted by aggregate length — waiving that names no shape at all and is a ceiling decision, not a false-positive fix.

**App-facing seam (`ctx.scrub`)** — an installed app that sends content off the
machine (an external document store, a ticket, a wiki) needs these same two passes,
and `apps/scrub_sdk.py` is how it gets them. **It finishes the text through
`redact_via_context`, not the baseline** — the seam is an egress boundary, so it
routes through the active `CredentialPolicy` and a loaded companion's extra token
and cookie regexes apply; calling `security.redact*` alone would be companion-blind
and let a companion-only token reach whatever the app published. `redact_with_findings`
still runs first, but only to COUNT what it recognised — the seam reports
`credentials_removed` / `urls_removed` and drops the warning strings, because
`_exfil_url_warning` embeds the offending domain in every branch and the first 60
chars of path+query on the long-query branch, which is precisely where a token that
escaped the credential patterns sits; passing those to an app documented as safe to
log would relocate a secret from the published text into the app's log. A count
cannot carry a payload however core later phrases a warning, and
the policy pass runs over its result, so an app's published text is never less
redacted than the gateway's own boundaries. It is fail-closed: a
`PlatformCompositionError` propagates out of `outbound` rather than downgrading to
the OSS baseline. Because a companion can remove a token no base warning names,
`ScrubResult.redacted` is set by the SDK from the base warnings OR the policy's
delta — it can be True with both lists empty, and is never False when something was
removed. `ScrubSDK.outbound` is its ONLY method and it holds no redaction knowledge
of its own: the sequencing lives in `redact_with_findings`, which
sits beside `redact` and is the single home of the URLs-then-credentials order —
redacting a credential first leaves a placeholder inside a URL that the
exfiltration matcher then fails to recognise, so that sequencing is a security
property and belongs in one place rather than re-spelled per caller (several
existing callers hand-sequence the reverse order; migrating them is separate).
Two further properties are deliberate: the seam is populated for EVERY app with no
permission gating it (it only removes data, and an app refused the seam ships its
own regexes instead — a control that looks present and is not), and it carries no
app identity, because nothing it does is attributed or recorded. An app must not
copy these patterns: `test_scrub_sdk.py` pins that patching the core pass changes
the SDK's answer, which a copy could not satisfy, and pins the public surface at
exactly `outbound` so a second spelling cannot accrete.

**Credential output redaction** — catches raw credential patterns in LLM/tool output:
- `redact_credentials(text)` — scans for plaintext AND base64-encoded credentials
- Plaintext patterns: `AKIA`/`ASIA` access key IDs, `SecretAccessKey=`, `aws_secret_access_key=`, `SessionToken=`, `aws_session_token=`, PEM private keys (`-----BEGIN [A-Z ]*PRIVATE KEY-----`), Slack tokens (`xoxb-`/`xoxp-`)
- **Full-block PEM redaction** (`05687e60`): the PEM sub-alternative spans the ENTIRE key block (header + base64 body up to the END marker), not just the header phrase. Because `redact_credentials()` replaces the matched SPAN, a header-only match left the secret base64 body verbatim on every output surface. The body class is `[\s\S]*?` (not base64-only) so encrypted keys — whose `Proc-Type:`/`DEK-Info:` headers carry `:`/`,` — are fully spanned; a truncated block (no END) consumes only subsequent PEM body lines (each must start with a newline), so a `BEGIN` header mentioned inline in prose matches only the header and does not swallow trailing lines to end-of-string. **Round-3:** the trailing `(?=\r?\n[A-Za-z0-9+/=])` lookahead alternative lets the run cross a SINGLE blank line when the next line begins with base64 material — RFC 1421 ENCRYPTED PEMs place a MANDATORY blank line between the `DEK-Info:` header and the base64 body, and without this lookahead the per-line "must contain a base64 char" rule stopped at that blank line and leaked the whole encrypted body (for both a truncated key and a complete encrypted key whose body exceeds the full-block cap). Because the lookahead consumes nothing, TWO+ consecutive blank lines still terminate the run, so trailing prose is preserved (no over-redaction)
- **Third-party provider families**: ~12 distinctive fixed-prefix token formats added beyond AWS/Slack — GitHub (`ghp_`/`gho_`/`ghu_`/`ghs_`/`ghr_` PATs + `github_pat_` fine-grained), GitLab (`glpat-`), Stripe (`sk_live_`/`rk_live_`/`_test_`), SendGrid (`SG.`), OpenAI (`sk-proj-`), Anthropic (`sk-ant-`), npm (`npm_`), PyPI (`pypi-`), DigitalOcean (`dop_v1_`/`doo_`/`dor_`), Google OAuth client secrets (`GOCSPX-`) — plus DB connection URIs with embedded credentials (`postgres`/`mysql`/`mongodb`/`redis`/`amqp` `://user:pass@`). Prefixes are case-sensitive with minimum lengths set slightly below real token lengths (over-redaction on a prefix match is the safe direction)
- **JSON-aware key-value matching**: key-value patterns allow an optional quote (`[\"']?`) between the key name and the separator (`[:=]`), matching both bare `aws_secret_access_key=VALUE` and JSON `"aws_secret_access_key": "VALUE"` formats. The value class uses `[^\s"',}]+` (bounded, stops at JSON structural delimiters) rather than greedy `\S+`, preventing over-capture in compact JSON that would swallow adjacent fields and mask subsequent credentials
- **JWT / JWE / OAuth Bearer tokens** (cc1d6bdd; JWE hardening a8e5fe6a; JSON-aware Bearer): JWTs (`eyJ<header>.<payload>.<sig>` — `eyJ` is the base64url of the `{"` header prefix) and HTTP `Authorization: Bearer <token>` headers. The `eyJ` segment quantifier is `(?:\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]*){2,4}` so it redacts both a 3-segment signed JWT (JWS) and a 5-segment encrypted JWT (JWE, RFC 7516 — `header.encrypted_key.iv.ciphertext.tag`) as one whole token — including `dir`/`ECDH-ES` JWEs whose Encrypted Key segment is EMPTY (`header..iv.ciphertext.tag`); the earlier fixed 3-segment pattern truncated a JWE and leaked its ciphertext + tag. The JWT alternative is case-sensitive (`eyJ` is a fixed base64url prefix); the Bearer header name + scheme are matched case-insensitively via scoped `(?i:…)` groups because HTTP header names are case-insensitive (RFC 7230 §3.2), HTTP/2 mandates lowercase names, and the `Bearer` scheme is case-insensitive (RFC 6750 §2.1) — so lowercase `authorization: bearer …` from `requests`/`net/http`/HTTP2 frame logs is redacted too. The header/scheme separator is JSON-aware: an optional quote may precede the `:`/`=` and the token (`(?i:Authorization)["']?\s*[:=]\s*["']?(?i:Bearer)…`), so a serialized `{"Authorization": "Bearer <tok>"}` in a structured-log/JSON request dump is redacted, not just the raw HTTP header. Both are scoped tightly — the JWT segment class `[A-Za-z0-9_-]` cannot cross the literal `.` separators, and the Bearer token class (`[A-Za-z0-9._~+/-]+=*`, RFC 6750 `b64token`) stops at whitespace/quotes — so neither over-captures. A `Bearer` header carrying a JWT redacts as a single match (the Bearer alternative's class subsumes the JWT), while a bare JWT is caught independently (defense in depth). Bare `eyJ…` with no `.`-segments and the word `Bearer` without the `Authorization:` prefix are NOT redacted (no false positives). The JWS/JWE branch is shape-only, so a hit on it counts only when its first segment base64url-decodes to a JSON object (a JOSE header, or the payload of an itsdangerous / Flask-session token): `honeyJar.example.com` is left alone. Every pass-1 consumer and the stream's partial-JWT holdback anchor apply the check. A rejected span is rescanned, so a credential inside it still redacts. A header holding a second `eyJ` stays a credential, which keeps the rescan linear. The `sanitize.ts` mirror still matches on shape alone. **Two-segment dashboard link token**: `dashboard.token_auth.generate_token` emits `base64url(payload).base64url(hmac_sig)`, which is TWO segments, so the `{2,4}` quantifier never matched it and the token fell through to the pass-3 bare-secret heuristic, whose run class `[A-Za-z0-9+/]` is standard base64 and excludes base64url's `-`/`_`. Redaction therefore depended on the alphabet of a random HMAC signature. That rate is derivable, so it is stated as a closed form rather than as a sample: HMAC-SHA256 is 256 bits and base64url-unpadded gives 43 chars, of which the first 42 each carry a full 6 bits (uniform over the 64-char alphabet, exactly 2 of which are `-`/`_`) while the 43rd carries only the leftover 4 bits (256 - 42*6) in the HIGH bits of its 6-bit group, low 2 bits zero, so it spans exactly the 16 alphabet indices divisible by 4 (`048AEIMQUYcgkosw`), never `-`/`_` at 62/63 (verified by encoding all 256 possible final digest bytes). Hence P(no `-`/`_`) = `(62/64)^42` = 26.4%, so roughly a quarter of tokens had only the signature replaced and the payload claims stayed verbatim in a URL that still looked complete but no longer authenticated; the other ~74% were emitted with no redaction at all. (An earlier 400-signature estimate published 29% here. Two 5000-mint runs land at 26.0% and 27.1%, straddling the closed form, so the published figure was a small-sample artefact.) The link token now has its OWN alternative, `(?<![A-Za-z0-9_.-])eyJ[A-Za-z0-9_-]{96,}\.[A-Za-z0-9_-]{43}(?![A-Za-z0-9_-])`, ordered AFTER the `{2,4}` one so a real JWS still redacts whole instead of matching `header.payload` and leaving `.signature` exposed. The `{2,4}` floor was deliberately NOT relaxed to `{1,4}`: the alternative has no left boundary and its post-header segments allow an EMPTY match, so `{1,4}` matches ordinary code and prose (`keyJson.get(raw)` becomes `k[REDACTED: credential](raw)`, and a JWT quoted at the end of a sentence loses its trailing period). The segment lengths come from the generator rather than from guesswork, because a length FLOOR alone is beatable by a verbose enough identifier: at `{40,}` the 40-char `eyJsonSerializerConfigurationFactoryBuilder.deserializeFromStringValue` matched. `token_auth._sign` is HMAC-SHA256 base64url-unpadded, so the signature is EXACTLY 43 chars for every token ever minted, a property of the digest and not of the payload, so it is pinned as `{43}`; `test_link_token_signature_is_43_chars` fails loudly if that digest changes rather than letting redaction silently stop matching. `generate_token` always emits `sub`/`exp`/`session_exp`/`iat`/`nonce`/`gen` with a 16-hex-char nonce and float timestamps (`app`, `prompt` and `extra` only add), so payload length is not fixed: it scales with `len(sub)` and with the repr width of each float timestamp, which base64 quantises into 4-char steps. The floor is therefore derived rather than sampled: a 1-char `sub` (the narrowest a caller passes), `gen=0`, and all three timestamps at their shortest 12-char repr (an exactly-integral `time.time()` in the current 10-digit epoch era) measures 145 chars past `eyJ`, leaving the `{96,}` floor 49 chars of headroom. ONLY that derived floor is pinned; live payload sizes are not, because the spread moves with float reprs and caller mix (measured 168-185 for the mandatory-only callers, and 192-223 for the two that also pass `app=`, which adds an `"app"` claim). `test_link_token_payload_clears_the_96_char_floor` pins the derived floor so a shorter claim set fails loudly instead of silently disabling redaction. The left boundary includes `.` so an attribute access (`obj.eyJsonReader.readValueFromInputStream`) is excluded. A false positive here is not purely cosmetic: `chat_runner.py` redacts file-diff chip bodies IN PLACE before persistence ("so both the live and persisted views are clean"), so a bad match is written to the persisted view with no recovery path. Artifact content and compressed history are redacted on the serialization/output path instead (`handlers/artifacts.py::_serialize`), so those surfaces are not rewritten on disk. The product's own link delivery is unaffected by construction: `slack/allowlist.py::send_dashboard_link` builds the presigned URL and posts it via `slack.post_message` without calling `redact_credentials()` (and `slack/client.py` does not redact internally), so `!dashboard` and `kirocrew token` are outside this path. What the fix closes is an agent-authored URL carrying a live token into chat, which is the XPIA data-exfiltration row of the threat table above
- Base64 detection: finds 40+ char base64 chunks, decodes them, checks if decoded content matches any credential pattern
- **Bare label-less secret-key detection** (`bf7b1baf`): a 40-char AWS *secret access key* (the value paired with an `AKIA`/`ASIA` ID) is a bare base64 run with NO prefix and NO `key=` label, so the fixed-format patterns above miss it when it appears standalone (echoed alone, in a log line, in a JSON array element). A third redaction pass adds an entropy + structural heuristic: `_BARE_SECRET_RUN_RE` isolates each `[A-Za-z0-9+/]{40,}` run (word-boundary look-arounds so surrounding prose is preserved), then `_looks_like_secret_key()` applies every gate below — a token must clear ALL of them (design bias is toward NOT redacting: a false negative reverts to prior behavior, a false positive corrupts benign output). Gates, ordered by measured cost per rejection (cheapest first): (1) length is EXACTLY 40 (AWS secret-key length); (2) contains lower + upper + digit (rejects all-lower prose, ALL-UPPER constants, base32, digit runs); (3) not an all-hex run (`_HEX_ONLY_RE` rejects 40-char git SHAs and 32/64-char md5/sha256 digests — verified even for mixed-case hex that would otherwise clear the entropy gate); (4) the longest run of consecutive lowercase letters ≤ `_SECRET_MAX_LOWER_RUN` (5), decided by `_lowercase_run_exceeds(token, cap)`, which stops as soon as a run reaches `cap + 1` instead of measuring the longest run in the whole token; (5) vowel ratio ≤ `_SECRET_MAX_VOWEL_RATIO` (0.30); (6) Shannon entropy ≥ `_SECRET_ENTROPY_MIN` (4.3 bits/char — real random keys average ~4.78 and rarely drop below ~4.4, while camelCase identifiers and file paths cluster at 4.0-4.3; the canonical AWS example scores 4.66); (7) does not base64-decode to ≥85% printable ASCII (`_decodes_to_printable_text` leaves encoded-text blobs to the decode-and-scan pass). **The order of gates 4-7 is a performance property, not a correctness one:** all four are pure predicates that return `False` on failure, so every permutation produces the same verdict on every input — which is exactly why a behavior test cannot pin it. Entropy used to run first and was therefore paid on every window that cleared gates 1-3, even though the two structural gates reject more per microsecond. Measured over the windows reaching this point: lowercase-run 1.65 µs at 66.5% rejection, vowel 2.89 µs at 62.3%, entropy 8.48 µs at 54.5%, decode 3.01 µs at 0%. Ordering by cost per rejection cut `redact_credentials()` on a 51 KB payload from 69.8 ms to 27.0 ms with byte-identical output. `TestSecretGateOrderIsCostOrdered` counts gate evaluations and fails if the order regresses to entropy-first; do not reorder these four back without re-measuring. Both structural gates apply to EVERY token: unlike a naive design, the presence of `/` or `+` is **not** a free pass to redact, so a 40-char mixed-case file path (e.g. `src/main/java/com/Example/FooBarBazClas1`) — which contains `/` yet is built from dictionary-word segments with long lowercase runs — stays intact. The pass scans the ORIGINAL text (stable offsets) and skips any run already redacted by pass 1/2. Tests (`test_security.py::TestBareSecretKeyRedaction`) prove true positives on real secret shapes and NO over-redaction of git SHAs, UUIDs, sha256/md5 hex, base32, prose, code identifiers, or slash-delimited file paths. **Glued-secret sliding window**: `_looks_like_secret_key()` only accepts an EXACTLY-40-char token (gate 1) — its documented boundary assumption — but `_BARE_SECRET_RUN_RE` captures the *longest* base64 run, so a real 40-char secret glued to an adjacent base64 char with no delimiter (`X`+secret, secret+`A`, `SECRET=`+secret+`ABC`, secret+`X`+secret) forms a 41+ char run that fails the exact-40 gate and would leak verbatim. Pass 3 therefore gates each captured run through `_contains_bare_secret()`, which slides a 40-char window across the run and redacts the whole run when ANY window clears every gate; this stays linear (the regex yields disjoint spans). A >40-char camelCase *identifier* run survives the slide (no window within it clears the structural gates), but a deep absolute *path* does not on its own: `/` is in the run alphabet, so a path such as `/Volumes/workplace/TRAM/QuickProp2/src/ATVTramQuickPropCDK/lib/config/consumerVpcs` is ONE run, and a window straddling several CamelCase components clears every gate (CamelCase caps its lowercase run, acronyms crush its vowel ratio, a version digit supplies the third class, the separators lift its entropy) — which redacted the whole path and left a file-viewer chip dereferencing `[REDACTED: credential].ts`. **Fragment separator ceiling** (`_SECRET_MAX_SLASHES`, 3): inside `_contains_bare_secret()`, a classifier-positive window is declined when it holds more than three `/` AND the run is longer than one key — separator density is what tells a path window (one `/` per component) from a key (`/` is 1 base64 character in 64, so a real key averages 0.6). Two conditions keep it a gate rather than a hole: it applies only to a FRAGMENT, so a standalone 40-char key is judged by the seven gates alone however many `/` it carries; and it is read AFTER `_looks_like_secret_key()` answers, so every offset is still classified and a key glued into a run is still found at its own offset. Measured on 200k uniformly random 40-char keys it declines 0.36% on its own, against 9.29% for the lowercase-run gate and 6.60% for the vowel-ratio gate. The accepted residual — a key carrying 4+ `/` AND glued into a longer run — is byte-identical to a benign path window at this layer and is pinned as a decision by `test_the_accepted_residual_is_a_separator_heavy_key_glued_into_a_run` (`TestPathWindowsAreNotBareSecrets`) **Document links** (`_DOCUMENT_LINK_RE`): a Google document id is ~44 random base64url characters, so a 40-char window inside it is byte-indistinguishable from a key and pass 3 would replace the whole `com/document/d/<id>/edit` run. Pass 3 therefore skips a run only when it lies wholly inside a link that matches a fixed route on a fixed host: HTTPS, a lowercase literal host right after the scheme (no userinfo, no port) of `docs.google.com`, `drive.google.com` or `<tenant>.atlassian.net`, and every path segment fixed or from a closed class (Google id `[A-Za-z0-9_-]{25,72}`, Confluence space key alphanumeric, page id digits); a piece of exactly 40 characters that `_looks_like_secret_key` accepts voids the match, with pieces cut once at `/` and the non-run characters `-_%.~` and once more at `+` (the space of a Confluence title slug), and a further base64-alphabet character after the route fails it. Query, fragment, userinfo, look-alike hosts and every pass 1, 2 and 4 hit are judged unchanged. The accepted residual is a key without `/` glued to more letters or digits inside the id or page title, or carrying its own `+` inside a title, which is indistinguishable from the id it sits in; about 2% of real Google ids carry a key-shaped 40-char piece between their random `-`/`_` and stay redacted (`test/test_document_link_redaction.py`).
- **`?token=` / `&token=` parameter-value redaction** (pass 4): the value of a `token` URL parameter is redacted keyed on the parameter NAME, not the value's shape, so an OPAQUE bearer value — one that looks nothing like a JWT — is caught where every shape-based pass sees ordinary text. `_TOKEN_PARAM_RE` (`[?&](?ai:token)=(<value class>+)`) replaces the VALUE only, keeping `token=` visible so a redacted URL still reads as a token URL. The parameter NAME folds ASCII case (scoped `(?ai:...)` — unlike `eyJ`, a parameter name is not a fixed encoding prefix, and `?Token=`/`?TOKEN=` from a third-party provider carries the same bearer value) while Unicode homoglyphs such as the Kelvin sign cannot spoof the parser-visible name, and additionally matches single percent-encoded spellings of each letter (`?to%6ben=`, `?%74%6F%6B%65%6E=`). Each letter also matches a bounded HTML reference to either case, and the percent escape's own three bytes are each HTML-spellable (`&#37;74`, `%&#55;&#52;`). This is the closure of the two modelled decoders, which is why the name ladder is generated from a byte-spelling table rather than hand-written. No WHATWG named reference decodes to an ASCII alphanumeric, so letters are numeric-only; `&percnt;` needs its semicolon while `&amp` does not. Standard parsers split on raw `&`/`=` FIRST, then percent-decode the name, so an encoded spelling authenticates as `token` while percent-encoded separators stay data to the consumer (encoded `%26`/`%3D` are split after, not before; double-encoding is out of scope — one decode yields `%74…`, not `token`). The separators and `=` additionally match the HTML-entity spellings an HTML5 parser decodes to that byte inside an attribute value BEFORE any query parser runs (`&amp;`/`&AMP;`/`&#38;`/`&#x26;` for `&`, `&quest;`/`&#63;` for `?`, `&equals;`/`&#61;` for `=`; numeric refs bounded at ≤8 leading zeros as a streaming-holdback DoS bound; semicolon-less `&amp`/`&AMP` only before a NON-alphanumeric per the WHATWG flush rule, and a PRESENT semicolon is always consumed as the reference's terminator (the zero-width flush alternative excludes `;`), so a reference cannot backtrack and hand its own terminator to the following value or name position; double HTML encoding declined on the same single-decode-per-stage doctrine — an earlier-stage decode is structure, a later-stage decode is data). The streaming partial holds back a chunk ending mid-escape (`…?to%6`); the value bytes are matched exactly as written. `StreamRedactor.feed()` computes its commit cut in two phases with named invariants: Phase A takes the minimum over all holdback rules (trailing cred-class run, PEM, Bearer, token-param anchors) and classifies anchors STRONG (JWT tail, Bearer, a complete `?token=` match crossing the cut, or a partial whose text contains `=`) vs WEAK (a bare `[?&]`+name prefix, ≤224 bytes even fully entity-and-percent-encoded); Phase B lets only STRONG anchors escalate the DoS cap or take the fail-closed drop past the ceiling — a WEAK prefix never authorizes data loss — and repairs any forced floor cut so it cannot bisect a complete token parameter (the cut advances past the value, which one batch-redaction call then redacts whole) or strand a WEAK prefix (the cut clamps back before the separator; more input either supplies `=`, making it STRONG, or breaks the prefix, so holdback stays bounded). The complete-match crossing predicate is one shared helper re-evaluated after every assignment to the cut, and it counts only a cut strictly INSIDE the value as a bisection — a cut at or one past the value's end leaves the whole `sep name = value` in the commit, which one batch call redacts whole, so a complete over-ceiling value with an in-buffer terminator commits as `token=[REDACTED: credential]` plus its trailing text instead of being dropped; STRONG token classification is structural (the partial's named `eq` group matched), never a `=` substring test. A strong-anchored fail-closed drop is not complete until the dropped run's CONTINUATION is also dropped: a sticky discard flag — armed only when the credential material provably reaches the buffer end (a `\Z`-anchored JWT/Bearer/token anchor, or a complete crossing whose value ends the buffer), never inferred from the last byte's shape — reaches a per-kind fixed point: later chunks are consumed only while bytes stay in the arming anchor's own value class (token-parameter, JWT base64url plus `.`, or RFC 6750 Bearer), and the first byte outside that class exits the discard unchanged — every 1 MiB of terminator-less continuation re-emits the tag, zeroes the counter and keeps discarding (the counter stays O(1) and the continuation never resumes raw; a later terminator still exits, so there is no permanent wedge) — and `flush()` while discarding emits nothing rather than redact-and-emitting an anchor-less remainder. The precedent is `instances/token_mint._TOKEN_RE` (`[?&]token=([^\s&]+)`), which one caller kept privately because the shared scrubber lacked the pass; the shared value class is wider-terminated: quotes and `#` (so a match cannot run past the parameter into a quoted string or a URL fragment) plus the RFC 3986-forbidden bytes `` <>{}|\^` `` — no legal URL query carries them, while SOURCE and DOC text quoting a token URL does (`?token={token}` in an f-string, `` ?token=` `` in markdown, `?token=<your-token>` in prose), and `chat_runner.py` redacts file snapshots IN PLACE, so a template match would rewrite a snapshot of `dashboard/urls.py` with no recovery path. ACCEPTED RESIDUAL: a template value made of legal query bytes (`?token=$TOKEN`, `?token=%s`) still matches and is redacted — the class excludes only bytes no legal query can carry (pinned by `test_source_and_doc_templates_not_matched` on the excluded side). A parameter name is a context — it cannot match a filename, an identifier or a sourcemap name — so the pass adds coverage without widening `JWT_MULTI_SEGMENT` or the two-segment link-token bounds (whose measured false positives are the reason those bounds stay put). Deliberately NOT a `_CREDENTIAL_PATTERNS` branch: a branch replaces its whole span (swallowing the `token=` anchor), and `_contains_fixed_credential` — which gates request-BLOCKING in `exfil.py` — searches that alternation, so a branch would turn every `?token=` URL into a blocked request rather than a masked log line. The pass ranks LAST: a value an earlier pass caught (an AKIA key, a JWT, a link token, a bare 40-char secret) keeps that pass's tag, warning and span byte-identically, and a value that is BYTE-IDENTICAL to one of the module's fixed credential tag literals (`CREDENTIAL_REDACTION_TAGS`) is skipped so re-redaction (the streaming path re-redacts the persisted copy; `redact_path_segments` requires a fixed point) cannot mangle `token=[REDACTED: credential]`. The skip trusts byte-identity, never a string shape: the value class admits `[`/`]`/`:`, so a prefix test would let an adversary-authored `?token=[REDACTED<secret>` bypass this terminal pass, and the exfil tag is deliberately NOT trusted either — its domain segment is attacker-satisfiable (`?token=[REDACTED: suspicious URL to <secret>.co]`), so a genuine exfil-tag value instead collapses once at its `[REDACTED:` head to already-redacted text and is a fixed point from the second application (pinned by the fixed-point, attacker-fake-tag, fake-exfil and registry-loop tests in `TestTokenParamValueRedaction`). Streaming: `_TOKEN_PARAM_PARTIAL_RE` joins the `cred_anchored` escalation in `StreamRedactor.feed` so a ≥512-char opaque token value is held to the 4096 ceiling (and fails closed past it) instead of being bisected at the DoS floor with its anchor-less tail streaming raw. Other credential-bearing parameter names (`access_token`, `id_token`, `api_key`, `code`) are deliberately excluded on the issue's scoping ground — each name wants its own false-positive analysis (`code=` collides with OAuth authorization codes and ordinary prose); a pass-4 name never feeds `_contains_fixed_credential`, so the blocking surface is not the reason. Pinned by `test_security.py::TestTokenParamValueRedaction` (opaque non-`eyJ` value, terminator set incl. RFC-excluded bytes, anchor near-miss controls, case-fold, template negatives, blocking-surface invariance, fixed point, pass-3 single-tag pin) and `TestStreamRedactor::test_terminal_long_opaque_token_param_not_bisected`
- **Token-parameter entity/drop invariants:** Named references stay case-sensitive inside the ASCII-folded name ladder (`&percnt;` decodes while `&PERCNT;` stays data), while numeric-reference `x` and hex digits retain their parser-defined case fold. When a complete token crossing forces a fail-closed drop but its value ends before the stream buffer, only the token region is dropped; the benign suffix stays buffered and continuation discard remains unarmed. The arming evidence must itself be STRONG (a `\Z`-anchored JWT or Bearer anchor, a token anchor whose `eq` group matched, or a complete crossing ending the buffer): a WEAK bare name prefix at the buffer end is held but never arms a discard, so every armed discard has exactly one kind. An armed discard consumes continuation only while bytes remain in the arming anchor's own value class (token-parameter, JWT, or Bearer), so each kind reaches its fixed point at its own terminator.
- Applied on **every** output path — each boundary where agent output reaches a human or an external service. The authoritative list is the `redaction_paths` control in `security_posture.py` (see "Security Posture Detail Registry" below), which is what Settings → Security renders; do NOT restate the count as a literal here (this line read "ALL 5 output paths" long after the real number had multiplied, and the dashboard's hardcoded pill inherited that stale 5)
- **Deny-surface tool titles** (`dashboard/chat_runner.py`): `event.title` prefers the model's own `description` field (`_select_tool_title`), so it is agent-controlled display text. Every permission-deny surface — the 🚫 blocked transcript row (broadcast AND persisted to the ConversationLog) and the SEL audit `tool_name` — renders it only through `_redact_display_text()` (both redactors, idempotent, byte-identical for clean titles). The two deny shapes are rendered in exactly one place each: `_reject_invalid_tool()` (name validation failed) and `_reject_hook_error()` (PreToolUse fire raised), beside `_reject_hook_blocked()` (hook exit-2 block), so a permission path added later cannot publish the raw title by omission. `test_dashboard_approval.py::TestDenyRowTitleRedaction` pins each path behaviorally plus a structural zero-raw-interpolation guard
- **Owner's credential-redaction switch** (`security/redaction_switch.py`, keystone `credential_redaction.json`, default ON, OWNER-VIEW scoped, PER-REQUEST): `redact_credentials()` stays unconditional on every surface EXCEPT inside an explicit `redaction_switch.owner_view()` scope, and only there does it consult the owner's switch -- with `enabled: false` it returns its input unchanged with no warnings. The scope is opened for exactly ONE surface, the file viewer, and only after the CALLER has verified, for that request, that the requester is the dashboard owner (`owner_view_for_request(request)`, a fail-closed wrapper over `is_owner_dashboard_request`; a Slack allow-listed non-owner running `!dashboard` authenticates with `app == ""` and `sub != owner_id` and gets the unconditional pass): the two `handlers/files.py` handlers that feed the viewer, `api_file_read` (the buffer) and `api_file_diff` (the `original` the buffer is compared against), both taking one verdict per request from `_owner_view_bypasses_credential_pass` -- one side raw and the other masked would render an unchanged credential line as a hunk -- and both going through `platform.context.redact_owner_view_via_context` so a loaded companion's exfil carve-outs and extra patterns still apply. That is the whole surface, and it is the one the motivating workflow needs -- ask the agent to write the value to a file, open the file in the Files view (the built-in Terminal already streams live output unredacted; the switch is for the rendered document view). `api_file_watch` is deliberately NOT a seam: the same SSE stream serves file-backed artifact live reload, and neither consumer renders its frame -- both re-read through `api_file_read`. Pinned as an allowlist by `test_only_the_named_owner_seams_open_the_scope` and per call site by `test_file_viewer_opens_the_scope_only_for_the_owner`: adding a seam is a review decision. What deliberately does NOT open the scope, and why: **the chat, in any form.** `chat_runner._flush_segment` redacts the assistant text BEFORE `slot.append`, so the transcript holds the redacted bytes and no display-time scope could restore them; a chat seam would advertise a raw transcript it cannot deliver (a raw-plus-redacted dual representation through finalization and persistence is the change that would make it real, and it is out of this PR's scope). The live SSE/WS wire streams (`_wsred` / `_thinkred`) and the broadcast display boundary fan ONE chunk to every connected client, owner or not, besides (pinned by `test_the_chat_surface_never_opens_the_scope`); Slack, Webex, Discord, Telegram and the shared messaging renderer redact at their own sinks and never import the scope (`test_channel_renderers_never_open_the_scope`); every ADMISSION predicate that decides whether a file may LEAVE the machine (`file_send`, `_gate_upload_file`, the outbox flagged-file check, all of which read `redact(text) != text`) is untouched (`test_file_admission_gates_use_the_unconditional_pass`); the persisted-history LOAD pass in `chat_persistence` stays unconditional because those bytes also feed the ACP prompt; the diagnostics bundle, the SEL and every log never open the scope. This keeps the `backend-security-controls` invariant ("scan before posting to Slack, the dashboard, or any external surface") intact: a scope a caller must OPEN, after an owner check, cannot be inherited by a sink that forgot to opt out. The switch governs the credential pass ONLY: `redact_exfiltration_urls` runs inside the scope too (the control against an injected agent carrying secrets out in a URL the dashboard renders and the browser fetches, with its own exemption seam in `CredentialPolicy.exempt_exact_hosts`), and every request-BLOCKING gate in `exfil.py` reads the pattern table through `_contains_fixed_credential` rather than the redaction pass. The scope is a `ContextVar`, not a global, so an owner-view render on one task cannot leak the bypass into a channel post the same gateway is making on another (`test_scope_does_not_leak_across_tasks`). The verdict is supplied by the seam and held in the `ContextVar` for the scope's lifetime (`owner_view()`, entered only when the seam has established both the owner requester and the disabled switch -- there is no `bypass` flag), so every redaction call inside one owner-view render sees the same verdict even if the owner flips the switch mid-render -- the flip is seen by the next request (`test_the_verdict_is_the_one_the_scope_was_entered_with`). Why it exists: the scrubber is shape-based and deliberately over-inclusive, so it also swallows values the owner legitimately needs to read back -- the `?token=` value of a one-time approval-workflow link (the pass-4 regression report that motivated it), a blob the owner generated on purpose -- and piping such a value to a file did not help because `api_file_read` runs the same pass. Stated limit: the switch reaches the CREDENTIAL pass only, so a URL the exfiltration-URL pass independently classifies as carrying data out (a long high-entropy query to a non-exempt host) is still replaced whole in the file viewer; whether a given approval link becomes readable depends on that classification and on a loaded companion's `exempt_exact_hosts`, not on this switch. Why the record is a keystone and not `config.json`: switching the scrubber off is an authorization, and the party it constrains is the agent, so a `config.json` switch would be flippable by a prompt-injected agent shell; the leaf sits on `security._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` (agent file tools refuse it), `sandbox._CREW_READONLY_LEAVES` (mounted read-only for the agent's shell) and `_CREW_PRECREATE_READONLY_FILE_LEAVES` (pre-created as `{}`, which reads as ON, so the absent-file default cannot be created from inside the namespace sandbox), with the same placement and reasoning as `file_delivery_consent.json`. Fail direction: every read that cannot positively establish `enabled: false` (absent, unreadable, malformed, non-UTF-8, non-boolean) answers ON. **Read cost, and the event loop:** there is no cache. The seam is a request handler that already does its file I/O off the loop, so it reads the keystone with `asyncio.to_thread(read_state)` once per owner request (the keystone is a fixed trusted path, not caller-supplied, so the default executor is the right one) and passes the verdict in; a verdict is never older than the request it serves and the loop never touches the filesystem for it. The ONLY writer is the owner-gated dashboard pair `GET`/`PUT /api/security/credential-redaction` (`dashboard/handlers/credential_redaction.py`; Settings -> Security -> Credential redaction in file views), which refuses a non-owner and an app token with 403 and SEL-audits every change as `credential_redaction.enabled` / `.disabled` every owner read as `.read` / `allowed` (non-critical: a read never fails on a briefly unavailable log), every switch change with the REAL subject as the caller (with no `owner_id` configured more than one local identity passes the owner check, and this row must say which one flipped it), and every refusal as `.denied` with the refused SUBJECT as the caller (never a constant, so repeated probing by one allow-listed non-owner is distinguishable); the audit record is written BEFORE the switch as a `critical=True` (synchronous, fail-loud) SEL write -- the default `sel.log` only enqueues and its writer swallows a failed append, so a queued record proves nothing -- and both run as ONE closure on the worker thread under the store's own re-entrant lock (`redaction_switch.transaction()`), so two interleaving PUTs cannot leave the latest SEL record contradicting the persisted switch; a successful PUT then pushes `credential_redaction_changed` to OWNER sockets only (`broadcast_ws_owners`, which bypasses the app-scope gate by construction, so no app token sees it) and every owner dashboard document drops its cached file bodies (`['file-read']`, `['file-diff']`, RESET rather than removed so a mounted observer such as the Library's `SessionDocPreview` sees `data: undefined` at once and refetches under the pass now in force, instead of keeping its last raw result rendered with nothing to re-render it) and its open clean tab bodies, not just the document that flipped the switch -- and, on a WebSocket reconnect (the push has no replay), re-reads the switch and purges if its position moved while the socket was down, or if the document had never read it and it is now ON and has been flipped before (`changed_at` set -- a file opened raw while OFF may be on screen; the shipped never-flipped default cannot have produced one), so a transient drop with nothing to catch never closes diff tabs or empties file bodies; a document the owner gate refuses asks once and then stops, so a non-owner's reconnects do not write audited refusals for a subject that took no action; and the card that made the change purges only on a write the server ACCEPTED, never on a refused one, because `asyncio.to_thread` cannot cancel a running thread and a handler cancelled mid-write (client gone, gateway stopping) must not leave the authorization changed without its trace; a DISABLE whose record cannot be written is refused with 503 and the switch stays ON, while an ENABLE (the fail-safe direction) proceeds regardless (`test_write_and_audit_are_one_unit_on_the_worker_thread`, `test_a_disable_whose_audit_cannot_be_written_does_not_happen`). Known limit, stated: the owner gate is an identity check, so an agent driving the owner's authenticated browser through computer use could flip it; what that buys is bounded to the owner's own dashboard file viewer, and the flip leaves an audit record.

- **Cross-chunk streaming redaction** (`StreamRedactor`): per-chunk redaction misses a credential split across a token/streaming/Slack chunk boundary (a chunk ending `...AKIA` and the next starting `IOSFODNN7...` each individually escape `redact_credentials()`, so raw fragments reach WebSocket/SSE/Slack consumers). `StreamRedactor` is a rolling-buffer redactor: it withholds the trailing run of credential-class characters (`_CRED_CLASS` — letters/digits + URL/base64/connection-string punctuation, the possible start of a not-yet-complete credential) until a non-credential-class terminator arrives or the stream ends, then rejoins and redacts before emitting on the wire. Holdback is bounded by `_STREAM_HOLDBACK_MAX = 512` (larger than the longest fixed-format credential) so a split token is always rejoined; `flush()` redacts the buffered remainder at segment/stream end. Adds at most one chunk of latency. **Streaming JWT/JWE ceiling** (round-2 + round-3): JWTs (esp. RS256/ES256 with embedded claims) routinely exceed 512 chars, so a terminal token longer than the DoS floor would otherwise be bisected — the first `len-512` chars emitted raw before `flush()` redacts only the held tail. When the withheld tail matches `_PARTIAL_JWT_TAIL_RE` (`eyJ…` optionally followed by up to FOUR `.`-separated base64url segments — `{0,4}`, so a 5-segment compact JWE escalates too, matching the batch JWE ceiling — anchored to buffer end) the cap is raised to `_STREAM_HOLDBACK_JWT_MAX = 4096` so the whole token is rejoined before emission; the 512-char floor still applies to every non-credential run. A trailing in-progress `?token=`/`&token=` parameter value (`_TOKEN_PARAM_PARTIAL_RE`, mirroring the batch pass-4 anchor incl. its case-folded name and value class) escalates the same way — without it a >=512-char opaque token value was bisected at the floor, committing the `token=` anchor into the redacted prefix while the anchor-less tail reached `flush()` and streamed raw. **Split-Bearer holdback** (a8e5fe6a): an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header spans whitespace (not in `_CRED_CLASS`), so the cred-class run alone would commit the `Authorization: Bearer ` prefix and leak the token on the next chunk. `_BEARER_ANCHOR_PARTIAL_RE` (case-insensitive, JSON-aware, `\Z`-anchored, matching any prefix of an in-progress `Authorization: Bearer <token>`) makes `feed` pull the commit index back to the anchor start (`i = min(i, anchor.start())`), holding header + token together, and escalates the cap so an opaque OAuth/refresh/SSO Bearer token >512 chars (no `eyJ`) is not bisected either. **Fail-closed ceiling** (round-3): when a credential-anchored tail (JWT/JWE/Bearer) exceeds the 4096 ceiling, `feed` FAILS CLOSED — it redacts+emits the confirmed-safe prefix, appends `_REDACTED_CREDENTIAL_TAG` (`[REDACTED: credential]`, shared with the batch redactor), and DROPS the oversized tail rather than bisecting it; a plain cred-class run with NO credential anchor is still committed verbatim (bisected — no data loss, DoS bound intact)
- **Streamed canonical-tag fixed point:** a chunk boundary after the interior space in a member of `CREDENTIAL_REDACTION_TAGS` used to let token-parameter pass 4 re-redact the `[REDACTED:` head and duplicate the remaining label. `StreamRedactor.feed()` now pulls its safety cut back when the buffer tail is a STRICT prefix of a module-owned canonical tag. The lookback is bounded by the longest registered tag; a complete tag commits normally; and the cut is applied after STRONG classification, so it never raises the DoS cap or authorizes a fail-closed drop. An incomplete prefix at `flush()` remains ordinary text.

### Supply-chain and CI-process controls

Three controls that gate a pull request rather than the runtime live with the rest
of the CI process, in [`../../ci/ci-and-reviews.md`](../../ci/ci-and-reviews.md):
the blocking production-npm vulnerability gate, the human-override path over the
AI-review lanes, and the pull-request readiness aggregate. The npm gate is a real
security control even though its mechanism is a workflow, so it is named here and
specified there — one account of one workflow, not two.

### Denied Commands (`security/` + `hooks.py`)

First-class `DeniedCommandRule` records in `BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES` (`security/`) — each a stable `id`, a Python regex `pattern`, a `category`, and a human `description` — blocking destructive and credential-exfiltrating operations. They are enforced **only** at Kiro Crew's own `hooks.py` PreToolUse gate (`HookManager.on_tool_call` → `PolicyAuthority.is_denied`), never by kiro-cli. They are no longer a raw `deniedCommands` array injected into a kiro agent JSON, so there is no `execute_bash`/`shell` tool-settings copy and no project-dir `agents/defaults.json` override for them. Built-ins are **default-ON but user-DISABLEABLE** from Settings → Security (see "Denied-command rules, opt-out state, and read-only auto-approve" below). Patterns for deployment-specific credential-vending CLIs are NOT in this catalog — a composed edition contributes those itself, either as an un-weakenable `SecurityOverlay` pattern or as a user-disableable rule through the `denied_rules` seam.

The two ACP transports' `approve_tool` methods run these security tiers once
more before any `allow` leaves the process. Approval consumers run the complete
identity-bearing gate first, including governance, while the transport repeats
only the identity-free security floor without counting it. See acp-client.md
§ Approval floor in `approve_tool`.

**Credential exfiltration blocks**:
- `.*echo.*\$AWS_SECRET.*`, `.*echo.*\$AWS_ACCESS.*`, `.*echo.*\$AWS_SESSION.*` — env var echo
- `credential-exfil-printenv-aws` — `printenv` (as a command word) naming a secret-bearing variable (`AWS_SECRET*` / `AWS_SESSION*` / `AWS_SECURITY*` / `AWS_ACCESS*`); `printenv AWS_REGION` is not a match. `credential-exfil-env-grep-aws` — an environment dump (`env` / `printenv` / `set` / `export -p` / `typeset` / `/proc/<pid>/environ`, as a command word) **piped** through `grep`/`awk`/`sed` selecting a name that can print a credential. The always-on keystone (`_ENV_CRED_SHARED_RULES`) reuses the identical regex (`_ENV_DUMP_GREP_AWS_PATTERN`) **on the same `_deny_matcher`**, so narrowing one tier never leaves the block standing on the other, and the tier with no length cap cannot be the slow one. Two boundaries define the narrowing, and both were chosen because an attacker cannot rewrite around them:
  - **The selector.** The bare `AWS`/`AWS_` prefix (which selects every AWS variable, secrets included), a secret-bearing word, or a **truncation** of one that ends the operand — `grep` matches by substring, so `env | grep AWS_S` prints `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`'s value exactly as `env | grep AWS_SECRET` does, and the truncations are derived from `_AWS_SECRET_WORDS` rather than listed. Requiring the operand to END at the truncation is what keeps `AWS_SDK_LOAD_CONFIG`, `AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE` and `AWS_STS_REGIONAL_ENDPOINTS` out. A named non-secret variable (`env | grep AWS_REGION`) and a digit-terminated prefix (`env | grep AWS1`, which no secret-bearing name contains) are not matches. `printenv` diverges here on purpose: it resolves EXACT names, so `printenv AWS_S` prints nothing and only whole words are denied.
  - **The command word.** The dump verb must both begin and end a word, so `unset`, `offset`, `pyenv`, `dotenv`, `src/environment` and `settings.py` are not dump verbs — but a `.` or `/` before it is deliberately allowed, because `/usr/bin/env`, `/bin/printenv` and `/proc/self/environ` are the same dumps under a path and are the most ordinary spelling of the command. `environ` and `typeset` are named in the verb list for that reason: a substring matcher caught them only by accident (`environ` contains `env`, `typeset` contains `set`), and `/proc/<pid>/environ` is the process environment while `typeset` with no operand prints every variable with its value, so bounding the verb without naming them would drop two real dumps. A quoted or substituted command word (`'env' | …`, `$(which env) | …`) is likewise still the dump, and the filter word is bounded the same way on its right rather than by requiring whitespace, so `env | 'grep' AWS_SECRET` is still a filter while `grepfoo` is not.

  The narrowing stops there. The gaps between the dump, the pipe, the filter and the selector are plain `.*` — **ordered existence within one line, with no statement or pipeline-stage scoping** — because a statement-scoped span has to treat `;` and `&` as separators and a regex cannot tell a separator from the identical character inside a quoted argument. `env | sed 's/;/x/' | grep AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, `env | grep -E 'a&b|AWS_SECRET'` and `env FOO='a;b' | grep AWS_SECRET` are ordinary credential dumps whose only unusual feature is a quoted separator, and a span that stops there fails **open** on all three. A `|` between the dump and the filter is still required, which is what keeps `env` as a wrapper (`env FOO=1 cmd`), `set -e; grep AWS_ file.txt` and `cat .env; grep AWS_ config.py` out.

  The residual **over-block** is what refusing to guess costs, and it is pinned by test (`RESIDUAL_OVER_BLOCK`): a later statement's filter is attributed to the dump (`env | head -5; grep -r AWS_ src/`, `env | wc -l && grep AWS_SECRET f`), a later pipeline stage's text is read as the filter's operand (`env | grep PATH | echo AWS_SECRET`), and `env` as another tool's subcommand counts as a dump (`conda env list | grep aws`). Anchoring the verb to a command position would reclaim the last one and would also drop `sudo -E /usr/bin/env | grep AWS_SECRET`, since any wrapper prefix defeats that anchor. Deliberately **out of scope**: a dump REDIRECTED to a file and read back with no pipe (`env > f; grep AWS_SECRET f`). Correlating the sink with the reader needs a backreference the RE2-style engine these built-ins are authored for does not have, and blocking only the `grep` spelling would be no control at all — `awk`, `sed` and a plain `cat` of the same file read it just as well and are equally unmatched. `redact_credentials` (AKIA/ASIA plus high-entropy detection) is what stands between that shape and a chat surface.
- `.*python.*boto3.*get_credentials.*`, `.*python.*botocore.*credentials.*` — script-based extraction
- `.*curl.*169\.254\.169\.254.*`, `.*wget.*169\.254\.169\.254.*` — IMDS metadata endpoint (coarse literal-string match)
  - **Encoding-aware IMDS gate** (`_check_imds_access` + `canonicalize_ip`): beyond the literal-string denies above, every IP-like token in a bash command is canonicalized to dotted-quad and compared to `169.254.169.254`, so alternate encodings the OS resolver/`curl` accept are blocked too — single-integer (`2852039166`), hex (`0xa9fea9fe`), octal per-octet, IPv6-mapped (`::ffff:169.254.169.254`), and the inet_aton **2-part (`169.16689662`) and 3-part (`169.254.43518`) short forms** (decimal or hex trailing component). The 2-/3-part forms are resolved via `socket.inet_aton` (the same resolver `curl` uses), which also rejects out-of-range forms (`169.254.11207422`) so benign hosts are not over-blocked.
- `.*curl.*\$AWS_SECRET.*`, `.*curl.*\$AWS_ACCESS.*` — credential exfil via curl
- `aws s3 cp .* s3://.*`, `aws s3 mv .* s3://.*`, `aws s3 sync .* s3://.*` — file upload exfiltration
- Direct credential-file path reads are intentionally absent from this catalog; file tools use `is_sensitive_path()` and subprocesses rely on the OS sandbox.

**Allowed operations** (not denied by this catalog):
- `ada credentials update` — NOT denied by this catalog. A composed edition may deny the credential-*vending* form through its own `SecurityOverlay`; where it does, the supported pattern is to run the vending command in your own terminal once and let `credential_process` in `~/.aws/config` refresh automatically for AWS CLI calls
- `ada profile add/list/print/delete` — NOT denied by this catalog either
- `aws sts assume-role` — cross-account access
- AWS CLI commands (`describe-*`, `list-*`, `get-*`, `filter-*`, `s3 cp`, `s3 ls`, etc.) — work via `credential_process`

**Destructive operation blocks**: `rm -rf`, protected or ambiguous `git push` targets (including force pushes to those targets), `aws * delete-*`, `aws ec2 terminate-instances`, `cdk destroy`, `terraform destroy`, etc. Force-pushing an explicit feature branch remains allowed.

**Self-protection global options**: the `restart`, `update`, `cloud` lifecycle, and `gateway restart` self-management commands are enforced by the argv-structural floor alone (`_matches_self_subcommand`), which reads the CLI's leading operand words after any interposed top-level options and handles shell quoting for both flags and subcommands. The regex rows that once sat beside these floors (`.*kiro.?crew(?:<flag-run>)*\s+restart.*` and siblings) were deleted, not narrowed: each opened with an unbounded any-run before the product name, so the name in a worktree path plus the verb word anywhere later matched (`ls ~/kirocrew-wt/restart.log`), and a row that fires on the product's name appearing anywhere adds nothing to a predicate that requires the product to be the argv's own program. The floor covers the repeatable verbosity spellings (`-v`, `-vv`, `--verbose`) and `--no-jail`; adding or quoting a valid global option or subcommand must not turn a denied self-management command into an allowed one. The one self-management subcommand row that KEEPS a regex is `self-protection-cron-adopt`: it has no floor twin, and the ownership grab it refuses is real.

**Command-ending newlines**: `_self_tokens` preserves unquoted newlines as
separators before `shlex` tokenization, using the shared `_iter_shell_chars`
quote/escape walk after folding line continuations. Otherwise `shlex` discards
the newline and makes the next command part of the preceding argv: an `awk`
formatting expression containing `$1` can then be misclassified as a dynamic
kill program targeting a later command's `$KIROCREW_SCRATCH` path. Quoted
newlines remain inside their operand, and escaped continuations still join the
command. Local assignments remain available across the preserved separators.
The existing deny catalog, nested-payload checks and real self-kill checks
continue to apply.

**Quote-normalized segment view (`_deny_segment_views` + `_shell_tokens`, `security/`)** — both deny tiers match TEXT, while a shell strips quoting, de-escapes backslashes, resolves ANSI-C / locale quoting, collapses empty-string splices and collapses whitespace runs before the program ever sees its argv. A rule authored as a command SHAPE was therefore defeated by re-spelling any single token: `rm -rf "/"`, `"rm" -rf /`, `rm "-rf" /`, `r''m -rf /`, `rm  -rf  /`, `rm -rf \/` and `rm -rf $'/'` all run exactly what `rm -rf /` runs, and none of them *contains* the rule's own text. Only the six self-protection rules and git-publish had an argv-structural floor closing this (above); the other ~130 built-ins — including every destructive-operation and credential-exfiltration rule listed in this section — were spelling-dependent. Pass 2 now evaluates each segment in **two views**: the raw text first (byte-identical to what it matched before), then a quote/escape-normalized re-join, appended **only when it differs**, so an unquoted command pays no second pass over the catalog. Four properties are load-bearing:

- **ANSI-C quoting is resolved as part of tokenization, on the RAW text; locale quoting is NOT the same thing.** `$'…'` is a quoting form whose value bash computes before the program sees it, so `rm -rf $'/'` and the hex-spelled flag `rm $'\x2d\x72\x66' /` both reach the `rm -rf /` rule, and a `$'…'`-wrapped nested payload is walked like any other. `_decode_shell_quoted_literals` replaces each `$'…'` span with `shlex.quote(_decode_ansi_c_body(body))`, so the decoded value stays ONE token even when it contains whitespace. Doing this BEFORE `shlex` is what makes it safe: `shlex` removes the quotes but leaves the `$` glued to the content, and at that point `$'/'` -> `$/` is indistinguishable from a variable reference such as `$HOME`, so a post-`shlex` `$`-strip would eat real variables and break the path normalizer's own `$HOME` expansion. Requiring the quote character means a bare `$HOME`, `${HOME}`, `$FOO` and `$(date)` are all untouched — pinned by `test_decoding_dollar_quotes_does_not_eat_variable_references`.
  - **`$"…"` is locale TRANSLATION and follows DOUBLE-QUOTE rules, which is measured, not assumed.** Treating it as ANSI-C was itself a bypass: bash gives `$"\r\mAA"` the word `\r\mAA`, byte-identical to plain `"\r\mAA"`, because inside double quotes a backslash escapes only `$`, a backtick, `"`, `\` and a newline — so `\r` is a literal backslash-r, not a carriage return. Decoding it as ANSI-C normalized that `\r` to whitespace and the command disappeared from the view, while the inner shell of `bash -c $"\r\m -rf /"` resolves the backslashes in its OWN lexing pass and runs the destructive command (measured: `bash -c $"\r\mAA"` executes `rmAA`). The `$` is therefore dropped and the double-quoted text left for `shlex`, which also keeps `rm -rf $"/"` reaching the rule since bash's operand there is `/`.
  - **Unicode escapes are decoded, at bash's EXACT widths, before the case fold — and that gap was not confined to this view.** `_decode_printf_escapes` handled octal and `\xHH` but not `\uHHHH` / `\UHHHHHHHH`, and the argv-structural self-protection floors already depended on it — so `kirocrew $'\u0074\u006f\u006b\u0065\u006e'` walked past the credential-mint rule while its `\x`-spelled twin was refused. Fixing the shared decoder closes both surfaces at once (`test_the_decoder_gap_also_bypassed_the_credential_mint_floor`). The widths are **exact and case-sensitive**: bash consumes at most 4 hex digits after `\u` and at most 8 after `\U`, so `$'\u0072f'` is `r` followed by a literal `f`, **not** a 5-digit code point. Reading more digits than the spelling allows is itself a bypass — the wrong character replaces the two the shell passes, and `rm -$'\u0072f' /` escaped the rule exactly that way. Because `is_denied` lowercases its input, and lowercasing destroys the `\u`/`\U` distinction, pass 2 splits its segments from the **original-case** text and `_deny_segment_views` decodes before folding case; the split is unaffected because no case mapping produces a separator (`test_case_is_preserved_until_after_the_escapes_are_decoded` pins both the commutation and that matching stays case-insensitive). A NUL **or a lone surrogate** is left encoded — the surrogate because it is not a character bash can pass either and a decoded one would reach the SEL record, whose JSON encoder raises on it, turning a denial into a crash.
  - **Residual on the floor path.** The self-protection floors take an already-lowercased string by contract (`_is_credential_mint(text_lower)` and siblings), so on that path a `\U`-spelled escape still arrives as `\u` and its 8-digit form is not decoded. That is strictly narrower than before — every `\u`/`\U` spelling was missed there previously, and the 4-digit `\u` form is now caught — but closing it fully means threading original case through the floor's whole signature surface, which is a separate change. (The one predicate that now takes the original text is `_is_credential_mint(text_lower, *, raw_text=)`, for decoding base64 literals — a case-sensitive encoding the lower-cased view destroys; it does not re-read the `\U` escapes.)
- **Additive, never a replacement.** The raw view is matched first and independently, for the same reason the self-protection floor keeps its regex: a payload the tokenizer cannot see into (`bash -c "…"`, `eval "$CMD"`) is still caught on raw text. A normalization failure can lose the EXTRA match but never the raw one, so it cannot turn a denied command into an allowed one. `_shell_tokens` additionally degrades to whitespace splitting with quote stripping when `shlex` rejects the input, so an unterminated quote (`rm -rf "/`) still normalizes rather than yielding no view at all.
- **Per SEGMENT, never per command.** Re-joining tokens with single spaces erases the separators that END a command, so a whole-input re-join would FABRICATE a command that was never run — `echo rm` + newline + `-rf /` is two commands and reads as `echo rm -rf /`. Views are built from `_split_segments` output so no boundary is ever crossed, **including inside a nested payload**, which is split the same way before being viewed; the heredoc frames pinned by `TestStdinProgramTextScoping::test_benign_neighbour_no_longer_reads_as_a_mint` are the concrete case this protects, and `TestDenyMatchingIsQuoteNormalized::test_the_view_never_crosses_a_separator` pins the property directly.
- **Nested shell payloads are viewed in their own right.** A shell's `-c` argument is a *command*, and `shlex` strips only the OUTER quoting level — so `bash -c 'dd "if=/dev/zero" of=/dev/sda'` re-joins with its inner quotes intact and the `dd if=` rule still misses it, while the unquoted inner spelling (`bash -c 'rm -rf /'`) was already caught on raw text. Each literal payload is therefore walked and viewed, reusing `_nested_shell_payloads` — the same extractor the self-protection floor uses, so the `-c` / `eval` / `env -S` / herestring / `$SHELL -c` spellings and the `bash -c -- <script>` form are recognized by construction rather than re-enumerated. The walk takes **no numeric depth cap**, for the reason `_self_token_frames` records (whatever the number, one more wrapper defeats it); it terminates structurally, because a payload is carried inside ONE token of its parent and is therefore strictly shorter than the parent's source text. Only LITERAL payloads exist to walk — `eval "$CMD"` carries no visible script and stays the raw tier's job. Found by the GPT 5.6 review lane on the PR that added this view.
  - **The GLUED `-c` spelling is a separate, independent scan (#8197).** `-c` takes a value, so a getopt-convention shell (`ksh`, `zsh`) ends option parsing at the `c` and runs everything glued after it — and the reading is deliberately over-approximated for shells whose parsers keep consuming cluster letters (bash, dash), because extraction must cover the strictest interpreter the command could reach. `sh -c'rg . <fenced-root>'` reaches the walk as ONE token (`-crg . <fenced-root>`) once `shlex` strips the quotes. `_SHELL_COMMAND_FLAG_RE` anchors the whole token as a bare flag cluster, so a token carrying the payload's own characters was rejected and the payload never yielded — unexamined by every consumer of the extractor, the self-protection floor included. The companion pattern `_SHELL_COMMAND_GLUED_RE` captures the glued remainder (non-greedy, splitting at the FIRST lowercase `c`, flag letters of either case before it) instead of weakening the flag pattern where it is used for pure flag detection — and the flag pattern itself deliberately stays lowercase-only, because widening it made an uppercase-clustered decoy (`-Cc`) the first flag stop and ate the stop through which a following `--command`'s payload was found (both directions found by review lanes on this change). The command flag, the herestring, and the glued spelling each get their OWN precomputed stop table (a shared table let whichever spelling came first EAT the stop through which a later spelling's payload was found), and an **every-carrier sweep** closes the within-class half for short-cluster `-c` carriers: one forward pass from the first shell token appends the payload of EVERY such carrier under the LOOSE recognition the deleted local extractor used (`_shell_c_carrier_glued`: any prefix before the first lowercase `c`, so `-1c…`, `-Cc` and a decoy like `-onoclobber` cannot eat a later carrier's stop), deduplicated against what the tables already yielded so exact-payload-list consumers are unchanged, keeping the function O(N) — each token's glued payload is extracted ONCE up front, because many shell tokens sharing one stop index would otherwise each copy the same substring (O(N·M), found by the GPT 5.6 lane). **The glued split is fold-ambiguity safe** (`_shell_c_carrier_payloads`): the deny tiers lowercase input before the walk, so `-Cc'<script>'` (a real zsh/ksh spelling) folds to `-cc<script>` and a first-`c`-only split misread the payload as `c<script>`, hiding a protected push behind one junk letter (GPT 5.6 CI lane; the folded spelling can also be written directly). Which `c` took the argument is unrecoverable after the fold, so every plausible split is yielded: the first `c`, plus each consecutive-`c` run's last and second-to-last split (covering payloads whose program starts with one `c`, like `cat`/`curl`). Split positions are bounded to the last `_CARRIER_SPLIT_WINDOW` (64) characters of the leading letter region — linear without a padding bypass, because the true split's distance to the region's end is the payload's first-word length (a real program name), while padding only adds fake splits farther out whose program words are flag-letter runs matching no rule; without the bound a ~3 KB alternating-`c` token made the candidate set quadratic and the synchronous deny scan outlived the loop watchdog (GPT 5.6 CI lane). Stated residuals: `--command` carriers stay first-stop-only (the sweep's loose recognition is scoped to short clusters; no supported shell has a `--command` option, so this is a lost over-approximation, not a bypass — and in the DENY tiers, which lowercase input first, `-Cc` folds to `-cc` and eats the `--command` stop exactly as it always has, a pre-existing residual the case-preserving protection cannot reach); herestrings keep a first-occurrence residual (`bash <<<'a' <<<'b'` yields `a`; a real shell applies the last redirect); and the sweep's carrier recognition is segment-wide rather than command-wide, so a `-c`-carrying token of a LATER pipeline stage (`sh -c 'cat log' | grep -c <pattern>`) yields a junk payload — accepted, since a junk payload re-tokenizes to text no rule routes, and over-approximation is this module's documented safe direction. A glued payload is SYNTHESIZED text (a substring, not a token), so per the synthesized-payload rule above the data-consumer exemption fails closed on it: `echo bash -c'rm -rf /'`, a pure print, is descended into and denied — the same accepted over-block direction as the herestring tail and the glued `env -S` argument. An all-alpha cluster (`-ecfoo`) is genuinely ambiguous post-tokenization — it satisfies the bare-flag reading (next token is the script) AND carries a remainder a getopt-convention shell would run — so BOTH readings are yielded. The alt-traversal pass's local copy of this handling (`_alt_shell_c_payloads`, added by the PR for #7309 when changing the shared extractor was out of its scope) is deleted with this: extraction is the shared extractor's alone (re-run ONCE on an assignment-substituted token list when a resolved program name is a shell the shared walk could not see literally), and the alt pass keeps only what the shared extractor cannot know — assignment-resolved program names and positional-parameter binding (`_alt_bound_shell_payloads`, which locates the command string through the same loose carrier recognition so the two cannot drift).
  - **A payload carried by a data consumer is not descended into.** `echo bash -c '<script>'` prints the script, so walking it would refuse a command that runs nothing. `_data_consumer_exempt` decides this — the same guarded exemption the self-protection floor uses, so a piped evaluator (`echo … | sh`), a substitution in program position, and an `awk`/`sed` script carrying an executing construct all withdraw the exemption. This is deliberately **not** implemented as "descend only when the launcher is in command position", the narrowing suggested alongside the advisory: the launcher is *not* in command position in `sudo bash -c …`, `timeout 5 bash -c …`, `nohup …`, `ssh host …`, `xargs …` or `env FOO=1 bash -c …`, all of which execute the payload, so a position rule trades one false positive for six bypasses (`TestDenyMatchingIsQuoteNormalized::test_executor_wrappers_are_still_walked` pins all six). Because the exemption governs only whether to DESCEND, the raw tier is untouched: the unquoted mention `echo rm -rf /` stays refused exactly as it was before this view existed.
  - **The exemption is decided per OCCURRENCE and fails closed, because a payload is not necessarily a token.** `_nested_shell_payloads` also returns SYNTHESIZED text — a `sed` `e`-flag replacement, the tail of a glued herestring (`bash<<<'<script>'`), a glued `env -S` argument, an `alias` assignment — which is a substring or a re-join rather than an element of the token list. Recovering a position with `list.index` therefore raised `ValueError` and propagated **out of the permission gate on legitimate input** (`sed 's/x/y/e' notes.txt`), which is a crash where a security decision belongs; the GPT 5.6 and Opus 4.8 lanes found it independently. The exemption is now applied only when the payload appears as a token AND *every* occurrence sits in the argv of a data consumer; a payload with no token position cannot be proven inert and is descended into. Deciding from a single recovered index would not be sound — a short synthesized payload can also be a coincidental substring of an unrelated token, and one wrong position could wrongly exempt a payload that really executes. Every window is additionally built inside a guard, so `_deny_segment_views` cannot raise at all: a failure drops that window and leaves the raw view standing (`test_view_construction_never_raises`).
- **No expansion — which is why `_shell_tokens` was factored OUT of `normalize_shell_command` rather than reused whole.** The view stops before `~`/`$HOME` for two reasons. Expansion is platform-dependent: it DELETES the literal `~` that `rm -rf ~.*` is authored to match, and on Windows yields a drive path (`c:\users\…`) that no POSIX-anchored rule matches — so `rm -rf "~"` would be caught on Linux by the sibling `rm -rf /.*` rule and missed on Windows. And a denied view becomes the security event log's `operation` field, so expanding here would write the operator's real home path into the audit trail on every such denial. Path IDENTITY (dot segments, `..`, `$HOME` versus the resolved home) stays with `_check_sensitive_via_normalizer` over the sensitive-path keystone — the layer that RESOLVES rather than matches. Both functions share one tokenizer, so token identity cannot drift between the argv view and the path view.
- **An empty-elided render is ADDED as a third view, never substituted for the plain join (issue #7500).** An empty-quoted word — `""`, `''`, `$''`, `$""`, or any concatenation of them (`""''`, `""""`) — is a real argv element that the shell does hand to the program, so `_shell_tokens` is correct to keep it and the payload walk still reads argv as written. What it cannot survive is the RENDER: a single-space join turns a zero-width element into a spurious extra separator, so `rm -rf "" /home/x` rendered as `rm -rf  /home/x` and the `rm -rf /.*` rule stopped matching its own target — the destructive command ran exactly as written and only the gate was fooled. The escape was pattern-DEPENDENT, not systematic: `chmod "" 777 /etc/passwd` stayed denied because the rule that catches it (`chmod.*/etc/.*`) tolerates the extra separator, which is why the repair belongs in the render and not in individual rules. **Both whitespace shapes are emitted**, because REPLACING the plain join loses denials that existed: a rule that REQUIRES an intervening token (`rm -rf .* ./data`) matched the double-spaced view and matches neither the elided one nor the command's canonical spelling, so `r""m -rf "" ./data` was refused before and became allowed — the additive-only property this helper documents is load-bearing, not tidiness (found by the GPT 5.6 lane, reproduced against the merge-base; pinned by `test_the_elided_view_is_added_and_never_substituted`). The fix is in the RECOGNIZER: `_shell_tokens`' documented contract — argv as a POSIX shell hands it over — is unchanged, so the path normalizer's ~19 consumers see identical tokens. The six self-protection rules were never fooled, because their argv-structural floor does not match a rendered line. Pinned by `TestEmptyArgvElementDoesNotBreakTheDenyView`.
  - **The git-publish floor's DETECTOR gap is closed for QUOTED empty words (issue #8115).** `git "" push origin main` was allowed: every git-publish rule is stripped from the regex tier and enforced solely by `_git_publish_floor_tags`, whose entry detector `_is_git_publish` reads the RAW command text in pass 1 and requires the program and the subcommand adjacent, while its normalizer second pass (`_is_git_push_via_normalizer`) broke its subcommand-seek loop on the interposed empty argv element — so the floor was never consulted at all. The normalizer pass now reads past words git cannot resolve a command name from — empty and whitespace-only tokens — while seeking the subcommand (no matching guard is needed in program position: a zero-width word never resolved to the program word, so the outer scan already steps past it). The widening is DETECTION-only and deliberately fail-closed OVER-detection: git does not ignore a zero-width word — it takes it as its command name and exits — so a spelling this newly reaches either fails to run a push at all or was already reached in its adjacent spelling; no runnable push gains an escape. What fires for the newly-reached spellings is the UNGATED anti-obfuscation branch, not the protected-branch rule: `_git_push_args` anchors on the raw split and does not skip the empty word, so the parse fails and the floor denies unconditionally (`_GIT_PUBLISH_UNGATED`) — the right treatment for a spelling git itself cannot run, and a mention-shaped spelling such as `echo git " " push origin main` inherits exactly the treatment its adjacent twin already had. `str.strip()`'s whitespace set is wider than POSIX IFS, deliberately: every extra skippable character is still a word git rejects as a command name, so the breadth only ever adds detection. The subcommand-position requirement is intact — `git "" stash push` stays a non-publish. **Residual: an UNQUOTED expansion that evaporates is a different shape and is NOT closed here.** `git $(echo '') push origin main` or `git ${UNSET} push origin main` hands the detector a non-empty token (`$(echo`, `${unset}`) that is neither a flag nor `push`, and the shell REMOVES the word entirely at run time — so git really pushes; the zero-width-word justification does not apply because no zero-width word survives to argv. Closing it needs the normalizer to model expansion — the same boundary the glue-evasion residual above records — tracked by issue #8459. Pinned by `TestEmptyArgvElementDoesNotBreakTheDenyView::test_the_git_publish_detector_skips_an_empty_word` (the flipped form of the pin #8114 left).
- **Residual.** A token split by BOTH quoting and a separator-shaped glue construct (`"rm"$(echo ' ')-rf /`) is in none of the views: the raw text is not contiguous and the glue lands on its own segment. The whole-string raw pass covers the glue-ONLY spelling (`git$(echo ' ')push`); closing the combination needs a normalizer that models substitution, which a re-join is not. A variable spelling of an operand (`rm -rf $HOME`) is likewise outside this view, by the design point above. And a quoted WHITESPACE-ONLY word (`rm -rf " " /home/x`, `rm -rf $'\t' /home/x`) still renders an extra separator and still escapes a command-shape rule. A render that dropped it would be additive like the empty-elided one and so could not lose a denial, but it is not the same claim: an empty element carries no characters, so a view without it is still the argv the shell hands over, while a whitespace-only element is a real operand naming a file that can exist, so a view without it is an argv **one operand short** of the one that runs — and `is_denied`'s exception machinery is matched against views (present; `_DENY_EXCEPTIONS` empty today), so the direction that widening opens is ALLOW. The naive alternative is unsound and must not be chosen either: whitespace-collapsing the joined line would merge a two-word filename (`rm -rf "a b"`) into two operands and match a rule against a command that was never run. Recognizing that shape wants rules matched against argv STRUCTURE rather than against a rendered line, which is what `_SELF_PROTECTION_FLOOR_PATTERNS` already does for the six self-protection rules (and what the git-publish floor now does for its own whitespace-only shape — `git " " push origin main` denies argv-structurally since issue #8115, without touching this rendered-line residual) — tracked by issue #8124. Pinned by `TestEmptyArgvElementDoesNotBreakTheDenyView::test_a_whitespace_only_word_is_a_documented_residual`, whose assertion flips when it is closed.
- **Line continuations are folded before the segment split, quote-aware (`_fold_line_continuations`).** A shell removes `backslash + newline` while lexing, so `"r\<nl>m" -rf /` runs `rm -rf /` — and `_split_segments` cuts on that newline, severing the continuation before any view is built, so every command-shape rule missed the spelling (pre-existing: the raw text does not contain the rule's own text either). The fold therefore runs on the input **before** the split; pass 1 still matches the completely unfolded text, so this only adds reach. Which contexts fold was **measured against bash** (`printf %q` on the resulting argv for `<spelling> BB`), not assumed:

  | spelling | bash argv | folded? |
  |---|---|---|
  | `A\<nl>A BB` | `<AA><BB>` | yes |
  | `"A\<nl>A" BB` | `<AA><BB>` | yes |
  | `'A\<nl>A' BB` | `<A\<nl>A><BB>` | no |
  | `$'A\<nl>A' BB` | `<A\<nl>A><BB>` | no |

  So the scan folds unquoted and inside double quotes and preserves single-quoted and ANSI-C spans; `$"…"` follows the double-quote rule because only `$'` opens a preserving span. It runs BEFORE the ANSI-C decode, which is the shell's own order — continuations go while lexing, the escape body is interpreted after — so a preserved `\<nl>` inside `$'…'` stays part of that literal. **The pre-existing `_shell_join_continuations` was deliberately NOT reused**: it is a bare regex that folds inside single quotes too, and its own comment scopes it to the self-protection floor's tokenizer input rather than to the matched text of the whole catalog, so reusing it would fold `echo 'r\<nl>m -rf /'` — which bash prints literally — into a denial. `test_the_blunt_floor_helper_is_why_the_fold_is_quote_aware` keeps that rejected reuse on the record.
  - **A nested payload gets the same pre-lex treatment, and the WHOLE command is walked for payloads.** The shell that runs a `-c` script folds *its* continuations before lexing it, so the payload is folded before being split; and because `_split_segments` is deliberately quote-unaware, a newline inside the quoted payload severs the command before the script can be extracted at all — `bash -c 'r\<nl>m -rf /'` arrives as the pieces `bash -c 'r\` and `m -rf /'`. The whole command is therefore also walked for payloads, with `emit_self=False` suppressing its own re-join, which is what keeps that walk from fabricating a command across its separators.
  - **The ANSI-C body decoder is a SINGLE left-to-right pass (`_decode_ansi_c_body`).** Bash resolves `\"` and `\'` inside `$'…'`, so `bash -c $'rm -rf \"/\"'` hands the inner shell the script `rm -rf "/"`; leaving the backslashes in made the nested view miss the rule. Sequential `str.replace` calls cannot do this safely: `$'\\n'` is an escaped backslash followed by the letter `n` — two characters — but resolving `\\` first and then looking for `\n` collapses it to whitespace and invents a separator bash never passed. Each escape is consumed atomically instead. Literal escapes (`\\ \' \" \?`) decode to their character, the control family (`\a \b \e \E \f \n \r \t \v`) keeps this file's long-standing normalization to a SPACE (the value here is that a token boundary appears where the shell puts one, and a literal control byte in a matched view would only travel into the audit record), numeric forms keep bash's exact widths — **octal is masked to ONE BYTE**, which is bash's semantics and was measured (`$'\555'` is `m`, `$'\777'` is 0xFF); converting the full value gave `$'r\555'` the character `ŭ` where bash passes `rm`, so that spelling ran while the view matched nothing. **A NUL TRUNCATES the body**, which is also measured and also was a bypass: bash cannot place a NUL in an argv and what it does instead is stop there, so `$'AA\0junk'`, `$'AA\400junk'`, `$'AA\x00junk'`, `$'AA\u0000j'` and `$'AA\c@junk'` all yield `AA` — leaving the escape encoded let `$'dd\0junk' if=/dev/zero of=/dev/sda` run while the view held `dd\0junk if=`. The other inert codes (out of range, lone surrogate) keep the escape rather than truncating, because bash does not produce them at all. An unrecognised escape keeps both characters as bash does. **`\cX` control escapes decode too, on a MEASURED mapping**: `ord(upper(X)) & 0x1F` with `?` special-cased to 0x7F — an XOR-0x40 derivation gets `\c0` wrong (bash yields 0x10, not `p`). `\cI` is a TAB, so `bash -c $'rm\cI-rf /'` hands the inner shell a tab-separated `rm -rf /` and it runs; every `\cX` result is a control character and so takes the same normalization to a space, except a NUL, which stays encoded. The mapping is restricted to a **single ASCII** target, because `str.upper()` is not length-preserving outside it (`"ß".upper()` is `"SS"`) and `ord` of that raised `TypeError` straight out of the permission gate — a crash where a security decision belongs; a non-ASCII target keeps both characters instead.
- **The quoting regex excludes the backslash from its negated classes, and that is a ReDoS fix.** With `[^']` a backslash could match either alternative — `\\.` (two characters) or the class (one) — the textbook ambiguous quoted-string pattern, so an unterminated `$'` followed by a run of backslashes forces the engine through ~1.618ⁿ tilings of that run. This regex runs inside the PreToolUse gate on the full, uncapped command, so it is a hang rather than a slowdown (measured: 9 ms at 24 backslashes, growing ~1.6x per character). Excluding the backslash makes the alternation unambiguous — a backslash is always consumed by `\\.` — while accepting exactly the same language. Pinned structurally *and* with a time budget by `test_the_quoting_regex_is_not_redos_prone`.
- **Audit metadata goes through `redact_and_truncate`, never a bare slice.** A credential straddling the 200-character boundary would be cut in half, and the fragment no longer matches the credential pattern, so SEL's own write-path redaction cannot catch it and the partial secret persists in a dashboard-readable log — the exact reason that helper exists ("Redaction runs over the full text BEFORE the `max_chars` slice"). `_emit_deny_event`'s `segment` and `raw_segment` take it, and so do the other two emitters that carry caller text into metadata: `_emit_push_allow_event`'s `command` and `audit_injection_dropped`'s `sample`. The same rule holds outside this module for any caller text bound for a durable SEL field: `aws_consent.audit_decision` and its twin `file_delivery_consent.audit_decision` route `detail` through `redact_log_via_context(detail)[:200]` — the gate-side spelling, so a loaded companion's patterns apply and the line never raises — before it is joined into the `resources` string handed to `log_api_access`; the slice follows the redaction, never precedes it. The `if detail else <prefix>` branch is kept so an empty `detail` still emits the bare `service` / `destination_class` with no `": "` separator. Pinned by `TestAuditDecisionRedactsBeforeTruncate` in `test_aws_consent.py` and `test_file_delivery_consent.py`.
  - **The ORDER only buys anything if the caller has not already folded the text.** The scrubber's AWS key-ID spelling is case-SENSITIVE on purpose — widening it would false-positive on ordinary prose (`asia` is a word) across every egress surface, and `credential_patterns.AWS_KEY_ID` also gates a request-blocking surface — so a key handed over already lowercased slips past the pre-slice pass, gets cut by the 200-char clip, and the surviving prefix is then too short for SEL's own any-case write-path net (`sel._AWS_KEY_ANYCASE_RE`, boundary-bounded at both ends) to match either. `is_denied` therefore audits the RAW `tool_name` on the allow path, not the `lower` view it matched with; the injection-dropped emitter's three callers already pass raw text: one in `context.py` (`thread_meta`) and two in `context_assembly/turn.py` (`thread_context_parts`, `rail_parts`). An INTACT case-folded key is still caught, by that write-path net — the straddling window is the only one where both passes miss.
- **The whole-command payload walk is skipped when the split produced a single segment**, because the whole command then IS that segment and walking it twice doubles the payload scan for no additional view. That scan is quadratic in token count inside the pre-existing `_nested_shell_payloads`, which the self-protection floor already runs on every command (measured on a command padded with N interpreter tokens: the extractor alone is ~280 ms at N=1600, the floor's own `_self_token_frames` ~287 ms, and this pass went from ~2.07 s to ~1.02 s once the duplicate was removed). **Residual:** the remaining factor over the floor is the same quadratic, paid once more here; making `_nested_shell_payloads` linear is a change to shared floor machinery with its own review surface, not a normalization change. Pinned by `TestDenyMatchingIsQuoteNormalized::test_a_single_segment_command_is_not_walked_twice`.
- **Accepted residuals — two false positives, kept on purpose.** Both were raised as advisories and both are over-blocks rather than bypasses. (a) `$'…'` is inert inside DOUBLE quotes — bash's word for `"$'r\155 -rf /'"` is the literal text and `echo` prints it verbatim — but the decode does not track the outer quote context, so a view can hold the decoded form. (b) `$'r\155 -rf /'` is ONE word whose intra-word spaces become argv boundaries in the re-join; running it yields "No such file or directory", since no program has that name. Both are accepted on the asymmetry this module already documents for its data-consumer denylist: a false positive is "annoying, visible, and safe" whereas the inverse is a silent bypass, and `is_denied`'s own docstring states over-blocking is the safer direction for this pass. Both suggested remedies push toward *less* denial, and the second would have to mask intra-token whitespace — the mechanism that makes a re-spelled command's argv read as the command at all. Pinned by `TestDenyMatchingIsQuoteNormalized::test_two_accepted_over_blocks_are_pinned_not_implied`.
- **Residual — a rule's own text must still be contiguous, which no view can fix.** `$'rm\0junk' -rf --no-preserve-root /` normalizes to exactly the command bash runs, and is still allowed, because `rm -rf /.*` requires its text contiguous and does not tolerate an interposed flag. The PLAIN spelling `rm -rf --no-preserve-root /` is allowed for the same reason, which is what places this in the built-in rule's authoring rather than in normalization: no view can make a non-matching pattern match. Closing it means editing a shipped rule's regex, which changes matching for the whole catalog. Pinned by `TestDenyMatchingIsQuoteNormalized::test_flag_interposition_is_a_catalog_gap_not_a_view_gap`, whose first assertion flips when it is closed.
- **Residual — the synthesized-target tier is NOT covered, and not for the reason first claimed.** `is_denied_synthesized_target` matches raw text only. The PR that added this view justified that by calling the target gate-constructed rather than shell text; pinning the assumption disproved it. The `path` VALUE is model-authored, and `_normalize_search_path` resolves home variables and dot segments but **not quoting**, so `path='"$HOME"/notes'` synthesizes `file-search path="/home/alice"/notes max_depth=3` — quote characters intact — and a path-keyed operator rule can miss it exactly as the shell tiers used to. What IS true is that the tier has different semantics (a synthesized grammar with no chaining, no program position, and values whitespace-encoded by the synthesizer), so the per-segment shell view is the wrong instrument for it; the fix belongs in `_normalize_search_path`, alongside the normalization it already performs. Pinned as a documented gap by `TestDenyMatchingIsQuoteNormalized::test_the_synthesized_target_keeps_model_authored_quoting`, which is the assertion that must flip when it is closed.

**Structured-param synthesis (`_command_from_tool_params`, `types.py`)** — kiro-cli's `use_aws` tool is reported with `kind=execute` (making `is_shell=True`) but its params are the structured `{service_name, operation_name, parameters, region}` shape, not the `{command: "..."}` shape. Without synthesis, `AcpEvent.shell_command` returns None and the deny-by-default backstop fires on every `use_aws` call. The helper synthesizes `aws <service> <operation> [--region r] <serialized parameters> <positional args>` for the gate to evaluate:

- **Casing normalization**: `operation_name` is normalized PascalCase/camelCase → kebab-case via `_normalize_to_kebab()` before synthesis (e.g. `DeleteStack` → `delete-stack`). This prevents a casing mismatch from silently bypassing the kebab-case deny globs. `service_name` is NOT normalized because AWS CLI service names are already single lowercase tokens (`cloudformation`, `s3api`) and normalizing them would incorrectly hyphenate. The normalization is injective over the space of valid AWS API names so it cannot produce false collisions between a benign op and a denied one.
- **Whitespace fail-closed**: `service_name` or `operation_name` containing whitespace returns None (deny-by-default) rather than synthesizing a multi-token string that could confuse regex-based deny rules or produce shell-injection semantics in the synthesized string.
- **Best-effort caveat (serialized tail)**: the `parameters` dict is serialized via `json.dumps(sort_keys=True)` into the synthesized command tail so command-oriented deny and exfiltration checks can inspect it. The path gate does not treat that JSON string as a resolved file target, and JSON escaping (`\"`, `\\`) can render an embedded payload in a form the shell-text matchers were not authored for. This is acceptable for a single-user tool with operator consent (the human sees the tool call in the approval UI) but is NOT a complete smuggling defense. A future hardening pass could apply the relevant checks to deserialized leaf values individually.
- **Half-formed shape fallback**: if either `service_name` or `operation_name` is missing/empty/non-string, synthesis returns None and deny-by-default remains armed.
- **Evidence note**: no captured event in the security event log contains the raw `operation_name` value (the SEL records tool names, not params). The kiro-cli binary strings contain PascalCase AWS SDK operation names (`GetId`, `CreateToken`, `DeleteStack`), and the tool spec states params "MUST conform to the AWS CLI specification" (kebab-case), but since the value is model-authored, BOTH casings can arrive. Normalization makes the assumption non-load-bearing.

**File-search argument synthesis (`_search_deny_target`, `hook_runtime/search_targets.py`)** — both deny tiers match text, and they are handed the display title plus, for a shell tool, the raw `command`. A file-search builtin (`glob`, `grep`, the `code` tool's search operations) has neither: its title is LLM-authored prose that need not name a path, and it carries no `command`. Its scope — the root it walks and whether that walk is depth-capped — lives only in its arguments, so a `glob` rooted at the home directory reads the same tree a `find ~` does while the `find` rules authored to refuse exactly that see nothing. The gate therefore synthesizes a fourth deny target, `file-search path=… max_depth=…`, from `raw_params` and evaluates it in a **tier of its own** (`is_denied_synthesized_target`), not alongside `normalized` / `tool_name` / `command`.

- **Only SCOPE is emitted — `pattern` and `include` deliberately are not.** They are model-authored free text, and emitting them verbatim broke the mechanism in both directions: a value could mint a field it is not (a pattern containing `max_depth=` silences a rule keyed on the absence of a cap — the absence of a key is the only way the tier can express "unbounded"), and a read-only search whose pattern is `DROP TABLE` matched the command-oriented `sql-drop-table` built-in, denying ordinary audit greps. `pattern` is read by the shape gate only. The consequence to know: a rule can constrain *where* a search runs, never *what* it looks for.
- **Every emitted value is percent-encoded** (`_encode_search_field`) for `=`, whitespace and `%`, so a value cannot forge a field boundary or a field name. Without this an attacker-controlled or merely unlucky `path` disarms the rule.
- **Shape-identified, not title-identified**: a non-empty `pattern`, or an `operation` in the enumerated `_RECURSIVE_SEARCH_OPERATIONS` set (walks that carry no pattern of their own), and no `command`. The arguments are what the tool actually runs with — the same ground-truth reasoning the sensitive-path keystone uses when it reads `raw_params['path']`. A `command` means a shell tool, already covered by the raw-command target.
- **An absent `max_depth` emits nothing**, which is what lets a rule express "an unbounded search", mirroring how the built-in `find` rules distinguish a capped traversal from a whole-tree walk. A `max_depth=0` IS emitted (an explicit cap, not a missing one); a boolean depth is not (`bool` is an `int` subclass and no rule could match it sensibly).
- **Both key spellings are read, one is emitted.** Our tool schemas declare snake_case but kiro-cli echoes some `rawInput` keys camelCased (the split `TOOL_PURPOSE_KEYS` handles for the purpose key), so each field is looked up under every accepted spelling — `max_depth`/`maxDepth`, `path`/`file_path`/`filePath` — and written under the canonical snake_case name, so a rule spells each field exactly once. A missed spelling would not merely drop a field, it would **invert** a rule: without `max_depth`, an absence-of-a-cap rule fires on a search that carries a cap.
- **The `file-search` prefix is a namespace, not a trust boundary.** The display title is a deny target in its own right, so a title quoting the prefix trips such a rule too. That is an over-block identical to the title tier for every other rule and it grants nothing.
- **The `path` field is normalized before encoding** (`_normalize_search_path`: home-variable substitution → `expanduser` → `normpath`, rewrite separators to `/`, then collapse a leading `//` to `/` on POSIX), so one spelling of a tree reaches a rule. `path="~"` walks the home tree exactly as its literal root does, and a rule anchored on the literal root matches only the latter — without normalization the protection reads as present while being absent. Three details are load-bearing rather than cosmetic. **Variable expansion is an allowlist** (`_SEARCH_HOME_VARS`: `HOME`, `USERPROFILE`), never `os.path.expandvars`: the value is model-authored and the synthesized target is **audited** — a denied target becomes the security event log's `operation` field — so dereferencing arbitrary variables let an agent pick a path prefix it knew a rule refuses, append `$AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`, and have the deny it deliberately triggered write the expanded secret to a readable log, making the deny matcher itself an exfiltration primitive. The home variables are safe because their value is the home path a home rule already matches on; every other variable stays literal, and an **unset** home variable also stays literal rather than substituting empty, which would turn `$HOME/x` into `/x` and claim a root-scope walk the tool never performs. The **separator rewrite** keeps the grammar OS-independent: `normpath` produces `\` on Windows, so a rule authored with `/` (the form documented here) would silently stop matching there, which fails **open**. The **`//` collapse** is POSIX-only: POSIX leaves a path beginning with exactly two slashes implementation-defined, so `//home/alice` would otherwise reach a `/home/`-anchored rule unmatched, while on Windows a leading `//` is a UNC or extended-length root that must survive intact. Normalization is **lexical only** — no `realpath`, so a symlink into a denied tree is not resolved, and the resolved sensitive-path keystone remains the layer that does not depend on spelling.
- **A relative root is NOT absolutized**, which is a deliberate divergence from `governance._norm_item`. `abspath` resolves against the *gateway process* cwd, not the cwd the tool runs in, and that misattribution cuts both ways: a rule denying the tree actually walked is bypassed, and a rule naming the gateway's own tree falsely denies an unrelated search. Governance absorbs that because it is a policy intersection where an ungoverned scope permits; a hard deny cannot. A relative root therefore stays relative, and no rule keyed on an absolute prefix matches it.
- **Normalization never raises.** `expanduser` raises `ValueError` on a `~name` form carrying an embedded NUL, and this runs inside the permission gate where an exception is a crash rather than a security decision. On any `OSError`/`ValueError` the raw value is returned for encoding, which cannot forge a field.
- **The emitted string is a public grammar.** Operators author rules against these field names, this order, and this encoding, so changing any of them silently breaks or inverts rules already installed. Treat additions as append-only.
- **Rule-anchoring caveat for authors.** Encoding stops a value from minting a field; it cannot make a regex match a path it was not written for. Two consequences: a rule that ends the `path` field with `(?:\s|$)` is evaded by any suffix — `/local/home/alice/x`, or an encoded `%20…` tail — so anchor on the prefix you mean to refuse (`path=/local/home/`) rather than the end of the field. And keep the `=` when you key on a field name: `(?!.*max_depth=)` is unforgeable, while `(?!.*max_depth)` is silenced by a directory literally named `max_depth`, since only `=` and whitespace are encoded.
- **Residual limits — this is defense in depth over the always-on sensitive-path keystone, not a complete sandbox.** The recursive-`operation` set is enumerated, so a tool that walks a tree under some other argument shape produces no target; only singular path spellings are read, so a call passing a `paths`/`files` sequence — or omitting the root entirely to walk the cwd — emits no `path` field for a path-keyed rule to see; and coverage depends on the caller threading `raw_params` at all, exactly as the arg-derived governance scopes do.
- **The synthesized target is evaluated in a tier of its own** (`is_denied_synthesized_target`, `security/`). A synthesized target is not a command line, and running it through the whole shared rule set made the command-oriented built-ins match its argument text: `mkfs.*` denied a read-only search of a directory named `mkfs-tests`, and `.*python.*botocore.*credentials.*` denied a search inside a real virtualenv. Encoding whitespace defuses the multi-token rules (`rm -rf /`, `terraform destroy`, `DROP TABLE`), but nothing defuses a whitespace-free pattern against a path. The only per-rule remedy was disabling that rule by id, which also stopped it protecting real shell commands — so a false positive on a search cost a real control to clear.
  - **Which patterns participate: exactly the ones the caller passes.** The hooks gate passes the operator's own *enabled* `user_added` regexes and their `auto_deny_tools` globs. The shipped built-in catalogue is **not** passed and takes no part in a synthesized target: a built-in cannot express a scope rule for one, so its only possible hit here is the incidental collision above. The companion overlay is evaluated separately (below).
  - **Provenance is structural, not inferred.** An earlier revision passed the merged effective set and classified each pattern by testing its text against the shipped catalogue. Pattern text is not provenance: an operator who authors a pattern whose text coincides with a shipped one (`mkfs.*` is a natural thing to type) had their own rule read as shipped and dropped — a silent fail-open on an explicit deny, reachable with no knowledge of the catalogue and no rule disabled. Passing only what participates removes the classifier, so there is nothing left to misclassify.
  - **Ratchet: no shipped built-in is authored against the grammar.** `test_no_shipped_builtin_is_authored_against_the_grammar` asserts it behaviourally rather than by grepping for the literal (a regex can reference the namespace without containing it — `file.search`, `(?:file|dir)-search`, `\x66ile-search`): for every shipped rule that matches a synthesized target, the match must survive replacing the namespace bytes, i.e. it never depended on them. A future built-in written against this grammar fails the ratchet, which is the signal to give that rule an explicit way into the tier rather than a test to update.
  - **The ADD-only companion overlay keeps its command semantics.** `PolicyAuthority.is_denied_synthesized_target` evaluates the overlay first, through `security.is_denied` with an empty regex tier (empty, not `None` — `None` fails closed to every built-in and would evaluate the whole shipped catalogue against the synthesized target, reinstating the collision). An overlay pattern is opaque enterprise policy, and one restricting a filesystem **scope** is spelled as bare path text (`*forbidden-share*`), so any host-side narrowing of how it is matched could drop a denial its author meant. `assert_security_floor` covers this method in its runtime `@final`-override guard, so a subclass cannot always-allow file-search calls and still pass boot.
  - **`patterns=None` means the regex tier contributes nothing** — deliberately NOT `is_denied`'s fail-closed-to-every-built-in. Getting that backwards would evaluate the whole catalogue against a synthesized target, which is exactly the state this tier exists to leave.
  - **This tier does not run the argv-structural floors** (credential mint, self-kill, restart/update/cloud) **or the verb-anchored git-publish detector**, and does not do per-segment (pass 2) re-evaluation. Each interprets shell syntax a synthesized target does not have: its tokens are the namespace and `key=value` pairs, values are whitespace-encoded so one cannot split into two tokens, and no such target names a program — so a search of a tree cannot mint a credential or kill a process, and splitting only manufactures pseudo-commands out of path substrings. A real command still reaches all of them through its own `command` target.

- `is_denied(tool_name, extra_patterns, *, denied_regexes, reason_notes, session_key)` evaluates the *effective* denied-command set plus a dedicated verb-anchored git-publish detector. The **regex tier** (`denied_regexes`, matched via `re.search`, case-insensitive) is the enabled subset of `BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES` plus the user's `user_added` patterns from the keystone `denied_commands.json` opt-out state, which the hooks layer resolves via `compute_effective_denied(...)` and passes in; the **glob tier** (`extra_patterns`, fnmatch) carries legacy `auto_deny_tools` + the companion overlay. `reason_notes` is an optional `{pattern: operator note}` map (from `hooks.resolve_denied_notes`, forwarded opaquely by `PolicyAuthority.is_denied`) that decorates the refusal text only — it cannot add, remove, or alter a match. "Agent-configured patterns" no longer means a kiro agent JSON `deniedCommands` array — that injection path is retired. When `denied_regexes` is `None` the check fails closed to all built-ins enabled. The git-publish detector runs before either tier and is always-on; the protected-branch **gate** it feeds is default-on but **per-rule disableable** (see the opt-out note in the Protected-branch gate bullet below), except for the anti-obfuscation branches, which no opt-out can reach:

  - **Refusal diagnostic (a LAST line, opt-in per tier):** a refusal may carry a final line naming the rule id that decided, the component inside that tier which decided, and the matched span's OFFSETS and character-class shape — never the matched bytes. It is appended, so line one stays whatever the refusal already said and an operator note keeps the second line it has always had; a reader that stops before it sees exactly what it saw before, and the line shares no prefix with `DENY_REASON_PREFIX` so the recovery card's global per-line regex cannot read it as a second, fabricated pattern. It is opt-in per call site rather than always-on, and the split is not cosmetic: a pattern-tier denial's first line already IS the accurate cause, so a diagnostic there would add a line to every ordinary refusal for no information, while a STRUCTURAL denial (the argv floor, the git-publish floor) reports a pattern the input provably cannot match and is the refusal an agent cannot diagnose at all. So the structural floors pass one, the pattern tiers do not, and a plain catalog refusal stays exactly one line. The keystone bash gate passes one on every refusal it produces, including its over-ceiling refusal, where the span is the whole subject because nothing matched and the reported reason is "not scanned". The same record names an unresolvable governance pin, which used to leave in a set comprehension's filter — reported by shape, never by the pattern an operator authored.
  - **Refusal string (a parsed micro-format, not free text):** the first line is always exactly `f"{DENY_REASON_PREFIX}{matched}"` — `DENY_REASON_PREFIX` is exported from `security/` precisely so guards cannot drift from the producer. It is byte-stable on purpose, because three consumers parse it: `website/src/pages/chat/RecoveryCard.tsx` extracts the pattern with `/Blocked by security policy:\s*(.+?)\s*$/gm`, the test helper `_denied_by` partitions on the exact `"Blocked by security policy: "` separator, and `chat_runner` reads it for display (after redaction). When the matched pattern has an operator note, the note is appended as a **second line** — never on the first, which would be captured as part of the pattern. Because `RecoveryCard`'s regex is GLOBAL and per-line, a note containing the prefix would be parsed as a second, fabricated pattern; that is why notes carrying it are rejected at the endpoint and dropped in `resolve_denied_notes`. Both guards test `DENY_REASON_MATCH_PREFIX` (the colon-terminated form derived from the emitted prefix), NOT the emitted prefix itself: the regex makes the space after the colon optional, so `"Blocked by security policy:forged"` parses as a refusal line without containing the emitted string. Anything added to this format must keep line one intact.
  - **Git publish (verb-anchored regex):** `git push` is detected by `_is_git_publish()` (`_GIT_PUBLISH_RE` + `_GIT_PUBLISH_GLUE_RE`), **not** a substring glob. `push` must be the git *subcommand* (first non-flag token after `git`, allowing intervening `-x` / `-C path` / `-c k=v` options), so a commit message, branch name, grep pattern, or ssh remote payload that merely contains the word "push" is **not** blocked (e.g. `git commit -m '...push...'`, `git log --grep push`, `git switch -c fix/git-push`). Checked on the whole string first to catch command-substitution glue-evasion (`git$(echo ' ')push`, `git\`echo\`push`, `git_push`) and on segment-spanning chains (`git stash push && git push origin main`). Replaces the former broad `*git*push*` glob + ` stash push` exception, which over-blocked benign commands and surfaced as a silent `Tool use aborted` on the removed standalone provider.
  - **Protected-branch gate:** `_is_git_publish()` is a **pure, side-effect-free detector** — it only answers "is this a git push?". Whether the push is *allowed* (feature branch) or *denied* (protected/bare) is decided by `_git_publish_floor_tags()`, which returns the set of **rule-id tags** the command trips, at the single enforcement point in `is_denied` (via a deferred `push_allow_pending` flag), which is also where **both** SEL audits fire: `_emit_deny_event` on deny and `_schedule_push_allow_audit` (SEL `push_allowed`, operation `git_push`) on allow. `_is_push_to_protected_branch()` is retained only as a thin boolean view over the tag set for callers that need the yes/no answer. The `push_allowed` audit is deferred to the *final* allow exit, so a compound `<feature push> && <denied command>` chain that later trips a deny pass logs a **deny**, not an allow. The allow audit is handed the **raw** `tool_name`, not the lowercased matching view: nothing matched on an allow, so the fold buys the record nothing and costs it a case-sensitive branch name (`Feature-ABC` recorded as `feature-abc`) plus the pre-slice credential pass (see "Audit metadata goes through `redact_and_truncate`" above). Pinned by `test_push_branch_gate.py::TestGitPushEnforcement::test_allow_audit_records_the_raw_command_not_the_matching_view`.
    - **Opt-out, and the part of it that is NOT optional.** Each tag names a real git-publish catalog rule, and a tag fires only while its rule is in the enabled set — so an operator CAN disable protected-branch push blocking per rule (or wholesale with `disable_all`) through the keystone `denied_commands.json`. Three branches deliberately bypass that check and deny unconditionally, emitting the sentinel `_GIT_PUBLISH_UNGATED` instead of a rule id: an ambiguous refspec (`_AMBIGUOUS_REFSPEC_RE`), a brace-expansion refspec (`_AMBIGUOUS_EXPANSION_RE`), and the two "cannot parse" fallbacks (unparseable argv, or a push detected upstream with no clean segment). Those are anti-obfuscation, not policy: an operator opting out of a rule is choosing to allow a command shape they can *read*, which is not a licence to allow one nobody can. `git-publish-push-brace-expansion-refspec` is therefore the one git-publish rule that stays **locked** in the Settings panel (`_FLOOR_ENFORCED_RULE_IDS`), because its coverage is an ungated branch and a toggle for it would be a lie. A denial now reports the matched rule's own `pattern`, so it resolves to a `rule_id` in SEL rather than the opaque `git push` label.
    - `_PROTECTED_BRANCHES` covers `main`/`mainline` plus the legacy Git default-branch name (see `_PROTECTED_BRANCHES` in `security/`), plus ambiguous runtime-resolved refs `_AMBIGUOUS_REFS` = {`head`, `@`, `fetch_head`}. A push to any of these (or a **bare** `git push` / `git push <remote>` with no explicit branch, since the current branch might be protected) is denied.
    - `_PUSH_ALL_BRANCHES_OPTS` covers `--mirror`, `--all`, and Git's `--branches` alias are denied **outright** (they push every local branch, so a per-branch target check cannot vouch for them), kept in lockstep with the `--(mirror|all)` regex in `config/defaults.json`.
    - `_is_push_to_protected_branch()` splits the command with `_split_segments()` and validates **every** `push` segment / refspec (closing the `push origin feat && push origin main` bypass), normalizing `refs/heads/…` paths and `local:remote` refspecs; refspecs with shell/revision syntax (`$`, `` ` ``, `@{…}` — `_AMBIGUOUS_REFSPEC_RE`) are treated as ambiguous and denied. If a push was detected upstream but **no** clean segment parses, it denies to be safe.
    - **Force push:** a force flag (`--force` / `-f` / `--force-with-lease`) does not by itself make a feature-branch push protected (force-push to a feature branch is normal PR/rebase workflow), but force-push to a *protected* branch is still blocked because the target check fires regardless of flags.
  - **Self-protection (argv-structural floor):** the controls that stop the agent disabling its own controls — credential minting, process termination, the dev-mode attestation flag, the ssh-family sandbox escape, and the `restart` / `update` / `cloud` / `gateway restart` lifecycle commands — are enforced by dedicated argv predicates. They come in two shapes, and the difference is whether a catalog row exists to gate on:
    - **Row-backed, UNION with the regex tier** (`_SELF_PROTECTION_FLOOR_RULE_IDS`: the credential mint, the self-kill, the dev-mode confirm flag, and `sandbox-escape-ssh-self` — an ssh/scp/sftp/rsync TARGET resolving to this same machine re-enters the host outside the sandbox, so the `_is_ssh_to_self` predicate resolves the operand-position target: options, redirects, `user@`/URI/IPv6/numeric-IP spellings, and this host's own names, the last resolved in a background thread so the gate never blocks on DNS). Enforced by **both** the row's `pattern` in the regex tier **and** the predicate, and the predicate runs only while the row is in the effective set, so an operator who disabled the row has disabled the floor with it. Neither half is sufficient alone, and the floor is deliberately **additive**, never a replacement. This gate is the **interim tier**, not closure of the escape: it sees only tool-routed command lines, so interpreter/script-file indirection (`bash escape.sh`, `python -c` + subprocess/paramiko) and non-ssh-family clients (`git clone ssh://localhost/…`, autossh) still reach the unsandboxed sshd — the sandbox has no network namespace, and the fix of record is an OS-level network fence there (issue #9806).
    - **Floor-only, UNGATED** (`_SELF_PROTECTION_UNGATED_FLOOR_IDS`: `self-protection-restart`, `self-protection-update`, `self-protection-gateway-restart`, `self-protection-cloud`). These four have **no catalog row**: their regex rows fired on the product's name appearing anywhere in a command and were deleted (see "Self-protection global options" above). With no row there is no toggle, so the predicates run unconditionally — like the git-publish anti-obfuscation branches — and a refusal's first line reports the id itself, with the structural note on the second line. The ids are deliberately not catalog ids, and the two sets are pinned disjoint: gating a predicate on a row lookup was how a deleted row became a silently disabled floor (`is_denied` used to `continue` past an id that resolved to no pattern), so a subcommand floor may never rejoin the gated set without its row. `_LEGACY_RULE_ID_BY_PATTERN` carries no alias for those rows for the same reason — a governance pin persisted in either spelling of those rows resolves to nothing, which is the truth: an always-on floor has nothing left to pin. The map aliases only a prior spelling of a row that still exists (the bare-substring spelling of `reverse-shell-nc`, whose row is anchored to the `nc` command token), so a ceiling written against the older catalog keeps pinning that row across the upgrade.
    - **Why the floor exists.** These rules must distinguish a dangerous *invocation* from an incidental *mention*, and raw-text matching cannot: the gap between the product name and the dangerous verb has to tolerate ordinary shell noise (a quoted verb `kirocrew "token"`, global flags, a redirection — bash accepts one anywhere in a simple command, so `kirocrew >/tmp/out token` is a mint), but any character class wide enough for that also spans a filesystem path, and a product-named worktree path (`…/kirocrew-wt-x/test_token_auth.py`) is the false positive the rules must not produce. Quoting cuts the other way too: `pkill -f '[;]*kirocrew'` is a working by-name kill whose quoted `;` textual splitting misreads as a command separator. The floor therefore tokenizes with `normalize_shell_command()` (resolving quoting, empty-string concatenation, `$HOME`/tilde) and matches on **argv**: lifecycle rules recognize both the console script and the documented `python -m kiro_crew` entrypoint, begin after the module operand, and compare the first non-flag CLI words exactly; a Python script, another module, or an ordinary command that merely contains `kiro_crew` remains a mention rather than an invocation. For the mint, a token whose whole *program name* is `kiro[-.]?crew` followed by a later token in the same argv that is exactly `token`; for the kill, `pkill`/`killall` with the name in any argument (unbounded — the target is a pattern, not a path), or a bare `kill` whose PID comes from a command-substitution **body** naming it (walked with paren nesting, so `$(pgrep …)`, `$(pidof …)`, a pidfile read and backticks are all covered without allowlisting a resolver binary). The bare-kill bodies are read through TWO windows with complementary blind spots — a token walk (whose depth counter mis-scores a `case` pattern's `)` as a closer, losing a lookup placed after `case … esac`) and a quote-aware raw-text window (which reaches that clause but sees the quotes) — so each raw body is searched raw, with parameter defaults resolved, and per WORD of its `_self_tokens` view (which folds continuations and swallows an untokenizable body instead of raising out of the gate), each word BARE and through `_resolved_word_view` (defaults resolved, empty substitutions collapsed, bracket classes removed — quote removal composes with the remaining transforms, and the bare member keeps a name a pattern-substitution expansion like `${PATH/usr/|'kiro''crew'|zz-}` would destroy); the per-word transform deliberately avoids `_normalize_operand` (still used by the `pkill` leg, whose own seam is issue #10284), because an operand view truncates at a de-quoted ERE pattern's own characters (`'zz|kiro'crew`) and would discard the protected alternative. Without the composed per-word leg an adjacent-quote concatenation of the name after `esac` (`kill $(case x in x) :;; esac; pgrep -f 'kiro''crew')`) — or the same splice composed with a `[c]` bracket class, an empty `$()`, or a `${x:-crew}` default — sat in the two windows' intersection and was allowed (issue #10205).
    - **Why the regex stays.** A shell's `-c` argument is a *command*, so `bash -c "kirocrew token"` hands the tokenizer one opaque token. The floor closes that class by re-tokenizing literal `sh`/`bash`/`zsh` `-c` payloads and `eval` arguments and checking those argvs too (`_self_token_frames`, depth-capped), but a payload that is not literal (`eval "$CMD"`) has no visible script, and the tokenizer itself can fail (unbalanced quotes). Keeping both `pattern`s in `regex_patterns` means a tokenizer failure or an unseen payload **fails closed** on raw text rather than open. `test_denied_commands_security.py::TestSelfProtectionFloorIsAdditive` pins this: the patterns must stay in the effective set, each pattern must be a true **subset** of its predicate (so the posture-UI text cannot drift from enforcement), and a simulated tokenizer failure must still deny.
    - **Inline interpreter programs are judged on what they NAME, not on whether they mention us.** `python -c` and the stdin forms (`python - <<'PY'`, `echo … | python -`, `python < file`) run arbitrary Python, so the `token` argv word cannot be the mint gate there (the payload can build the verb). The gate is `_inline_payload_reaches_cli`: the payload is a mint when it names the **mint surface** (`_MINT_SURFACE_RE`) — the CLI dispatch (`kiro_crew.cli`, `kiro_crew.__main__`, the console-script entry `kiro_crew._bootstrap`, `from kiro_crew import cli`), the module implementing the `token` subcommand (`kiro_crew.cli_server`), a product module whose path names a token producer (`kiro_crew.dashboard.token_auth`, `kiro_crew.instances.token_mint`, `kiro_crew.dashboard.token_secret`), as an import or as a file path — `secret` is not a path word, since `kiro_crew/dashboard/handlers/secrets.py` is an ordinary module a patch script names — a product import statement together with a **credential word**, `token` or `secret`, anywhere in the payload (`_PRODUCT_IMPORT_RE` + `_MINT_VERB_RE`: `from kiro_crew.slack.gateway import generate_token`, `import kiro_crew.slack.gateway as g; g.generate_token()`, and the second credential — `from kiro_crew.config.loader import read_local_secret` reads the internal secret `/api/token/local` accepts through product code, past the sensitive-path floor that fences `.local_secret` itself; every reader of it carries `secret`, as every producer carries `token`, and `test_the_credential_word_covers_every_local_secret_reader_in_the_tree` derives the reader set from every function that names the file), or the bare package name handed to a dynamic module runner (`_DYNAMIC_RUNNER_NAMES`: `runpy.run_module('kiro_crew', run_name='__main__')` is `python -m kiro_crew` spelled as a call, and `importlib.import_module('kiro_crew')` / `__import__('kiro_crew')` reach the same dispatch by attribute; the runner handed any OTHER name, `__import__('os').environ` next to a product import, is generic code), or the installed console script named as a program next to a code loader (`_INLINE_CODE_LOADER_NAMES` + `_CONSOLE_SCRIPT_LITERAL_RE`: `exec(open(shutil.which('kirocrew')).read())`, `exec(open('/venv/bin/kirocrew').read())` or `runpy.run_path(shutil.which('kirocrew'))` runs the entry point's `_bootstrap.main()` in-process against a `sys.argv` the payload chose; the loader on any other file, `exec(open('patch.py').read())`, is a patch-script idiom, and the program name in a `subprocess` argv is the interpreter-argv companion rule's sink). `test_the_mint_surface_covers_every_token_producer_in_the_tree` derives the producer set from the tree (the function that opens `token_signing.key`, then two import hops) and asserts each is a reach. Before matching, `_fold_inline_literals` joins `'a' + 'b'` literal runs and `_decoded_b64_literals` decodes every base64-shaped literal of the folded command **as submitted** (`is_denied` hands the mint predicate `raw_text=` for this: base64 does not survive the lower-casing the rest of the floor reads), so `__import__('kiro_crew.c'+'li')` and `os.system(b64decode('a2lyb2NyZXcgdG9rZW4='))` (`kirocrew token`) are read as what they hide. A payload that merely mentions the package (a `Path(...)` under `src/kiro_crew/` in a patch script), imports an unrelated product module (`from kiro_crew.acp import x`), or uses `getattr`/`eval`/`importlib` with no product name in reach is **not** a mint. The earlier reading — any `kiro_crew` mention, or any dynamic-exec primitive at all, denied the whole inline program as opaque — produced 143 of the audit log's 179 bash-gate denials over eight days with zero mints among them; the un-disableable guarantee for the credential was always the sensitive-path floor over the signing key, which this heuristic sits in front of. Pinned by `test_argv_floor_inline_and_brace_scope.py::TestInlinePayloadNamesTheMintSurface`.
    - **A glob in a token is what bash would make of it, and only in a position bash would run it.** `_glob_to_regex` mirrors brace expansion exactly: `{a,b}` is one word per alternative, `{c..c}` / `{a..z}` a sequence, and a brace group with no top-level comma and no `..` (`{state}`, `{print $1}`, `{directory}`) is **left literal**, braces included — it used to read as `.*`, so every quoted jq filter or awk program was a word that "could expand to `pkill`", and a product-named path later in the same argv denied the command. Nesting is capped at `_BRACE_NESTING_CAP` (past it a group reads as `.*`, the fail-closed direction), and brace pairs are resolved once per word in one linear pass (`_brace_pairs`), so a word of thousands of unbalanced braces is judged in linear time rather than the quadratic per-brace scan that stalled the synchronous gate long enough for the loop watchdog to hard-exit the gateway. The regex the translation produces is bounded too: a word spends at most `_BRACE_GROUP_BUDGET` alternation groups (past it a group is `.*`), identical alternatives (`{*,*}`) collapse to one branch before the budget is charged, and consecutive `.*` pieces collapse to one — so `{*,*}{*,*}…` or `{*,**}{*,**}…` fifteen deep, which as a naive regex has 2^15 ways to fail a five-letter name and takes seconds per protected name, answers in milliseconds. Only glob and brace syntax is read; a **command substitution** (`$(...)`, a backtick) is literal text to this reader: what it prints is outside a static floor -- exactly as at program position, where `$(printf pk)ill -f <name>` is the documented residual -- and its BODY is judged on its own by the payload walk, which descends into every substitution wherever it sits (`tar czf x_$(pkill -f kirocrew).tgz` is denied for the body). Reading the substitution as `.*` instead made every host-stamped filename (`logs_$(hostname)_*.tar.gz` under `tar`, `zip`, `gh`, `install`, `Copy-Item`) and every brace group with a substituted alternative (`mv {$(date +%F),current}.log <dir>`, `rsync -a {$(date +%F),default}.conf <dir>`) a word that "could be `pkill`" whenever a product-named path followed -- three rounds of scope-review regressions, no kill among them. Parameter expansion (`${X}`, `$X`) stays literal, as it already is at program position (`$X -f <name>` is a residual outside this floor): reading it as anything turned every awk field list (`{print $6,$7}`) and every prose heredoc naming `${name}` into a possible verb. Two argv facts complete it: a filesystem inspector (`ls`, `stat`, `file`, `du`, `readlink`, `realpath`, `dirname`, `basename`) and a filesystem mover (`cp`, `mv`, `ln`, `rm`, `mkdir`, `rmdir`, `touch`, `chmod`, `chown`; `tar` deliberately not, its `-I` runs a program) are `_DATA_CONSUMER_PROGRAMS` entries, so a glob among their arguments (`ls -d dir/*`, `cp $dir/*`) is a filename, not a program; and `_data_consumer_exempt` keeps that exemption for an argument glued to a TRAILING operator (`cp $dir/*;`), because the operator starts no program inside the token, while it still refuses one with a program after the operator (`echo x;kirocrew`) and one that OPENS with a command substitution (`ls $(kirocrew update)`, `cat `kirocrew token``: the word's basename reading is the body's program, which runs). A substitution LATER in the word (`cp report_$(hostname)_*.log <dir>`) or inside a brace group (`mv {$(date +%F),current}.log <dir>`) keeps the exemption: the word is a filename around a body, and the body is judged on its own by the payload walk (`echo foo_$(pkill -f kirocrew)` and `ls {$(pkill -f kirocrew),y}` are denied for the body). The exemption is gated on the program being a data consumer on purpose: the tokens it reads have had their quotes removed, so a trailing operator at PROGRAM position (`'/tmp/kirocrew;' token`, a symlink literally named with the semicolon) is never read as an argv boundary — the verb after it is still scanned and the mint denied; `x;pkill -f kirocrew` still runs `pkill` and is still denied. 13 denials in the same eight days came from the old reading, 8 of them on commands containing no `kill` at all. Pinned by `TestBraceExpansionMirrorsBash` and `TestAGlobArgumentIsNotAKillProgram` in the same file.
    - **Platform note.** `normalize_shell_command()` expands `$HOME` via `re.sub` with a **callable** replacement, not a string. A str replacement is parsed as a template, and on Windows the home path (`C:\Users\…`) contains `\U` — an invalid escape — so a string replacement raised `re.error` for *every* input on that platform, silently emptying the token list and disabling both this floor and the git-publish normalizer second-pass.
  - **Interpreter argv literal (`credential-exfil-kirocrew-token-argv`):** a separate, narrow rule for the one shape neither half above can reach — an interpreter payload that spawns the CLI through a **library call** rather than as a shell word (`python -c "subprocess.run(['kirocrew','token'])"`, `node -e 'execFileSync("kirocrew",["token"])'`, `perl -e 'system("kirocrew","token")'`). The floor cannot help: the payload is one opaque token to the shell tokenizer and its contents are Python/JS, not shell. Scoped to the two words as **adjacent quoted arguments**, with a separator class admitting only what appears *between* argv elements (quote, comma, whitespace, opening bracket/paren) and deliberately excluding `.`, `*`, `/` and `>` — that exclusion is what keeps a regex **literal** quoting this very rule (`re.search(r'.*kirocrew.*token', cmd)`) and prose naming both words from matching, both recorded false positives. It carries a second alternative for the **single-string** spelling (`os.system("kirocrew token")`), which is **sink-qualified**: the two words inside one quoted string match only when that string is the argument of a call that EXECUTES it (`os.system`, `os.popen`, `subprocess.run`, `shell_exec`, `execSync`, `system`, `popen`, …). The sink prefix is what makes this safe — it is precisely what a regex literal, a commit message and `console.log(...)` lack, so those stay allowed while the executing form does not. A sibling rule `self-protection-kill-interpreter` does the same for a kill command (`os.system("pkill -f kirocrew")`). **Residual gap:** an interpreter that ASSEMBLES the name at runtime (string concatenation, a base64 blob, an HTTP call to the gateway) never contains it for any pattern to find. The un-disableable guarantee for this credential remains the sensitive-path floor over `token_signing.key`, which these rules do not replace. The sink set includes the asyncio spawners (`asyncio.create_subprocess_shell` / `_exec`, with the module prefix optional since the bare name is importable), which execute their argument the same way.
  - **Pass 1 (whole-string glob):** every deny glob is matched against the full input. If a pattern matches and no exception pattern also matches the full input, the command is denied immediately. This closes evasion vectors where the deny string spans a shell separator boundary.
  - **Pass 2 (per-segment glob):** only runs if pass 1 found a glob match AND the full input also matched at least one exception. The input is split on shell separators (`;`, `&&`, `||`, `|`, `&`, `$()`, backticks, newlines) into independent segments, and each segment is re-evaluated. `_DENY_EXCEPTIONS` carries one scoped carve-out (#8802): the two `local-destructive-rm-rf-*` rules are excepted for a segment that BEGINS with a read-only search verb (`grep`/`egrep`/`fgrep`), so searching for those rules' own literals is not treated as running them — which prevented nothing, since the payload completes from a file the gate never scans. Three conditions carry that safety, and each one closed a real bypass found in review: the globs are **verb-anchored** with no leading `*` (a leading `*` is an unanchored substring test under `fnmatch`, and `*/grep *` would exonerate `rm -rf / /bin/grep x`); `_exception_eligible` requires the view to be a **single plain command** — no `$` `` ` `` `( ) { } < >` and no separator (`|` `;` `&` newline), because the separator list above covers neither `<(` / `>(` / `${` nor a bare `(`, and such a construct otherwise stays glued inside a search-verb segment and still executes — a character class rather than a list of opener spellings, which lost twice (to `<(`, then to a bash 5.3 funsub); the separators are refused for the Pass 1 whole-string view specifically, so an exception cannot speak for a compound command whose later stage executes what the search emitted (`grep '<literal>' payload.py | python`); and the verb list is confined to the `grep` family because the premise is that the verb cannot execute its operands, which is a property of the tool (`rg --pre <cmd>` and `ack --pager <cmd>` do execute, so both are excluded). Path-qualified invocations are likewise not excepted: a glob cannot express "the first token's basename is the verb". An exception is granted only if its SEL `deny_exception` audit write succeeds, so the path is fail-closed.
  - SEL audit events emitted on every denial (`deny_event`, recorded under the `git push` label for git-publish) and every exception grant (`deny_exception`).

**kiro-cli `autoAllowReadonly` removed.** The `toolsSettings.execute_bash.autoAllowReadonly: true` flag in `config/defaults.json` is gone — kiro-cli no longer self-approves read-only bash upstream of the gate (which would let those calls skip `hooks.py` entirely). Kiro Crew now performs read-only auto-approve itself inside `hooks.on_tool_call`, placed **AFTER** the sensitive-path, deny-floor, and governance checks, so a deny always wins over the read-only fast-path (see "Read-only auto-approve" below).

**Agent-config injection retired.** Kiro Crew no longer injects `deniedCommands` into `~/.kiro/agents/*.json`. `agent._enforce_denied_commands()`, the ~60s `CleanupHook('denied_commands', …)` re-enforce loop (`session.py`), and the `agent.enforce_denied_commands` config scope (`all`/`kirocrew`) are all removed. Enforcement is hooks-gate-only, so a kiro agent config that edits or omits `deniedCommands` cannot weaken Kiro Crew's ceiling — the gate is authoritative (cross-ref `governance.md` Plane A/B).

### Push verdict: the gateway publishes, so the guard's answer cannot be skipped (`security/push_verdict.py`)

The prepare-pr skill's pre-push stale-base guard answered its question by PRINTING it, so a
publish whose guard was skipped was byte-identical to one whose guard passed. The fix is that
the gateway, not the agent, performs the push: the agent cannot be trusted to act on an answer
only it can see, so it never holds publish authority at all. One operation runs the guard,
re-checks the state the judging assumed, and pushes — the judged commit reaches the remote or
nothing does, with no persisted pass in between for anything to spend later.

- **The gateway is the judge AND the publisher.** `POST /api/push-verdict/run`
  (`dashboard/handlers/push_verdict.py`) executes the guard itself and then pushes. The agent's
  MCP tool only PRESENTS a request; it writes nothing, and its request body reaches no decision.
  Evidence the gated party could write would not be evidence, and signing does not help when the
  key is as readable as the file — so the design keeps NO persisted verdict for the agent to
  write, read, or spend. The publish happens inside this one call and nothing about it outlives
  the call.
- **The push SOURCE is the judged commit, out of the gateway's mirror.** `_publish` pushes
  `<candidate ref>:refs/heads/<source_ref>`, where the candidate ref is the one the guard was
  pointed at. So what lands is what was examined, whatever the worktree says by now. Re-reading
  the worktree at push time would reopen the window in the last place it could still be opened,
  which is why the refs now outlive the judging: `_run_guard` hands them back and the operation
  removes them in its `finally` (an exception inside the runner cleans up there, the one exit the
  caller cannot reach).
- **The state the judging assumed is re-checked immediately before the push.** `HEAD` must still
  be the judged commit (`head_moved`) and the effective remote and its push URL must still be
  the ones validated (`target_moved`); either having moved refuses rather than publishes, with
  409, because something moved underneath a judgement and the honest answer is to judge again.
  The target is re-resolved through the SAME `_effective_push_target` the route used, not a
  second copy of git's precedence.
- **The lease is the gateway's own reading of the remote.** The push carries
  `--force-with-lease=refs/heads/<ref>:<tip>` where `<tip>` comes from `_remote_tip`. A plain
  push would refuse every rebase, which is the workflow this guard exists to serve, and a bare
  `--force` would discard whatever arrived meanwhile. The expected value is never accepted from
  the caller: a lease against an agent-supplied SHA would let the agent describe a remote state
  that never existed, so the lease value is always the gateway's own `_remote_tip` reading.
- **Under activation the floor denies EVERY agent publish outright.** The agent never holds
  publish authority at all: the gateway judges the commit and does the push itself, so an
  agent-visible `git push` has no legitimate reason to run. On an activated install the floor
  therefore refuses every one of them (`git-publish-agent-denied`), with no receipt to match and
  no tree-binding to resolve. An earlier design let the floor ALLOW an agent push that matched a
  recorded receipt and bound each thing the publish named (branch, remote, refspec) to the
  recorded verdict — but that receipt only ever exists for the instant the gateway's own push
  holds it, so matching it bought nothing and WAS the authority this gate removes. One flat
  refusal does the same job with none of the binding, mismatch, mutation-observation,
  redirect-detection or invalidation machinery, all of which were deleted as dead surface.
- **A present but malformed activation leaf REFUSES.** Unparseable bytes already raised; a
  document that parses but is not an object, or whose `enabled` is present and not a real
  boolean, used to read as off — a fail-open with a narrower entrance than the parse error, since
  truncating the leaf to `[]` or writing `{"enabled": 1}` silently disabled the gate on an
  installation whose operator had turned it on. Only a real `true` or `false` is an operator's
  intent; an absent key (or an explicit `null`, indistinguishable from absent through `.get()`)
  stays the never-activated reading, which is off.
- **The floor reads process memory only.** The publish branch of `is_denied` resolves the
  activation reading from this process (no receipt file, no ref read, no subprocess, no network)
  because that branch runs inside the permission gate, where a slow mount is a stall of every
  task in the process. An async caller resolves activation off the event loop and passes it in,
  so even that one file read never runs on the loop.
- **The presenter speaks the route's vocabulary.** The route answers `published` (the gateway
  performed the push), `not_published` (it judged the branch but the push did not land),
  `refused`, `not_activated` or
  `error` and sends `base`; `mcp_tools/push_verdict.py` matches those exact names. A presenter
  matching a name the route does not emit renders a real outcome as an unrecognised verdict to
  the one reader who has to act on it, so the names are a contract with a test driving every
  exit.
- **Activation is TRUSTED and the operator's.** `activation()` reads the
  `ACTIVATION_LEAF` file, `push-verdict-activation.json`, a flat crew-home leaf listed in
  `security.paths._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` (read+write protected on the tool path) and in
  `sandbox`'s `_CREW_READONLY_LEAVES`, `_CREW_CHILD_WITHHELD_LEAVES` and
  `_CREW_PRECREATE_READONLY_FILE_LEAVES` (mounted read-only for the shell). Those four
  entries ARE the claim that the agent cannot write it, and it is the same placement and
  protection the computer-use primary enable has, for the same reason. Only a real JSON
  `true` activates, so a leaf carrying the string `"false"` or the number `1` does not.
  `config.json` may REQUEST activation; only the keystone AUTHORIZES it.
- **The same leaf pins the guard's digest, and that pin is the trust anchor.** `guard_sha256`
  is read from the keystone and nowhere else, so config can REQUEST activation but cannot
  authorize it and cannot say which guard bytes are acceptable. A malformed value — wrong type,
  wrong length, or 64 characters of non-hex — reads as ABSENT rather than as a digest that never
  matches, because only absence produces the refusal that tells an operator to pin one. With
  gating active and nothing pinned, no guard runs at all.
- **The same leaf also pins the push DESTINATION.** `pinned_push_url` anchors where the publish
  may land the way `guard_sha256` anchors which guard bytes are acceptable. The push destination
  is otherwise resolved from the agent-writable worktree git config, so an ordinary `git remote
  set-url` before the request would point the credential-exempt gateway publish at an
  attacker-chosen same-history repository — and the publish-time re-resolution only compares the
  freshly-resolved target to itself, catching a change AFTER judging rather than a destination
  the agent chose before it. The one value the agent cannot write is one an operator pinned in
  the keystone, so a pinned destination is the binding that closes "agent picks the
  destination". It is empty when the operator pinned none, leaving the destination unconstrained
  exactly as on an install that never activated.
- **Absence and unreadability are different facts.** Absence returns false: nobody activated
  gating, and an installation that never activates is judged exactly as before. A leaf that
  EXISTS but cannot be read or parsed raises `ActivationUnreadable`, and the floor turns that
  into a publish refusal (`git-publish-activation-unreadable`) naming the file to repair.
  Answering false there would be a fail-OPEN: corrupting one file would disable the gate on an
  installation whose operator had turned it on, which is an off switch reachable by damage
  rather than by authorization. Refusing costs nothing on installations that never activated,
  because those never reach the raising branch.
- **Activation survives a restart; nothing else persists.** The leaf is on disk so an
  operator does not silently lose a control they turned on. There is no verdict store to
  survive OR to clear: the gateway judges and publishes in one call and keeps no pass, so a
  restart costs at most one guard re-run on the next request and can never leave a stale pass
  behind. The guard runs fresh for every publish by construction, not by an expiry.
- **The activation read is LIVE on every publish, deliberately.** The floor's contract is that it
  does no expensive I/O, and an `open()` plus a JSON parse per publish is a fair objection to
  that. A stat-keyed cache of the parse was written and then removed: modification time, size and
  inode cannot tell two writes of the SAME byte length within one clock tick apart, and the value
  it would serve is an ENABLE decision, so its failure mode is the gate reading as off after an
  operator turned it on. A test pins the live read so the cheap-but-wrong version does not return.
  The file is a few bytes an operator wrote, read locally and never over a network.
- **It runs the REAL guard, not a second copy of its logic — but from the gateway's own
  snapshot.** The handler executes the packaged
  `builtin_skills/kirocrew-dev/kirocrew-prepare-pr/scripts/push_guard.py` on that script's own
  contract — exit `0` SAFE, `40` REFUSED, anything else an environment failure — and publishes
  only on `0`. Every other exit publishes NOTHING, so a failure to judge is indistinguishable
  from never having asked, which the floor denies. The script grew `--base-ref`,
  `--candidate-ref` and `--no-fetch` so its four checks (fetch freshness, ancestry, ahead-count,
  patch-id replay) can be pointed at other refs, which is what lets the gateway run them OUT OF
  PLACE. Re-implementing them here would be both a weaker verdict than it claims and a grammar
  that drifts from the one the skill documents.
- **What executes is a copy inside the sealed directory, never the installation tree's own
  file.** In an editable or source install the packaged guard IS a file in the repository the
  agent edits, so executing it there would hand the gated party the script that authorizes it:
  edit it to print `SAFE TO PUSH`, and every push is recorded as checked. Two things answer it
  and neither is sufficient alone. The PIN is the authority: `_guard_snapshot(digest)` hashes the
  packaged bytes and refuses unless they equal the keystone's `guard_sha256`, which is the one
  statement about those bytes written outside the tree they live in. The SNAPSHOT is what
  executes, inside the sealed `push-verdict-mirrors` directory (tmp+rename), so nothing can swap
  the file between the digest check and the interpreter opening it. The snapshot is refreshed
  whenever it disagrees with the pin, which is safe precisely BECAUSE the pin rather than the
  copy's age authorizes the bytes. A copy taken once on first use could not do that: it made
  TIMING the authority, so an edit landing before any verdict was ever requested became the
  authorized version permanently. No trustworthy copy means no verdict — the run refuses rather
  than falling back to the writable file — and an unpinned installation is told to pin rather
  than told its bytes mismatched, because only the first of those sentences is actionable.
- **A project change no longer drops a verdict, because there is nothing to drop.** The agent
  holds no publish authority under activation, so a verdict a session might carry across a
  project change is never SPENDABLE by the agent in the first place. The `_ChatSlot.project`
  setter is a plain attribute set again — the earlier invalidation hooks it carried were part of
  the receipt surface that was deleted.
- **The verdict's audit is fail-closed, and that requires `critical=True`.** `log_api_access`
  defaults to a non-critical ENQUEUE that returns success even when the write fails, so ordering
  the calls would be decoration on its own. The critical form writes synchronously and re-raises,
  which is why it runs off the event loop through `asyncio.to_thread` — the shape `cron.py` uses
  for a record that must land before its promoting write. Audit first, publish second, and a
  failed audit refuses with `500 audit_failed` having published nothing.
- **The worktree is never written; the judging happens in a mirror the gateway owns.** One bare
  repository per repository, under `push-verdict-mirrors` in the crew home, keyed on a digest of
  the git directory so one repository gets one mirror however many branches or worktrees it has.
  The gateway primes it with two fetches whose DIRECTIONS are the design: the base comes from the
  remote, so it is the fresh tip rather than whatever the worktree last saw, and the candidate is
  fetched OUT of the worktree, which reads it and writes only into the mirror. A fetch INTO the
  worktree would both modify the state being judged and fail outright on its own `FETCH_HEAD`
  once that tree is read-only. Every worktree-scoped git call in the handler is a read.
- **Each judgement gets its OWN pair of refs, and the judged pair is read from them.** The
  refs are namespaced under `refs/kirocrew/push-verdict/<token>/`, minted per request and deleted
  by the request that minted them. Fixed names were a correctness bug rather than an untidiness:
  one mirror serves one REPOSITORY, so two sessions judging two of its branches at once wrote the
  same two refs, the second fetch replaced the first's candidate, and the guard then measured one
  session's branch and answered for the other's. `head` and `base_sha` are resolved from those
  refs inside the mirror, which are the only two commits the guard can examine. Re-reading the
  worktree's `HEAD` after the run was the matching gap: a commit landing in between was recorded
  as judged while nothing had judged it.
- **The mirror is sealed like the activation leaf, but in the DIRECTORY dispositions only**, in
  `paths._CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`, `sandbox._CREW_READONLY_LEAVES` and
  `_CREW_CHILD_WITHHELD_LEAVES`, for a sharper reason than the enable: a mirror the agent can
  write is a mirror in which the agent plants the base its own push is then measured against. It
  is materialised before any sandbox starts by `_CREW_PRECREATE_READONLY_DIR_LEAVES`, and its
  name is held unreplaceable by `_CREW_NOFOLLOW_READONLY_DIR_LEAVES` with the reason entry that
  list requires — a fence seals an EXISTING path, so on a fresh activated install the mirror root
  was absent, the read-only mount was skipped, and the name the agent would create was exactly the
  one the listing exists to deny. It is deliberately NOT in
  `_CREW_PRECREATE_READONLY_FILE_LEAVES`, which pre-creates each entry as
  an empty FILE — listing a directory there materializes a file at the mirror's path and the
  first `mkdir` raises, disabling the feature outright while looking like protection. The
  gateway writes the mirror directly, not through the tool gate.
- **Every git the handler launches goes through ONE routed spawn.** `_run_git` wraps
  `sandboxed_spawn_argv` (via `sandbox.shielded_prepare_off_loop`) and launches with
  `create_subprocess_limited`, so the child gets filesystem isolation, a scrubbed environment and
  a kernel resource ceiling. One site rather than one per caller, because the repository's spawn
  audit reads the enclosing FUNCTION and each extra site is another place the routing can be
  forgotten. The neutralized git environment is that helper's DEFAULT, so a git call added later
  cannot arrive unprotected by omission.
- **Executable git configuration is neutralized for every git the gateway launches.** The
  worktree being judged is agent-writable while this code runs in the gateway process, outside
  the agent's sandbox, so an agent that writes `core.sshCommand` into its own `.git/config`
  would otherwise have the gateway run that command at gateway privilege just by asking for a
  verdict. `git_env()` passes the neutralizations as `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT` environment entries
  rather than `-c` arguments, because those have the highest precedence git offers **and** are
  inherited, so they also govern the git processes the guard script starts for itself.
  Documented as a denylist: git offers no switch that ignores repository configuration, so this
  closes every directive git documents today as running a program. It is the SECOND of two
  layers, not the answer on its own — the first is that every one of these spawns is confined by
  the sandbox and judges a mirror rather than the worktree, so a directive that does run reaches
  neither the gateway's credentials nor the tree being judged.
- **It runs the PACKAGED copy**, resolved through `skills._BUILTIN_SKILLS_DIR`, never the copy
  installed into the user's skills directory: that copy is agent-writable, so running it
  would hand the gated party the check that authorizes it.
- **It PINS the base** rather than letting the script auto-detect, so the base recorded in the
  verdict is the base that was judged. The base is the repository's default branch from
  `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, NOT the branch's upstream — a feature branch already pushed once
  has its own remote branch as upstream, and staleness measured against that is satisfied by
  construction. The GATEWAY does the fetching, into its own mirror, which is correct in a tool
  call the agent awaits; the script is run with `--no-fetch` and the permission gate itself still
  reads process memory only. Out of place, the guard's diagnostic readings name the refs it
  actually compared; its remedy prose keeps naming `origin/<base>` and `HEAD`, which are the
  right names for the human standing in their own worktree reading it.
- **An unactivated installation banks nothing.** The route answers `not_activated` and records
  no verdict: with gating off the floor never reads one, so storing a pass would leave a banked
  receipt to be spent the moment an operator did activate.
- **The subsystem is NOT on the gateway boot path.** `handlers/__init__.py` deliberately does
  not import the module — the deferral `work_ledger` already uses — and `server.py` reaches it
  through `_deferred_push_verdict` at registration time. A test parses that package as an AST
  rather than grepping it, because the module's name appears in comments and a count pins nothing.
- **Activation preconditions, stated because they are refusals an operator will meet.** The base
  is the repository's default branch and nothing else, since a base named in a request body is a
  bypass. The consequence is that a branch NOT based on the default branch — a release-branch
  hotfix, a stacked pull request — cannot satisfy the guard's ancestry check, so on an activated
  installation it cannot be published at all. That is a limit of the gate, not a defect in the
  branch, and an operator should know it before turning this on.
- **Activation withdraws ALL agent-side git/gh authentication — not only the publish floor.**
  Activation is **Linux-only**. On an activated LINUX installation `_push_verdict_masks_ssh` masks
  every AGENT subprocess (the gateway-owned publish is exempt): the namespace launcher hides
  `~/.ssh` and re-scrubs `SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, withholds `GH_TOKEN`/`GITHUB_TOKEN`, hides
  `.config/gh`/`.git-credentials`/`.netrc`, and resets `credential.helper` to empty with
  `GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`; on the Windows/delegated tier (no launcher, no OS sandbox) the child's
  git-over-SSH is given `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` with `-F none -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o IdentityFile=none
  -o IdentityAgent=none` so it presents no key from disk OR agent. On **macOS the agent child
  cannot be isolated** this way: the git credential lives in the OS keychain, reachable by any
  binary the child can run over `securityd` Mach IPC, and the only Seatbelt rule that closes that
  — a process-wide `(deny mach-lookup (global-name "com.apple.securityd"))` — also severs the
  agent CLI's own keychain sign-in and this process's Security.framework TLS. A file mask and a
  name-based `process-exec*` deny of the keychain helper are both bypassable (a child-controlled
  copy of the helper runs under a name no rule matches). So on macOS an activated agent spawn
  **fails closed**: `_build_seatbelt_profile` raises `SandboxCeilingUnsealable` and the spawn does
  not happen (the gateway-owned publish is exempt and still builds a profile). The consequence on
  Linux is a deliberate availability cliff: an agent on an activated install can no longer
  authenticate ANY git operation — `fetch`/`clone` and `gh pr create` included, not just `push` —
  so a workflow that needs the agent to authenticate to a remote must run its authenticated step
  through the gateway-owned path (or off an activated install). This is the point of the gate (an
  opaque subprocess must not hold publish authority), stated here because an operator activating
  from the "only the publish-floor refusals" summary would otherwise meet it as a silent failure
  days later.
- **Activation retires live agents that predate it.** The mask is baked into a spawn's sandbox
  wrap and is fixed for that process's lifetime, and activation is a manual keystone write with
  no watcher. So a process spawned while gating was OFF would keep full git credentials after an
  operator activates it. `AcpRuntime._is_stale` and `AcpClient.ensure_ready` detect this drift
  (spawned-OFF, now-ON) and recycle the process — and the per-tool-call permission gate refuses a
  tool call from such a stale child mid-turn and retires it — so the child is rebuilt under the
  credential mask before it can publish. An in-flight turn on a pre-activation child therefore
  sees its next tool call refused and the child respawned, which an operator should expect when
  activating during active work. A proactive between-turns sweep
  (`WarmSessionPool._activation_drift_sweep_loop` calling `AcpClient.sweep_pre_activation_runtimes`)
  reaps a CLAIMED/live pre-activation runtime the per-tool-call gate would not reach until its
  next call. The loop is armed unconditionally at `start_pool` and resolves activation on EACH
  tick (the reaper reads the keystone and reaps only when the gate is on), so a gateway that
  booted with the gate OFF and was activated LIVE is still swept — arming only when activation
  was true at startup left exactly that case unswept. A plain install that never activates pays
  only a cheap keystone read per health interval and reaps nothing. It runs in its own loop,
  independent of the warm pool, so it covers the default `pool_size=0` install where the
  pool-health loop never starts.
- **Re-pinning is part of upgrading.** Any release that changes `push_guard.py` changes its
  digest, and an activated installation then refuses every publish until an operator writes the
  new `guard_sha256`. The digest of the packaged script is
  `python3 -c "import hashlib,pathlib,sys; print(hashlib.sha256(pathlib.Path(sys.argv[1]).read_bytes()).hexdigest())" <path to push_guard.py>`,
  and the refusal names both the digest it found and the one pinned, so the value to write is in
  the message. This belongs on the release checklist rather than in code: a product that re-pinned
  itself would be pinning on its own say-so, which is the property the pin exists to remove.
- **Route auth.** Listed in `server._STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS` and registered in
  `_register_mcp_routes`, the one registrar both servers call — a route present on one server
  and absent on the other is the drift that becomes an auth bypass. The handler re-asserts
  loopback AND `internal_auth` itself, because frozenset membership does not prove the secret
  was checked: with the header absent the middleware falls through to cookie auth, and
  `local_only=False` reclassifies strict paths as mixed.

### Denied-command rules, opt-out state, and read-only auto-approve

**`DeniedCommandRule` model** — a frozen dataclass in `security/` with fields
`id: str` (a stable slug, e.g. `credential-exfil-s3-cp`; the opt-out key AND the
SEL audit key), `pattern: str` (a Python regex matched via `re.search`,
case-insensitive), `category: str`, and `description: str` (one human sentence
for the UI). `BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES: list[DeniedCommandRule]` is the canonical
default-ON catalog spanning the categories `aws-destructive`,
`credential-exfil`, `iac-teardown`, `local-destructive`, `pipe-to-shell`, `sql`,
`self-protection`, `git-publish`, and `reverse-shell`. There is no `sensitive-file-read`
category: a row matching a credential-store path in command text duplicates the
sandbox's bind-mask and `is_sensitive_path`, and refuses read-only work.
`BUILTIN_DENY_PATTERNS` is retained as a derived alias
(`[r.pattern for r in BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES]`).

**Effective-set resolver** — `compute_effective_denied(rules, disabled_ids,
disable_all, user_added, governance_pins)` is a pure, order-preserving, deduped
function returning the regex-tier list: include a rule's pattern if
`(not disable_all and id not in disabled_ids) OR id in governance_pins`, then
append `user_added` verbatim. Governance pins win — a pinned rule is re-added
even if the user disabled it or set disable-all (tightest-wins). The hooks gate
computes this once per tool call via `HookManager._effective_denied(ctx)` and
passes it as `denied_regexes` into `is_denied`.

**Edition-contributed rules — the `denied_rules` seam.** A composed edition can
contribute additional `DeniedCommandRule` records through the
`DeniedRuleProvider` platform adapter (`current_context().denied_rules`).
`security.edition_denied_rules()` reads and validates them and
`hooks.resolve_effective_denied_regexes` unions them into the `rules` argument of
`compute_effective_denied`, so a contributed rule is **default-ON and resolved by
exactly the same opt-out arithmetic as a built-in**: an operator can disable it by
id or clear it with `disable_all` through the existing keystone file and the
existing `/api/security/denied-commands` endpoints, and Settings → Security lists
it (tagged `source="edition"`) alongside the built-ins.

This is deliberately the opposite half of `SecurityOverlay.extra_deny_patterns`,
which remains the un-weakenable floor: overlay patterns travel the GLOB tier via
`extra_patterns` and no opt-out can reach them. An edition picks per pattern —
floor, or default-on-but-overridable. Consequences of that split, all pinned by
`test/test_denied_rule_seam.py`:

- **Regex, not glob.** A contributed `pattern` is a Python regex on the regex
  tier. Moving a pattern over from the overlay requires rewriting it; a glob's
  `*` are quantifiers as a regex.
- **Namespaced ids.** `disabled_ids` is one flat set, so an id colliding with a
  built-in id is skipped (the built-in wins) rather than letting one rule's
  toggle move another's.
- **Not pinnable (v1).** Governance `commands`-scope pins resolve a pattern to a
  rule id against the static catalog, so a pin cannot name a contributed rule. An
  edition needing an un-opt-out-able pattern keeps using the overlay.
- **Fail-soft.** A raising or absent provider yields no contributed rules; the
  built-in catalog and the overlay floor are unaffected.
- **Full-input matching, or not published.** The matcher has two engines: a
  forward-only *fragment* matcher that splits a pattern on its top-level `.*` and
  scans the WHOLE input, and an exact whole-regex `re.search` over a
  length-capped window (`_DENY_FALLBACK_SCAN_MAX_CHARS`, 2000). The capped engine
  exists because Python's backtracking `re` cannot give exact semantics AND
  full-input AND ReDoS-safety at once, and it is required only for a pattern the
  fragment matcher would UNDER-match: one with a top-level alternation, or whose
  non-final fragments can over-consume across a `.*` gap. A pattern that splits
  into **one** fragment (no top-level `.*`) needs neither trade-off — there is no
  gap to backtrack across, so its single `re.search` is already exact AND
  full-input — and it therefore takes the unbounded path whoever authored it:
  built-in, edition-contributed, or user-added. This matters because a rule
  enforced over only a 2000-char prefix is bypassed by padding the command
  (`env PAD=<2001 chars> <denied cmd>`), which is not a guarantee the Settings
  panel should show as enforcing. So a contributed pattern that WOULD land on the
  capped engine is **skipped, not published** (`_matches_full_input`, the same
  principle as the `is_safe_user_regex` screen above): an edition rewrites the gap
  as a bounded class such as `[^;&|\n]*`, which keeps the pattern one fragment, or
  uses the un-weakenable overlay if it truly needs the loose form. Note the gate
  evaluates shell segments separately, so a pad behind a `;` was never the
  exposure — only a pad inside the SAME segment as the needle.
- **Discoverable in the panel.** A contributed row carries `source: "edition"` in
  the snapshot and renders an `edition` badge with a tooltip in
  Settings → Security, so an operator can tell a contributed rule from a shipped
  one. A seam whose rules are indistinguishable from built-ins would still leave
  the refusal unattributable, which is the gap the seam exists to close.

**How the always-on gates report and fail.** Three details of the gates that now
honour per-rule toggles:

- **The git-publish gate fails CLOSED on an unresolvable tag.** A floor tag naming
  no catalog row is a maintenance error, not a policy choice, and the two must not
  share a code path: skipping an unknown tag would turn a renamed rule id into a
  silent *allow* of a protected-branch push. An unresolvable tag therefore denies,
  logs at ERROR, and reports under the ungated row. The structural test in
  `test_push_branch_gate.py` still catches the drift at build time; this is the
  behaviour if that guard is ever removed.
- **The refusal names the rule ID; SEL keeps the pattern.** A gated git-publish
  denial leads with the rule id and carries the regex on its note line. The
  dashboard's RecoveryCard fills its chip verbatim from the first line, so leading
  with a ~70-character regex would make the most frequent denial an agent user
  hits unreadable, while the id is both short and the identity of the toggle that
  turns it off. The SEL event still records the pattern, which is what maps an
  event to a catalog row.
- **A regex spanning two rows attributes each match to its own row.** The nc/ncat
  reverse-shell regex covers two rules; denying while *either* was enabled meant
  switching `reverse-shell-nc` off left plain `nc` blocked by its sibling. Each
  match is now attributed to the row it belongs to (longest discriminator first,
  so `ncat` is never read as `nc`), and every match is examined, so a leading
  disabled spelling cannot shadow a trailing enforced one.
- **One shape earns one tag.** An all-branches flag suppresses the bare /
  single-argument fallback: with `--all` the absence of a refspec is not the
  "which branch is this?" shape, since the flag already names the target set
  exhaustively. Tagging both meant `push --all origin` also carried the
  single-argument tag, so disabling mirror-all left the command blocked by its
  sibling — enabled-and-off with enforcement unchanged.
- **The unbounded path is gated on backtracking cost, not just correctness.** A
  single-fragment pattern gets full-input matching (no 2000-char cap) *only* if
  `_polynomial_backtracking_prone` clears it. `_redos_prone` screens the
  EXPONENTIAL family at publication; it deliberately passes the POLYNOMIAL one
  (`a+a+$`, `\w+\d+$`, `.*.*!`), which is harmless on a capped window and not
  harmless off it — measured, `a+a+$` against 2,000 characters takes ~3.5s, 4,000
  ~27s, 8,000 ~228s, inside the synchronous PreToolUse gate. A flagged pattern is
  still enforced, on the bounded engine it already had; the predicate is NOT
  folded into `is_safe_user_regex` because refusing such patterns outright would
  drop rules that work today, and a rule silently not published is the defect
  this module fights rather than a fix for it.
- **One context snapshot per tool call.** The gate reads `current_context()` once
  and reuses it for both the always-on structural checks and the rule-catalog
  checks. Two reads let a live ceiling refresh land between them and judge one
  call half under each policy state. The direction that makes it matter: the
  structural IMDS/exfil checks are the only ones that catch an ENCODED address
  (`credential-exfil-imds-any` exists because the curl/wget patterns match a
  literal dotted quad), so a governance pin arriving after that point could never
  reach the encoded form — and honouring a pin late is not honouring it.

**Push-option spellings the target parser must not misread.** `git push` accepts
the repository as a flag *value* (`--repo=<x>` / `--repo <x>`), and both spellings
begin with `-`. A naive "strip the flags, the first positional is the remote" read
therefore treats the only remaining token as the remote, so `git push --repo=origin
main` classifies as the single-arg shape rather than the protected-branch one.
`--branches` is likewise git's own modern alias for `--all` (2.44+). Both were
harmless while the whole floor was unconditional — the misclassified shape was
denied anyway — and became bypasses the moment the rules were individually
disableable, since switching off the rule a shape is misattributed to publishes it.

**Abbreviations are resolved the way git resolves them.** Git accepts any
unambiguous PREFIX of a long option, so `--mirr` is `--mirror` and `--rep=origin`
is `--repo=origin`. Matching flag literals exactly therefore missed every
abbreviation, with the same misclassification consequence. The classifier now tests
whether a token is `--` plus a prefix of an option it cares about
(`_push_option_matches`), rather than comparing against a list of spellings — a
spelling list can only ever trail the next abbreviation. It deliberately does NOT
carry git's full option table: testing the prefix against only the dangerous
options is equivalent to resolving against every option and then intersecting,
because a non-dangerous option can only add a candidate and never remove a
dangerous one. That equivalence is asserted over every prefix of every `git push`
long option, so it is a checked property rather than a comment. A consequence worth
stating: an ambiguous abbreviation reads as dangerous (`--a` matches `all`), which
is free, since git refuses an ambiguous abbreviation itself and the command never
runs; a fully-spelled unrelated flag such as `--atomic` is unaffected, being a
prefix of nothing dangerous.

**Option arity is modelled, and a mis-parse can only over-protect.** Only `--repo`
had its separated value consumed, so every other value-taking push option
(`-o`/`--push-option`, `--receive-pack`, `--exec`) leaked its value into the
positional list, where it was read as a remote or refspec. The consequence was not
a misclassification but an ERASURE: for `--repo=origin --push-option ci.skip` the
leaked `ci.skip` became the sole "refspec", it normalizes to a non-protected name,
and the tag set came back empty — which is an ALLOW, since the tag set drives the
protected-branch decision. The scan now carries an explicit arity table
(`_PUSH_VALUE_OPTS`, resolved through `_push_option_matches` so abbreviations keep
working) whose separated values are consumed, and a no-value table
(`_PUSH_NO_VALUE_OPTS` plus the structural `--no-*` rule and the short-option
bundles) vouching that a neighbour token is positional. Anything else — a future
git option, an unmodelled arity such as `--recurse-submodules`'s — hits the
**fail-protective fallback**: the positional split is not trusted, BOTH
no-refspec rows are emitted — the bare tag, plus the single-arg tag whenever
positionals are visible, since an untrusted split cannot distinguish option
values from a remote and disabling whichever single row the fallback happened
to pick was demonstrated as a bypass three times in review (suppressed only
when an all-branches flag already covers a superset) — and EVERY positional is
scanned as a refspec
candidate so an actual protected name still reports its precise catalog row. A
token with an attached `=` value never disturbs the split, whatever the option, so
it is skipped as before; a bare `--` ends option parsing exactly as git reads it.
The invariant this buys: an unrecognised option can change the answer only toward
MORE protection, so the erasure class cannot silently reopen when git grows a new
value-taking option. The same fallback covers word FRAGMENTS: the scan tokenizes
on whitespace while the shell fuses a quoted or escape-continued span into one
word, so a value like `--push-option='ci skip'` arrives as fragments whose tail
would read as a refspec. `_push_token_shell_read` (one shared walk serving both
the fragment and operator-piece signals) walks the shell's own
quote/escape state over each raw token — backslash escapes outside quotes, inside
double quotes, and inside `$'...'` ANSI-C strings, but is literal inside plain
single quotes — and any token whose state does not return to normal (an open
quote, or a trailing escape that consumed the separator) poisons the positional
split the same protective way. An ESCAPED quote is data, not a delimiter: a
character-count/parity test was bypassed by `\"` in review, which is why the walk
tracks state rather than counting. Complete words keep their precise reading in
both directions — `"feat\"x"` is not flagged, and the quote-splice `'ma'\''in'`
still reads as exactly the protected-branch row. The `$`-lookback for ANSI-C can
misread `$$'` (PID expansion) as ANSI-C, which only ever OVER-flags, never the
reverse. Word-PRODUCING syntax is handled before the split assigns slots at all:
a `$` anywhere in any token — or a token-LEADING `~`, which is env-driven text
rather than path syntax (bare `~` IS `$HOME`, and `HOME=refs/heads` turns
`~/main` into a protected refspec; a mid-word `~` stays literal data) — lands
the segment on the ungated branch (parameter
expansion word-splits AFTER this scan — `V='ci.skip main'; git push --repo=origin
--push-option $V` hands git a `main` refspec the split never saw — and this slot
must not be weaker than the refspec slot's existing `$` posture), while glob
characters (`*` `?` `[`) and extglob patterns (`@(` `+(` `!(`) in any token keep
the wildcard-refspec identity, since
pathname expansion can produce words and none of those characters is legal in a
refname. Shell OPERATORS are consumed by the shell, never by git, so they are
handled before any argv-level reading (and before `--`, which is git's
end-of-options, not the shell's): a `#`-opened comment truncates the segment's
remaining tokens; a redirection token is excluded with the shell's own arity (an
attached target — `2>err`, `2>&1` — is self-contained, a bare operator consumes
the next word), which keeps `git push origin feature-x 2>&1` allowed while
`git push origin </dev/null` reads as the precise remote-only shape instead of
scanning a phantom refspec; a bare `&` (a single ampersand is not a segment
separator upstream, only `&&` is) or operator glue mid-word marks the split
untrusted AND scans the operator-delimited pieces, so a protected name cannot
hide behind glue — except that a word glued to a WELL-FORMED redirection
(`origin>/dev/null`, `main>log`) decomposes precisely instead: the pre-operator
word stays positional and the redirection is consumed, because bash reads it
exactly that way and the fallback's bare tag was the WRONG catalog identity for
a remote-only push (an identity miss is itself a hazard under per-rule
opt-out). Redirection arity also recognises bash NAMED descriptors
(`{name}>...` is all redirection — read as a word, the `{name}` became a
phantom refspec erasing every tag) and quoted TARGETS (`>'log'` — the operator
grammar admits no quotes, so a quote can only sit in the target group;
refusing the whole token for it had mislabelled the shape), while fragment
tokens (open quote state) still poison the split protectively. Quoted operator characters are data and none of this fires. A segment
whose CUMULATIVE quote/escape state is still open at its end continues into the
next line — bash line continuation (`\<newline>` vanishes) and quoted newlines
splice words across the newline segment boundary, so `origin ma\` + newline +
`in` pushes `main` while no scanned token spells it — and lands on the ungated
sentinel (the `ma$in` posture); a mid-segment open whose quote closes before
segment end stays on the disableable fallback, because in-segment joining can
only fuse whitespace into a word (never a valid refname) and the pieces stay
visible to the superset scan. The invariant
has two different strengths, stated honestly: the OPTION-ARITY axis fails
protective by construction (an unrecognised option lands in the fallback), while
the SHELL-SYNTAX axis rests on the metacharacter inventory being complete — a
construct the scan does not know parses as an ordinary word — so that inventory
is pinned as a checked property
(`test_every_bash_metacharacter_is_accounted_for` maps every bash metacharacter
to the layer that accounts for it: upstream separators, upstream
substitution/expansion ungating, the `$`/glob pre-checks, redirection/comment
consumption, the fragment walk, or a documented benign rationale). (Note the
earlier retraction of a 35-entry option table on
the dangerous-PREFIX axis is not precedent against these tables: prefix matching
is a set intersection where extra names are inert, while arity decides which
tokens are refspecs at all, so a table here does change outcomes.)

**Opt-out state — keystone `denied_commands.json`.** The opt-out state is a
security ceiling, so it lives in its OWN keystone file
`~/.kiro/crew/denied_commands.json` (respecting `KIROCREW_HOME`) — NOT in the
agent-readable `config.json`. The file's root IS the opt-out object:

```json
{
  "disable_all": false,
  "disabled_ids": ["<builtin-rule-id>", ...],
  "user_added": [{"id": "user-xxxxxxxx", "pattern": "rm -rf /tmp/mine", "enabled": true,
                  "note": "use a scoped path instead"}]
}
```

`note` is optional operator prose, surfaced in the refusal when that rule fires so
the caller reads remediation instead of a raw regex. It is metadata: it never
participates in matching. Create-only, mirroring `pattern` — neither has an edit
endpoint. Two constraints follow from the refusal being a parsed micro-format
(see "Refusal string" below): the add endpoint collapses whitespace and rejects a
note containing `DENY_REASON_PREFIX` (`note_forges_reason`), and
`hooks.resolve_denied_notes` drops any note that still carries the prefix, which
is the guard that holds for a keystone file edited by hand.

The file is on `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` (read+write block) AND the governance
boot-integrity `required` tuple, so the agent can neither READ nor WRITE its own
deny ceiling via any shell form — it inherits the mature `is_sensitive_path`
gate (variable-indirection, symlinks, `KIROCREW_HOME`, interpreters, casefold,
realpath), at the same protection level as `security_policy.json`. This is why
NO bespoke bash write-matcher is needed (an earlier config.json-based approach
plus such a matcher was removed: a matcher over shell text can never be provably
complete, and the keystone floor closes the whole class).

- **Read (boot / cron):** `hooks_config_from_config_dict` parses the flat hook
  keys from config.json's `hooks` section, then OVERLAYS the opt-out state from
  `load_denied_commands_state()` (the keystone file). config.json's
  `hooks.denied_commands`, if any, is IGNORED — the keystone file is the sole
  source. Parsed into `HooksConfig` as `denied_commands_disable_all` /
  `denied_commands_disabled_ids` / `denied_commands_user_added` (list of
  `UserDeniedPattern`). Missing file / keys → the safe "nothing disabled" state
  (fail-safe for a deny gate).
- **Write (dashboard):** the 6 `/api/security/…` mutations run
  `_write_denied_state` — an atomic read-modify-write of `denied_commands.json`
  under the shared config lock, routed through
  `atomic_write(restrict_to_owner=True)`. The lockdown lands on the temp file
  before any content reaches it, so the keystone never exists in a
  world-readable file: 0o600 on POSIX, owner-only DACL on Windows. On a
  lockdown failure `atomic_write` raises by default (the same fail-loud
  contract the other keystone writers in `apps/builtins/*` use for their
  `policy_store.py` and `secrets.py`), so a transient lockdown failure cannot
  leave the ceiling under the inherited parent DACL.
  `_reload_live_hooks` splices the new opt-out fields onto the live
  `HookManager` (preserving its flat hook keys) so the change enforces without
  a restart. These operator endpoints open the file directly and do NOT route
  through the agent tool gate.

`HooksConfig.from_dict` remains **fully defensive** against malformed values
(type-checks every field; booleans — `disable_all`, the auto-approve flags, a
user rule's `enabled` — go through `_coerce_bool`, since `bool("false")` is
truthy in Python; unknown junk fails safe: `disable_all` → `False`, `enabled` →
`True`). The snapshot/handler read helpers apply the same normalization
(`disabled_ids` filtered to non-empty strings so a malformed `[{}]` can't raise
`TypeError: unhashable type`).

(config.json itself keeps its pre-existing write-only protection
`_WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS` for its *resource-ceiling* fields, unrelated to the
opt-out state which no longer lives there.)

**Settings → Security UI** — the panel edits this state: a disable-all toggle,
per-rule toggles grouped by category, and an add-your-own field for custom
patterns. Built-ins are disableable but not deletable; weakening a rule requires
confirmation and is SEL-audited. Governance-pinned rules render locked. The
git-publish category has eight rules, but only
`git-publish-push-brace-expansion-refspec` is floor-enforced and locked; the other
git-publish predicates consult the effective enabled set.
`floor_enforced_builtin_command_ids()` exposes that explicit ungated set for the
display/API guard. Disabling a locked id returns 409 `floor_enforced`; re-enabling
is a no-op success. The disable-all control remains available when governance pins
exist because `compute_effective_denied` force-re-adds only pinned rules.

**Live reload (no restart)** — a mutation hot-reloads the running
`HookManager` via `_reload_live_hooks` so the PreToolUse gate reflects the new
opt-out state immediately. The **heartbeat**-scoped manager
(`slack.gateway._build_heartbeat_hooks`, which drops the user's
`auto_approve_tools` so `HEARTBEAT_SAFE_TOOLS` is the sole approval authority) is
rebuilt **per heartbeat run** from the current primary manager — not snapshotted
once at init — so a just-disabled built-in or just-added user deny reaches
unattended heartbeat sessions without a gateway restart (cross-surface
consistency).

**Defense-in-depth nuance** — some rules overlap an independent
keystone control, and it matters which of those controls the rule's own toggle
now reaches:

- **Still always-on, opt-out cannot touch it:** `is_sensitive_path` on every
  resolved path the file tools open, and the OS sandbox's bind-mask of the
  credential stores; no catalog row stands between a shell command and
  `~/.aws/credentials`, so there is nothing there to opt out of.
- **Now gated by the rule's own toggle:** the IMDS gate (`_check_imds_access`,
  keyed to `credential-exfil-imds-any`) and the bash exfiltration branches
  (`audit_bash_exfiltration`, each branch keyed to the catalog rule(s) it
  implements). These used to fire regardless of opt-out state. They are still
  default-ON — the toggle is opt-*out* — but an operator who disables the rule
  now disables the branch with it, which is the point: a rule advertised as
  disableable that stayed enforced anyway was a lie the Settings panel told.
- **Split:** the `git-publish` rules. The floor is still their *only* enforcement
  (their ReDoS-prone patterns never reach the regex tier), but the floor now
  consults the enabled set, so disabling one allows exactly the command shape it
  covers. The exception is `git-publish-push-brace-expansion-refspec`, whose
  coverage is an ungated anti-obfuscation branch; it is the one git-publish rule
  the Settings surface still locks (see the Protected-branch gate bullet above).

Rules without an independent keystone control (AWS mutations, infrastructure
teardown, local deletion, database deletion, process termination, and reverse
shells) are fully unblocked when their catalog rule is disabled.

**Governance enterprise force-pin** — the Level-1 `security_policy.json`
`commands`-scope deny patterns are the enterprise force-deny. `hooks.py` reads
them via `_governance_pinned_command_ids(ctx)` (backed by
`governance.resolve_pinned_commands`) and unions them into the effective set, so
a pin overrides user opt-out via tightest-wins. Because `security_policy.json`
is on the `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` keystone (the agent cannot write it), a pin is
un-opt-out-able by construction. See `governance.md`.

A **Level-2 profile** can also pin a `commands`-scope rule. Two accessors keep
enforcement and display correctly scoped:

- `pinned_builtin_command_ids()` (ENFORCEMENT) — the **active ceiling only**.
  The hooks gate force-re-adds these ids (tightest-wins) so a user opt-out can't
  weaken a *ceiling* pin. It deliberately does NOT union other profiles' pins: a
  rule pinned only for profile A must not be force-enforced for profile B or a
  no-profile session. Per-*profile* command enforcement is handled separately by
  the gate's `_governance_denial` commands-scope deny plane, which resolves the
  *bound* profile.
- `pinned_builtin_command_ids_for_snapshot()` (DISPLAY) — the ceiling pins
  **unioned with the pins from all loaded profiles**
  (`governance_profiles.all_profile_pinned_commands()`). Used by the
  surface-agnostic Settings > Security snapshot (and the builtin-toggle 409
  check) so a rule pinned by *any* profile renders locked and rejects a disable,
  never surfacing as a no-op opt-out (UI success while the bound-profile gate
  still denies). This is display-only and does not widen enforcement.

**Read-only auto-approve** — now that kiro-cli's `autoAllowReadonly` is retired,
`hooks.on_tool_call` auto-approves read-only tool calls itself, as the **last**
branch before `allow()` — after every early-return deny (deny-by-default shell,
sensitive-path, sensitive-bash, exfil, write-protected-config, effective deny
set, governance). Position guarantees a read-only classification can never
re-admit anything the deny/governance gates blocked. For a shell tool it
auto-approves only when `command` is present and
`security.readonly_bash.is_read_only_bash(command)` is True (deny-by-default: rejects
output redirects, substitution, and backgrounding; input redirects/comments are
refused for the position- or mode-sensitive verbs where a shell-elided word can
change the verdict). Help/version syntax does not create read-only authority:
the command must already match the explicit read-only command table, otherwise it
falls through to human approval. A non-shell tool is auto-approved when
`tool_kind in {"read", "fetch"}` or `slack.gateway._is_read_only_tool(tool_name)`
is True. Both classifiers are imported function-locally to avoid an import cycle.

Computer-use observation tools get their own **explicit** pair in that same
branch (`_cu_read_only_auto_approve`), keyed on the code-owned
`governance.computer_use_action_classes()` table rather than the
`_is_read_only_tool` title heuristic — that heuristic keys on a leading verb, and
an agent-supplied title must never decide whether a keystroke is synthesized into
somebody's window. It is additionally gated on the keystone primary enable, so no
auto-approval can exist while the feature is off. There is **no**
`computer_use.approval` ordinal and no approval-floor clamp helper: that row was
removed with the rest of the computer-use governance model, so nothing makes the
feature observation-only; see [governance.md](governance.md).

**The semantic `tool_kind` is an ALLOW-list, evaluated before ANY title-keyed
fast-path.** Only `tool_kind in _READ_ONLY_TOOL_KINDS` (`read`/`fetch`) auto-approves
outright; **every other non-empty kind returns `allow`** — i.e. falls through to
interactive approval — before the computer-use check or `_is_read_only_tool` is
consulted. A title-keyed branch is reachable only when the kind is **absent**.

**The computer-use auto-approve additionally requires an EXPLICIT read-only kind** —
it is reached only *under* that allow-list branch, never on an absent kind. Two
agent-controlled inputs meet there and neither may decide alone: the title, and the
absence of a kind (indistinguishable from an honest omission). They must agree.

Three findings shaped this, and all are worth keeping in view:

1. `tool_name` is the display title, and `select_tool_title` (`acp/_dispatch.py`)
   prefers the LLM-authored `description`, so it is **agent-controlled** — as
   `on_tool_call`'s own docstring states. The computer-use branch originally sat
   *above* any kind test, so once the operator enabled computer use, a mutating call
   titled `mcp__kirocrew-computer__computer_get_state` skipped the prompt entirely
   (verified for all six mutating kinds).
2. The first fix was a **denylist** (`kind in _WRITE_TOOL_KINDS` → `allow`), and it
   was still fail-open: `tool_kind` is passed through verbatim from the ACP `kind`
   field, so it is an arbitrary agent-influenced string and no enumeration of
   mutating kinds can be complete. `kind="other"` is a real ACP value and sailed
   past it. Hence the inversion — deny-by-default on the kind.
3. The allow-list still let an **omitted** kind through to the computer-use branch,
   so a `computer_click` could forge an observation title, send no kind, and
   auto-approve. Fixed by demanding the explicit kind. Deliberately *not* fixed by
   blocking absent kinds outright: the generic `_is_read_only_tool` fallback rejects
   every `mcp__kirocrew-computer__*` title anyway (asserted by a test, so it cannot
   quietly start matching), so a blanket block would have regressed every ordinary
   tool's "reads don't nag" behaviour for no security gain.

`_WRITE_TOOL_KINDS` survives as documentation of which kinds have been observed to
mutate; **the gate must not branch on it again**. Over-blocking here costs one
approval prompt, under-blocking costs the prompt that is the last thing between an
injected agent and a click. Pinned by
`test_hooks.py::TestMutatingKindBeatsTheTitle`, which asserts the unknown-kind cases
behaviourally AND asserts over the AST that `on_tool_call` references no
mutating-kind denylist.

### Inert mentions of a permission verb (`security/argv_floor.py`)

The catalog's `chmod`/`chown` rows are `re.search` patterns over the whole command
text. A regex over text cannot tell a verb that RUNS from the same word handed to a
search tool as a pattern, so an ordinary audit of those very rules was refused —
`grep -nE 'chmod|chown|/etc/' src/` denied, while preventing nothing, since the same
search completes by spelling the verb another way.

`argv_floor._perm_verb_mention_only` supplies the question the regex cannot ask: **is
every occurrence of the verb an ARGUMENT of a command that treats arguments as data?**
It is argv-structural, not textual — it reuses the frame walk, `_argv_programs` and the
data-consumer primitives the self-protection floor already relies on. `is_denied`
consults it only for the patterns the catalog opts in
(`denied_rules._PERM_VERB_MENTION_PATTERNS`, derived from the catalog by a verb-anchored
selector so a renamed or added row stays covered).

**A re-spelled verb is judged by position, not by its spelling.** The per-token gates
key on the verb as a WORD, and a shell does not need the word: `ch""mod`, `ch'mod'`,
`"ch"mod`, `ch\mod` and `ch$()mod` all execute it, and the normalized deny view the
pattern is matched against de-quotes them back to it. So the walk's TRIGGER is widened
rather than gated beside — a token that only de-quotes to the verb
(`argv_floor._deglues_to_perm_verb`, pre-filtered on the characters that permit a
de-glue at all) enters the same per-token loop as one that spells it. That is what
covers the pass-through wrappers: `command`, `env`, `exec`, `nohup`, `time`, `nice`,
`sudo`, `xargs` and `find -exec` each leave the verb at an ARGUMENT position, where the
frame's program is the wrapper and no wrapper is an accepted data consumer, so they are
refused by the gate that already exists instead of by a hand-kept wrapper list. Each of
those spellings was measured taking a scratch file from `0o600` to `0o777` while the
command as a whole was admitted.

**Fail-closed is the whole posture.** Every gate in the walk is a REFUSAL, so a
construct the walk cannot read keeps the deny. Concretely it refuses: any frame that
RUNS a permission verb in program position, including nested payloads, asked through
`_shell_tokens` — the tokenizer the normalized deny views are themselves built on, so
where that reading and the walk's own argv disagree the deny follows the text the
pattern matched; any frame whose PROGRAM cannot be resolved, because a glob (`ch?od`)
or a surviving expansion (`${x}chmod`) names a command the filesystem or the
environment decides and no de-glue can see; a frame that fails to tokenize; a redirect
other than `/dev/null` or a file-descriptor duplication; a newline; a control operator
GLUED inside a word, because `_argv_programs` opens a new frame only between whole
tokens and a program after a glued operator is therefore invisible to every other gate;
a command whose input is over `_PERM_VERB_MENTION_MAX_CHARS`; and any downstream
pipeline stage that is not itself an accepted data consumer.

**The accepted set is subtractive.** `_PERM_VERB_MENTION_PROGRAMS` is
`_DATA_CONSUMER_PROGRAMS` minus `_PERM_VERB_MENTION_EXCLUDED_PROGRAMS`, so a consumer
added to the shared vocabulary is inherited here and a mistake in the exclusion list
costs a false positive rather than a bypass. Three reasons put a program on the
exclusion list: it MUTATES the filesystem (`cp`, `mv`, `tee`, and the permission verbs
themselves, which must never exonerate their own mention), it EMITS its argument as
output (`echo`, `printf`, so a redirect turns the mention into a script on disk), or it
SPAWNS a helper named by an option or script operand (`rg --pre`, `less +'!cmd'`,
`awk` `system()`, `sed` `e`, `sort --compress-program`). Membership is pinned by a test
whose failure message names the exclusion list as the place to decide.

Two accepted programs — `uniq` and `xxd` — write their SECOND operand. They are judged
on operand count per command (`_writes_a_second_operand`) rather than excluded, because
the exemption's commonest shape pipes into them with no operand at all
(`… | uniq | head`) and writes nothing, while `xxd <verb> /usr/local/bin/git` truncates
a protected path with no verb in program position at all.

Operand counting reaches an operand sink only. A program that names its sink with an
OPTION is excluded outright instead — macOS `base64 -o out_file` and `yq -i` both write
a path named by a flag, and an option allow-list would fail OPEN on the flag nobody
enumerated. `jq` stays exempt: it has no in-place flag.

The narrowing records its own SEL `mechanism` value, `_PERM_VERB_MENTION`, distinct
from the glob carve-out map's `_DENY_EXCEPTIONS`; the two share one emitter and nothing
else, and the audit trail exists to answer which one allowed a command.

### Sanctioned read channels over fenced data

The identity-store fence (`identity_stores.py::IDENTITY_STORE_ROOTS`, spliced into
`security/paths.py::_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`) is a coarse, verb-independent path matcher, and
that coarseness is deliberate. Some legitimate work still needs data it covers or guards:
an agent diagnosing the runtime it drives needs that runtime's protocol logs. The answer is
a **channel** — one reviewed code path with its own declared source list — never a
carve-out on the matcher. `kiro_cli_logs` (`mcp_tools/logs.py`, backed by
`diagnostics.read_kiro_cli_logs`) is the worked example. Any further channel, including a
read-only inventory of the governance trust root, is held to the same three clauses.

**1. Scope is a declared source list, and the test is conversation content.** A channel
enumerates its own sources and never widens `security/paths.py::is_sensitive_path`. Sharing
alone is not the disqualifier, and that is this clause's sharpest edge: `mcp.log` and
`lsp.log` have the same single-fixed-path, all-sessions-interleaved shape as
`kiro-chat.log`, so payload content is the only thing separating them. What disqualifies a
source is carrying **conversation content** not attributable to the calling session.
`kiro-chat.log` and the `sessions/cli/<sid>.jsonl` transcripts both do, and clause 2's
redaction is a credential pass that does not narrow prose, so no amount of scrubbing makes
them readable here. The protocol logs explain a rejected turn without carrying the
conversation, so `read_kiro_cli_logs` reads those and names neither of the other two.

That content property belongs to a component this repository neither builds nor pins, so a
channel carries a **fail-closed tripwire** rather than a standing assumption.
`diagnostics._looks_like_protocol_frames` refuses a source WHOLE and visibly once its text
reads as serialized frames, so a kiro-cli that starts logging bodies produces a refusal
instead of a silent widening, and `_begin_at_event_boundary` closes the matching bypass
where a truncated window strands a frame's argument lines after its envelope was cut away.
Neither tries to separate one session's frames from another's, deliberately: a per-line
filter over interleaved sessions would look scoped without being scoped, which is worse
than nothing.

**2. Redaction is reuse of one entry point, and its order is load-bearing.** A channel calls
`diagnostics._scrub` rather than assembling the passes itself, because the assembly carries
a constraint that is easy to lose: `validation.strip_hidden_unicode` runs FIRST, then
`security/exfil.py::redact_exfiltration_urls`, then
`security/redaction.py::redact_credentials`, then the collector's `_EXTRA_REDACTIONS` for
the bearer / `Authorization` / `mc_token` shapes those miss. Stripping hidden characters
afterwards is worse than not stripping at all: `redact_credentials` matches a secret's
literal shape, so an invisible planted inside one defeats it, and a later strip — every MCP
response leaves through `validation.build_tool_response` and its `sanitize_response` —
rejoins it into a live credential that redaction has already been asked about and declined.
The guarantee is what those passes cover: credential and exfiltration-URL **shapes**. It
does not narrow prose and cannot say whose data a line is, so it cannot satisfy clause 1.

**3. Ownership splits along that seam.** The redaction guarantee belongs to the shared
redaction modules and their tests, not to the channel calling them — a channel inherits
their coverage, and inherits every later improvement to it. The source list and the
tripwire belong to the channel module, where they are read together with the tool's
advertised description, and are signed off on the pull request that introduces the channel.
Caller identity is the third piece: an operator-triggered diagnostics bundle may read wider
than an agent-callable tool, because the human who runs it is the caller and is entitled to
that gateway's data. `diagnostics.collect_bundle` does read `kiro-chat.log`; the
agent-callable tool does not. That asymmetry is the rule holding, not an inconsistency to
reconcile, and it also decides where a control lives: the orphaned-line discard sits in the
agent-facing reader rather than in the byte-tailing helper the bundle shares, because it
discards data and only the cross-session boundary justifies that loss.

So a new channel arrives with four things stated: its source list, the content property
that keeps those sources in scope, the tripwire that fails closed when the property drifts,
and who its caller is. A channel whose source carries conversation content it cannot
attribute to the caller does not ship narrower — it does not ship.

### Computer use: a pixel/AX surface the path matchers cannot see

Native desktop GUI automation ([computer-use.md](computer-use.md)) is a security
surface unlike every other one in this module, and the difference is worth stating
plainly: **`is_sensitive_path` cannot see it.** A click has no path, a keystroke
has no command body, and a window's pixels have no filename. So none of the
mature matchers in this document apply — not the sensitive-dir regex, not the
relative-traversal block, not the symlink resolution, not the write-protected
tier. A Terminal window rendering `~/.aws/credentials` is, to the path gate, no
different from a text editor.

Three controls carry the weight instead:

1. **The app denylist is a floor in code** (`computer_use/policy.py::_DENIED_BUNDLE_PREFIXES`),
   matching by bundle-id PREFIX (so a helper process under a blocked bundle is
   covered) or case-insensitive process-name SUBSTRING (the Windows/Linux drivers
   may only ever learn a process name). Five categories: `terminal`,
   `credential_manager`, `system_settings`, `auth_prompt`, `kirocrew_self`.
   **`terminal` is refused for ALL verbs, reads included** — for two independent
   and individually sufficient reasons: a terminal window renders whatever the
   operator last `cat`ted as both AX text and pixels (and redaction only catches
   shapes it knows — it will not recognise an SSH private-key body or an opaque
   bearer token), and a keystroke into a shell prompt IS arbitrary command
   execution that never passes `hooks.on_tool_call`, bypassing the entire
   denied-command ceiling, the sensitive-path gate and the SEL audit of bash
   calls. `kirocrew_self` is there because Kiro Crew's own dashboard can flip this
   feature's primary enable and the denied-command opt-out — controls that are
   out-of-band precisely so the agent cannot reach them. The list is
   operator-EXTENSIBLE (`extra_denied_apps` can only ADD) and never
   operator-shrinkable. There is no enterprise force-pin on top: the
   `computer_use.apps` ruleset was removed with the rest of that model, so
   `PolicyConfig.from_state` reads only `allowed_apps` / `extra_denied_apps` and the
   shipped entry plus the operator's own additions are the whole list.
2. **The secure-SUBROLE check**, and it must be the subrole. A real macOS password
   box reports `AXRole = "AXTextField"` (innocuous) with
   `AXSubrole = "AXSecureTextField"` and a **readable** `AXValue` — live-verified.
   So the intuitive `AXRole == "AXSecureTextField"` check **misses every password
   field**. The driver sets `secure = (role == SECURE_SUBROLE or subrole ==
   SECURE_SUBROLE)` and three protections key off that one flag: the renderer
   emits `<secure>` for the value (never the bytes, not truncated, not
   masked-with-a-hint), `policy.check_input_target` refuses
   `set_value`/`type_text`/`press_key` at a secure target, and a window containing
   ANY secure node gets **no screenshot at all** (whole-window suppression — there
   is no reliable way to blank a sub-rectangle of an already-encoded JPEG, and a
   partial redaction that missed would be worse than none). This floor has **no
   policy key and none will be added**: `resolve(None, None, …)` permits
   everything on an ungoverned host, so anything expressed only as a governance
   scope leaks by default for every single-user install. It belongs with
   `_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS` and the AKIA redaction, not with governance.
3. **The input-text scan as an explicit SECOND layer**, not the primary control.
   Text bound for another app's window is run through `is_sensitive_bash_command` →
   `audit_bash_exfiltration` → `is_denied` (called with `denied_regexes=None`, so
   it fails closed to the full built-in rule set — a user's opt-out from a bash
   deny rule is a decision about commands the AGENT runs under the tool gate, not
   a licence to type the same command into somebody else's window). This module
   already records the maintainers' position that chasing shell-parser
   completeness in a text matcher is a losing game, which is exactly why "refuse
   the app wholesale" comes first.

**Accepted residual — the screenshot directory stays agent-readable.** Persisted
JPEGs live in `<tmp>/kirocrew-computer-shots`, created `mode=0o700` with each file
passed through `platform_compat.restrict_to_owner` and ring-trimmed to 200 — but
the agent can still reach them with `fs_read`. This is the same posture browse
already ships; computer use widens WHAT can be in the frame (any window, not one
browser tab), which is bounded by per-window capture only (never full-screen) and
the whole-window suppression above. The design does not widen the posture and
does not claim to close it. A reviewer will find this independently, so it is
recorded here rather than left implicit.

Two further boundaries this module does **not** cover, stated so nobody assumes
otherwise: shell GUI automation (`osascript`, `cliclick`, `xdotool`,
`screencapture`, …) is a `commands`-scope item governed by the deny floor, never
re-parsed into GUI sub-effects; and the **web terminal PTY**
(`dashboard/handlers/terminal.py`) contains no `is_denied` /
`is_sensitive_bash_command` / governance call at all, so it is an operator-only,
ungoverned plane today.

### Suspicious Bash Patterns (`security/`)

Patterns in `SUSPICIOUS_BASH_PATTERNS` are checked by the advisory
`audit_bash_command()` history scan; they are not the PreToolUse deny gate.
Patterns with `*` use `fnmatch` glob matching; others use substring matching.

**Deletion patterns**: `find * -delete`, `find * -exec rm`, `find * -exec shred`, `xargs rm`, `git clean -f`, `shred `, `truncate `, `rm -rf /`, `rm -rf ~`

**Exfiltration patterns**: `curl * -d @`, `curl -d @`, `curl * --data @`, `curl --data @`, `curl * -F file=@`, `curl -F file=@`, `wget --post-file`, `nc * < `

**Pipe execution**: `| bash`, `| sh`, `| python`, `| perl`

### SEL Forward Callback (`sel.py`)

`set_forward_callback()` enables centralized log integration (basin/ktap). Events are redacted via `redact()` before forwarding to strip credentials and exfiltration URLs from string fields. Callback failures are logged at debug level (never silently swallowed).

### Credential File Permissions

`load_credentials()` in `loader.py` enforces `chmod 600` on `~/.kiro/crew/.env` at load time. If permissions are too open (group/other readable), they are tightened automatically. If `chmod` fails (e.g., file owned by another user), a warning is logged.

### Observe Mode Context Isolation

`channel_history.push` in observe-mode channels is gated on `_user_authorized`. Only messages from the owner or allowlisted users are recorded in the history buffer. This prevents non-owner messages from influencing LLM context via prompt injection through shared channel traffic.

### Slack Thread-Context XPIA Screening and Boundary Neutralization

When a new session starts inside an existing Slack thread, the handler fetches the thread-root message (`thread_parent_text`) and/or thread metadata (`thread_meta`) via `conversations.history` / `conversations.replies`. This content can be authored by **any** user — anyone who can post in a thread the bot participates in, not just the owner — so it is untrusted (XPIA) input. Beyond the existing `redact()` pass (credential/exfil stripping), the turn assembly now does the following. Thread-parent screening and framing live in `context_assembly/turn.py::thread_context_parts`, reached from `ContextBuilder.build_message`, which screens and scrubs `thread_meta` itself in `context.py`:

- Screens both `thread_parent_text` and `thread_meta` with `security.contains_injection()` (a public wrapper over the shared `_INJECTION_PATTERNS` set, which lives in the dependency-free `vector_memory_constants` module and is re-exported by `vector_memory`) and **drops** the content on match; the parent branch then degrades to the bare thread-metadata block so the LLM still knows it is in a thread. The wrapper imports the pattern set at module top level and does **not** fail open — a screen that cannot run must not silently pass untrusted content through.
- Frames surviving parent text as **`[SLACK THREAD CONTEXT — UNTRUSTED DATA]`** wrapped in `<<<UNTRUSTED_THREAD_PARENT … >>>END_UNTRUSTED_THREAD_PARENT` delimiters, explicitly instructing the model to treat it as content to read and never as instructions to follow — instead of the prior "started by a prior session … here is what was posted" framing that presented it as trusted output.
- Before framing, neutralizes Unicode-normalized variants of every untrusted fence marker (the thread-parent, calendar-event and todo-text fences, open and close) through the shared span matcher; on that normalized view each underscore position in a marker matches one run of whitespace, underscore or hyphen, possibly empty, and the matcher stays linear because no two optional classes are adjacent (NFKC, complete Default-Ignorable-Code-Point removal, and original-coordinate replacement), then neutralizes every primary structural prompt marker. Surviving `thread_meta` receives the same structural-marker scrub before it is placed ahead of the current-request boundary. Genuine wrapper markers are minted only after the untrusted payload has been scrubbed.
- Emits a `prompt_injection_dropped` SEL audit event (`security.audit_injection_dropped()`, best-effort) whenever screened thread-parent or thread-metadata content is dropped, so attempted injection via shared thread surfaces stays visible in the audit trail.

### Mermaid Diagram Sandboxing

Mermaid `securityLevel` is set to `'strict'` in `components/markdown/MermaidBlock.tsx`, rendering diagrams inside an iframe sandbox. This prevents JavaScript execution from prompt-injected Mermaid diagram payloads.

### MCP Input/Output Validation (`validation.py`)

Centralized validation for the registered MCP tool handlers (`MCP_CORE_SCHEMAS` and `MCP_CRON_SCHEMAS`):

- **Type-safe schemas**: `FieldSpec` + `ToolSchema` declarative validation
- **Unicode normalization**: NFC normalization + hidden character stripping (control chars, format chars, surrogates — preserves `\n`, `\r`, `\t`). Private-use code points are deliberately kept: Nerd Font and terminal-theme icon glyphs live there and are visible to a reader, so they cannot hide a credential from one.
- **Allow-lists**: enum enforcement for lesson categories, cron schedule kinds
- **Regex patterns**: agent name, job ID format validation
- **Range checks**: positive numbers for timeouts/intervals, valid timestamps
- **Length limits**: tool names (64), short strings (500), medium (5K), long (50K)
- **Unknown field rejection**: rejects unexpected fields in tool inputs
- **Response truncation**: 100K char limit prevents DoS from unbounded tool output
- **JSON-RPC 2.0 envelope validation**: request + response structure

### Foreign-Agent Import Boundary

Foreign-agent import treats every discovered file and database as untrusted
local input. Source ids are validated against the engine's registry (the shipped
foreign agents plus any an edition registers); Quick and unknown source ids are
not accepted. The
category catalog is likewise fixed to sessions, memories/preferences,
workspaces, MCP servers, user-authored skills, compatible schedules, and the
strict settings allowlist.

OpenClaw current discovery is restricted to `~/.openclaw` or normalized
`~/.openclaw-<OPENCLAW_PROFILE>` state, its JSON5 `openclaw.json`, and the
explicit `OPENCLAW_STATE_DIR`/`OPENCLAW_HOME`/`OPENCLAW_CONFIG_PATH`/
`OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE_DIR` overrides. The `"default"` profile means unprofiled
state. Only the documented `.clawdbot` legacy root with `clawdbot.json` or
`openclaw.json` is retained. `.moltbot`, implicit `openclaw.json5`,
`config.json`, root `mcp.json`, top-level sessions, and guessed root databases
are not scanned.

`GET /api/onboarding/import/scan`, `POST /api/onboarding/import/apply`, and
`PUT /api/onboarding/import/state` all require normal dashboard
authentication. Apply revalidates source/category selection and current
filesystem state instead of trusting scan output or client-supplied paths.

Security invariants:

- **No secret movement:** credentials, tokens, cookies, literal MCP environment
  values/headers, security policy, governance profiles, admission/deny state,
  and other secret-bearing records are reported by category/reason only and are
  never returned as values or copied.
- **No executable authority:** hooks, native agents/personas, raw
  instructions/system prompts, tool transcripts, approval state, provider
  sessions, and runtime/security state are never imported.
- **Constrained projections:** sessions keep visible user/assistant text only;
  memory goes through native writers/limits; workspaces must resolve to valid
  existing non-sensitive directories; MCP requires exactly one secret-free
  stdio/HTTP transport and cannot replace managed servers; skills are
  user-authored, source-namespaced, traversal-safe, and symlink-safe; schedules
  are rejected whole when foreign execution, routing, repetition, provider, or
  security semantics cannot be preserved, semantically deduplicated, and
  created disabled; settings use a strict non-security allowlist and preserve
  existing values.
- **Bounded databases:** before a supported foreign SQLite store is opened, its
  main file and present `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars must be regular non-symlink files
  whose aggregate size is at most 64 MiB. Unsupported durable stores, including
  Hermes `memory_store.db`, are diagnosed without opening them. A lineage store's
  active memory rows are capped across both supported tables before either
  contributes import candidates.
- **Merge-only and idempotent:** existing Kiro Crew data wins. A provenance
  ledger prevents replayed source items from creating duplicates and carries no
  grant of trust or permission.
- **Read-only source:** scan/apply never rewrite, move, delete, chmod, or
  otherwise mutate a foreign source tree. Unsupported, malformed, secret, or
  over-limit entries are skipped and reported rather than coerced. Malformed
  JSONL invalidates the complete file and any workspace provenance collected
  from its prefix. Symlinks and Windows reparse points/junctions are rejected at
  source traversal and destination skill ancestry boundaries.

Import is not a governance bypass. Every imported artifact is still subject to
the destination's ordinary security checks and to the effective
`POLICY ∩ PROFILE` ceiling; imported data cannot weaken either level.

### Dashboard Authentication & Authorization

**Run controls are ownership-scoped for every internal caller.** The per-run spawn
routes (`steer`, `release`, `status`, `retry`, `delete`, `continue`) and the run
list admit an `internal_auth` caller only to runs it owns: the run's originating
session (`parent_session_key == X-Session-Key`) or the run itself
(`subagent:<id>`). The check runs whatever memory store the caller's identity
resolved to -- a verified Global-memory session is still only the owner of its own
runs -- and a caller that presented NO `X-Session-Key` owns no run a session
started; it reaches only a run with no parent (the host operator's own CLI run).
A refusal is 404 `task_scope_denied`, so a run id is never confirmed to a caller
that may not see it; the identity-less refusal says so and points at the
strict-identity diagnosis (`kirocrew doctor`), because from the caller's side a
wrong run id and a missing identity are the same "not found". Only the dashboard
owner (cookie auth, no `internal_auth`) is admitted without the fence: that
surface IS the owner. `handlers/messaging.py::_run_belongs_to_caller` is the one
predicate both the routes and the list use.

**An untrusted channel sender talks to a tool-less agent.** A messaging turn the
channel does not trust as its operator (`ChannelTurn.deny_all_tools`) is driven on
`dispatch.TOOLLESS_TURN_AGENT` (`kirocrew-guest`: `tools: []`, no MCP servers, own prompt), in a
session of its own, because a tool the operator's agent auto-approves through
`allowedTools` raises no permission request on the kiro backend and so no
permission-time refusal can reach it. Details: [messaging](messaging.md).

**Dashboard URL config** — single `dashboard.url` field in `config.json` (e.g. `http://my-host.example.com:8080`). Hostname, port, local-only mode, and allowed origins are all derived from this URL. When not set, defaults to `localhost:5476`. `KIROCREW_PORT` env var overrides the port (dev mode).

**SSH tunnel instructions** — All SSH tunnel commands printed by `kirocrew gateway` and `kirocrew doctor` now use the `-N` flag (`ssh -NL ...`) to suppress remote shell allocation. The tunnel purely forwards the port without opening an interactive session on the remote host.

**Local-only resolution** (`origin.py:is_local_only()`):
- No Slack → always local-only (no auth layer available)
- Loopback host in URL (localhost, 127.0.0.1, kirocrew.localhost) → local-only (`127.0.0.1`)
- Non-loopback host or auto-detect on remote machine → all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`)

**Token authentication** (`token_auth.py`):
- HMAC-SHA256 signed tokens with dual expiry: 5-minute link click window (`exp`) + session TTL up to 20 hours (`session_exp`)
- `!dashboard` and `/kirocrew dashboard` available to owner and allowed users; link always sent via DM (never in channel)
- First use: validates `exp` (5-min window), binds IP, marks consumed, sets `mc_token_{port}` cookie with `max_age` from `session_exp`
- Subsequent requests: validates `session_exp` via cookie
- `parse_duration()` caps at 20 hours max (MAX_SESSION_TTL_SECS = 72000)
- Loopback is not exempt: gated requests require a token in both bind modes; internal CLI/MCP callers authenticate via loopback + the `X-Internal-Secret` local secret
- `token_auth_middleware(local_only)` — single boolean controls all auth behavior
- **Secure cookie flag via `origin.is_https_request()`**: the `mc_token_<port>` cookie (and the refresh cookie) set `Secure` only when the request is HTTPS — `is_https_request(request)` returns True for a direct HTTPS request, or when `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` is present **and the immediate peer is loopback** (a TLS-terminating tunnel/proxy forwarding into the loopback-bound gateway). Plain-HTTP localhost must NOT set `Secure` or the browser refuses to send the cookie back

**Internal MCP authentication denial codes** — an internal tool can receive the same
`403 Forbidden` body for several different failures. `token_auth.py` therefore labels
the actionable internal paths without changing what they deny: `unix_peer_unverified`
means the Unix-socket peer could not be confirmed as the gateway user;
`peer_session_mismatch` means the verified peer belongs to a different session than
its declared `X-Session-Key`; `caller_record_missing` means the current cron or
subagent registry record no longer exists. `mcp_core._http_error_body` maps those
codes to the matching recovery step: restart the gateway and recreate the session,
restart or replace the mismatched session, or start a new session, respectively. The
existing `internal_auth_mismatch` mapping remains the wrong-instance diagnostic.
Unknown codes and uncoded `Forbidden` responses keep the backend wording, so a real
permission denial is never relabelled as an identity failure. Every branch keeps its
existing HTTP status, deny decision, ordering, and SEL audit.

Subagent caller lookup uses the original run record when present. If it is
absent after eviction or gateway restart, exactly one active, non-queued run
whose `conversation_key` matches the canonical `subagent:<original-id>` can
establish that caller. App attribution and record-existence checks use the same
resolver; a surviving original record retains its ownership precedence. Missing,
ambiguous or unreadable records remain refused, and completed continuation
records alone cannot establish the caller. This in-memory lookup does not read
persisted run metadata to authenticate a live caller. The captured execution
record supplies member/store routing separately.

**Per-session logout (CWE-613)** (`token_auth.py`): the access cookie is a self-contained HMAC-signed token, so clearing it client-side (`Set-Cookie max_age=0`) does not stop a saved copy replaying until its `session_exp` (up to 20h). `RevokedNonceStore` is a persisted denylist of explicitly-revoked access-cookie nonces (`token_revoked_nonces.json`, mode `0600`, survives gateway restart; each entry stores the token's own `session_exp` as an eviction floor so the file cannot grow unbounded). `POST /api/auth/logout` → `revoke_access_cookie()` validates the token, then records its nonce; `validate_token` (cookie path) is **deny-by-default** — a token whose nonce is revoked, or that carries no nonce at all, is rejected. Link-click token exchange also mints a SEPARATE session cookie (fresh nonce, `register_nonce=False`) rather than reusing the one-time URL/link token as the long-lived cookie, and denylists the consumed link nonce so a captured link copy cannot be replayed as `mc_token_<port>` (the query-param LINK path does not consult the denylist, so legitimate re-navigation of the same link URL within the 5-minute window still re-exchanges for a fresh session cookie).

**Structured monitor API authorization** (`dashboard/handlers/autonudge.py`):
browser `GET/POST/PATCH` monitor routes expose durable provider observations and
can replace, restart, or stop the one record bound to a session. They therefore
require `is_owner_dashboard_request` before resolving a caller-selected slot or
monitor id or parsing a body. This closes the gap where an allowed Slack user can
receive a valid dashboard cookie but is not the operator who owns every local
session. Stale bootstrap subjects receive the shared re-authentication response;
other denials carry `dashboard_owner_required`. The agent-facing
`GET /api/autonudge/session-monitor` is instead a strict-internal route: both the
authentication middleware and the handler require the internal-secret trust
marker before the supplied `X-Session-Key` is resolved, with no browser-cookie
fallback. Allow and deny decisions are best-effort SEL audited with operation and
coarse reason only.
Legacy AutoNudge reads return a structured record REDUCED to what a caller with
no owner gate is entitled to -- presence, cadence, liveness and state, with the
monitor record itself plus `message` (which on a structured monitor holds the wake
instructions), `banner` and the sentinel path all withheld -- so the full record
stays readable only through the owner-gated monitor routes. Structured WebSocket
state is sent only to the owner-authorized client set. If a structured id is
presented to the legacy DELETE route, that route applies the same owner gate
before delegating to the monitor stop authorizer.

**Pull-request provider authorization and audit** (`dashboard/handlers/source_providers.py` + `dashboard/source_providers/`): every full-source read, checks read, review-thread mutation, and background sidebar refresh may inherit host `gh`/`glab` credentials. Which instance those credentials may reach is not browser-controlled: `github.com` and `gitlab.com` are always accepted, and a self-managed GitLab host is accepted only when its exact `host[:port]` appears in the operator's deny-by-default `dashboard.gitlab_hosts` allowlist. Adding an entry is an explicit operator decision to let the local `glab` CLI reach that host, including one only resolvable on the internal network; the allowlist is matched exactly (no suffixes, wildcards, or `www.` stripping), malformed entries are dropped at config load rather than sanitized, and `_run_json` re-checks the host before spawn so a code path that skipped URL validation is denied instead of reaching an unauthorized instance. A self-managed target additionally loses `GITLAB_TOKEN` from the provider child environment: the variable is a single ambient credential with no host binding, so forwarding it alongside a redirected `GITLAB_HOST` would disclose a gitlab.com PAT, and every permission it carries, to the self-managed server. Those hosts authenticate from their own per-host entry in glab's config. Direct source APIs require the explicit empty `request["app"]` dashboard claim. With a configured `DashboardState.owner_id`, reads and mutations require exact equality with `request["user"]`. With no configured owner, the signed machine-local bootstrap subjects `local-app` and `local-startup` are the owner for reads and mutations alike, which is the standalone-local case. Machine-local startup and local-secret token issuance use the configured owner id as their subject when one exists, so the auto-opened dashboard and `kirocrew token` satisfy the same exact owner check. Missing claims, non-owners, app tokens, and unrelated local subjects fail closed with 403. Every direct API attempt makes a best-effort SEL access record with only the caller, operation, and coarse reason. URL, thread id, provider text, and credentials are omitted. SEL write failure cannot weaken an authorization denial or replace the request's response or exception. Cancellation during request-body parsing or provider work is recorded as `failed/request_cancelled` when SEL is available, then the original cancellation is re-raised.

`_run_json()` emits credential-free SEL tool-invocation lifecycle events around every provider CLI attempt. Provider executable resolution records `executable_not_found` when no candidate exists and `executable_untrusted` when an override or found candidate fails provenance validation. Unsupported providers, invalid bounds, Windows sandbox absence, untrusted executables, and sandbox rejection record `denied`. An allowlisted command awaits its synchronous critical `invoked` append on a worker thread immediately before spawn, so an audit filesystem failure denies execution rather than launching a credential-bearing process unaudited, without blocking the gateway event loop. Cancellation while that worker is active remains fail-closed and waits for it to settle; if `invoked` landed, cleanup records `failed/request_cancelled` before re-raising and never spawns the provider. Provider launchers run in a dedicated process group, and timeout, output-overflow, and cancellation cleanup kills and reaps the complete launcher/provider tree so a sandbox wrapper cannot leave `gh` or `glab` orphaned on an unread pipe. Successful JSON decoding records `completed`; spawn, output, timeout, nonzero exit, decode, cancellation, and internal errors record `failed` with only a coarse reason. Audit records contain the logical provider (`gh`/`glab`), not argv, URL, repo path, output, environment, token, thread id, or exception text. Terminal audit failures are best effort and never alter an already-completed provider result.

The `gh`, `glab`, and `az` operator override names are owned by
`github_runner.PROVIDER_CLI_OVERRIDE_ENV`; dashboard and monitor callers consume
that one roster rather than maintaining parallel maps.

**Structured GitHub monitor provider boundary**
(`monitoring/github_pull_request.py`): background pull-request shadow probes are a
separate monitor-owned consumer of the shared synchronous `github_runner`, not of the
dashboard handler. The target gate accepts only exact public `github.com` HTTPS
pull-request identities and normalizes `www.github.com`; it refuses arbitrary and
enterprise hosts, credentials/ports, repository-only paths, suffixes, queries,
fragments, raw control characters, URL parameters, non-canonical numeric aliases,
oversized pull-request numbers, and invalid owner/repository segments before resolving `gh`. Every
provider call uses the runner's validated absolute executable, minimal GitHub-only
environment, audit-or-deny invocation record, strict UTF-8 decoding, and
`pin_host="github.com"`; no monitor-specific token source or credential storage
exists.

Raw stdout, stderr, response envelopes, URLs, timestamps, cursor/request ids, bodies,
comments, and logs never cross the adapter boundary into monitor state, exceptions,
or logging. Canonical state is an explicit small allowlist; check labels are stripped
of controls and URLs, passed through `security.redact()`, and bounded in length and
count before persistence. Provider failures
are reduced in memory to fixed error kinds and reason codes, including a non-retryable
setup kind for missing, untrusted, or unexecutable `gh`; raw diagnostic text is then
discarded. Every read is a GraphQL document that carries one alias per subject, and no
part of a subject reaches the document text: aliases and variable names are built from a
subject's index in the batch, while owner, repository, number, and cursor travel as typed
GraphQL variables, so a hostile repository name is a value the server binds rather than
syntax the adapter emits. The load-bearing primary read selects no check rollup; checks
are read in a separate document with the head revision, so a missing Checks permission or
a push between requests produces typed incomplete supplemental evidence without erasing
authorized primary facts. The rollup read compares the head it is given against both the
primary read's revision and the commit the rollup itself describes, and a mismatch on
either is typed incomplete evidence rather than another commit's checks. Open-PR
review-thread pagination is bounded to ten 100-node pages and the check rollup to four
100-node pages, each subject advancing on its own cursor; both ignore outdated threads and
preserve usable nodes from partial GraphQL errors; incomplete or capped evidence fails
closed as pending. A terminal merged/closed
primary state does not issue either supplemental request. A partial failure degrades only
the subjects it covers: `gh` exits non-zero whenever a response carries any error, including
one scoped to a single alias, so the exit code is evidence about that alias and decides the
outcome only when no payload can be read instead; an error naming no alias in the batch is
charged to every subject in it rather than dropped. Shadow execution has no dispatcher
dependency and refuses an enabled wake request before either provider or persistence
work, so it cannot turn ambient GitHub authority into a model wake in this slice.
Locally imposed check and review-thread caps remain durable incomplete evidence and do
not consume the provider-error budget; transport failures and malformed provider
pagination remain typed supplemental errors.

The provider adapter's redaction is classified as inbound canonicalization rather
than an egress surface. The structured monitor controller is the corresponding
registered redaction sink: it passes the complete bounded wake envelope through the
exfiltration-URL and credential scanners before injecting it into an agent session.

**Additional structured source-provider boundaries**
(`monitoring/gitlab_merge_request.py`, `azure_devops_pull_request.py`, and
`bitbucket_pull_request.py`): all adapters emit the same exact bounded canonical
pull-request facts and stable error taxonomy. Before any supported provider target
is persisted, `monitoring/targets.py` applies the shared credential scanner to its
canonical URL and rejects credential-shaped path text rather than storing or later
surfacing a redaction marker. This is an inbound gate, not an egress sink. GitLab
accepts `gitlab.com` plus
only exact operator-configured self-managed hosts and rechecks that allowlist on
each probe; self-managed calls carry an explicit empty `GITLAB_TOKEN` scrub
sentinel through environment construction so the shared minimal-environment
builder cannot reintroduce the ambient token. GitHub, GitLab,
and Azure execute only validated absolute `gh`/`glab`/`az` binaries with minimal
provider-scoped environments. GitLab and Azure monitor probes always require the
protected canonical system-owned policy because their child processes receive
provider credentials; an agent-replaceable same-user Homebrew or user-local binary
cannot receive those credentials. GitHub retains its established same-user resolver,
and operators can opt every shared provider CLI into protected resolution with
`KIROCREW_PROVIDER_BIN_STRICT=1`. The shared CLI transport
strips ambient SSH and
language-runtime injection variables (including Python, virtualenv, Conda, and
Node search paths), replaces inherited `PATH` with the platform's trusted system
path when one exists, and routes the validated argv through
`sandboxed_spawn_argv(mode="standard")` from the filesystem root. The sandbox's
general environment scrub runs first; the transport then restores only credentials
explicitly scoped to that provider invocation. It drains stdout/stderr concurrently
into fixed byte ceilings. Crossing a ceiling terminates and reaps the sandboxed
process tree instead of buffering or orphaning the remainder. Process exit and both
pipe joins retain independent finite deadlines, including after a timeout or a
descendant that inherited a pipe. Each probe loads one credential snapshot with
environment propagation disabled and threads that mapping through its supplemental
reads; a read-only monitor therefore cannot widen the gateway's ambient environment
or race another `os.environ.copy()`. GitLab's
ambient-token decision is the same shared
host-policy predicate used by the dashboard source panel, so self-managed hosts
cannot drift onto the gitlab.com-token path. The transport also enforces fixed
timeouts, disabled Azure extension dynamic installation, a shared four-probe
concurrency ceiling, and credential-free lifecycle audit records. Azure accepts only
`dev.azure.com`; its optional `AZURE_DEVOPS_EXT_PAT` is loaded from the protected
credential file and is denied to agent subprocesses. Bitbucket accepts only
`bitbucket.org` targets and constructs requests under the fixed
`api.bitbucket.org/2.0` root; responses are size- and timeout-bounded. Optional
`BITBUCKET_EMAIL` and `BITBUCKET_API_TOKEN` credentials are used only to build the
HTTPS Authorization header and are never placed in argv, monitor state, logs, or
browser payloads. Azure DevOps Server and Bitbucket Data Center URLs fail before
credentials or network access.

The controller passes credential authority through the provider protocol on every
probe. Each monitor persists its descriptive creation surface (`dashboard`,
`channel`, or fail-closed `unknown`) separately from its storage binding. The surface
does not grant credentials: the dashboard mutation boundary reserves an exact loop id
and prepares a pending grant in the sandbox-hidden encrypted-vault directory before
persistence, then activates that grant only after the monitor commit. Updates rebind
the grant to the exact provider kind and target, and deletion or replacement revokes
it. Revocation first persists the id in a separate protected tombstone record and
only then removes the active grant. A failed grant cleanup therefore remains denied
after restart; an unreadable or malformed tombstone record denies all grants. A
failed tombstone write also places the id on an immediate process-local deny set, and
the removal is refused before the agent-writable row disappears. Later credential
checks retry until the durable denial lands. A later authenticated prepare or rebind
clears its id only after the replacement identity is protected. A generic AutoNudge
removal cancels and quiesces its timer before awaiting the durable denial, restoring
the active timer if that denial fails, so the off-loop trust write opens no fire window.
It snapshots whether the exact row held a provider grant before revocation; if the
subsequent monitor-store write fails, rollback restores that exact grant with the
durable row before re-arming its timer.
A generic AutoNudge replacement must revoke a displaced structured monitor before
committing the new agent-writable row; if that combined snapshot fails, it restores the
exact prior provider grant before re-arming the restored monitor. When a target update's revocation
cannot become durable, the controller uses compare-and-swap to restore the prior monitor
identity before it returns failure, so a restart cannot expose a stale grant under an
attacker-selected target. The failed update captures that prior snapshot under the same
service lock that applies its patch, preserving any concurrent update that committed
first instead of rolling the monitor back past it.
Restart first durably revokes the exact displaced provider grant before the
replacement snapshot can commit; a failed snapshot restores that grant while the
prior row is still current. Credential-activation rollback then restores the grant
only after the displaced terminal row is durable again and only while the exact
replacement snapshot remains current. A concurrent monitor patch wins and the
failed restart reports a conflict instead of overwriting that committed edit. Any
later best-effort trust cleanup is therefore redundant rather than the security
boundary.
The controller requires an exact active grant before giving Azure or Bitbucket a gateway-owner
credential snapshot, so an agent-written monitor record cannot forge dashboard
authority. GitHub and GitLab explicitly retain the established authenticated `gh` and
host-authorized `glab` behavior. That exception is an allowlist, so an added provider
gets no channel access to gateway-owner credentials by default. Channel-bound Azure probes record a
credential-free `denied` SEL event and return authorization failure before reading
the credential store or Azure CLI state. Channel-bound Bitbucket probes never read
the credential store and use anonymous HTTPS, which limits them to public targets.

Pod environments scrub the loader's complete credential roster, including the
Azure DevOps and Bitbucket source-provider credentials, before an isolated gateway
or arbitrary `pod exec` command can inherit it. The only roster exceptions are
`KIRO_API_KEY`, which the pod's agent needs for model access, and
`KIROCREW_OWNER_ID`, which identifies the pod dashboard owner rather than an
external service identity.

Every provider head revision is either absent or bounded hexadecimal text before
canonicalization, persistence, or prompt construction. Azure target parsing
accepts canonical `%20` escapes in project and repository segments while keeping
path separators, queries, fragments, and noncanonical encodings denied. The
fixed-argv Azure provider process explicitly receives and exposes only its resolved
`AZURE_CONFIG_DIR` and `AZURE_EXTENSION_DIR` (defaulting beneath the gateway user's
`~/.azure`) through
the otherwise-standard sandbox, so the documented `az login` credential store
works without making those directories visible to agent subprocesses. Outside a
pod, both paths must resolve at or beneath the protected canonical `HOME/.azure`
tree; a relocated `KIROCREW_HOME` is not an alternate credential root. A pod accepts
only paths beneath its disposable `KIROCREW_HOME`, where startup has scrubbed the
provider credentials. Relative, escaping, and symlinked-out overrides fail before
the sandbox receives a visibility exception. The minimal
network environment includes HTTP(S), SOCKS/`ALL_PROXY`, and the standard requests,
curl, and SSL certificate-bundle variables needed by provider CLIs behind corporate
proxies, without forwarding unrelated gateway credentials.
Pods override `GH_CONFIG_DIR`, `GLAB_CONFIG_DIR`, `AZURE_CONFIG_DIR`, and
`AZURE_EXTENSION_DIR` with roots beneath the
ephemeral pod home before any provider command runs. This keeps the live
gateway's provider logins available to its own monitor probes while preventing a
pod from inheriting the operator's persisted GitHub, GitLab, or Azure CLI identity through
the intentionally shared process `HOME`; `pod down` reclaims all of those stores.

GitHub check records with blank provider labels retain their provider-derived state
under a stable opaque identity. Azure status and policy display labels and Bitbucket build-status labels are
provider-controlled text. The adapters replace them with stable, namespaced SHA-256
identities before they enter canonical state, fingerprints, persistence, or a wake
envelope; the display labels themselves never reach an unattended agent prompt.

Sidebar status follows the same read-only boundary. `GET /api/chat/slots` and the WebSocket handshake schedule provider refreshes and opt into cached `ci`/`state` fields only for an exact configured-owner request, or for signed `local-app`/`local-startup` dashboard subjects when no owner is configured. Generic slot serialization omits those fields. `DashboardState` tracks owner-authorized WebSockets separately, sends generic slot updates to all authenticated clients, then overlays credential-backed status only to the owner subset. This prevents a cache populated by an owner request from being replayed to a non-owner or app-token caller. Review-thread cache removal, generation advancement, and stale in-flight detachment still complete after thread ownership validation and before mutation dispatch, so cancellation cannot preserve or repopulate pre-mutation data.

**Stale pre-owner sessions must re-authenticate (`stale_session_reauth`)**: a dashboard token's subject is fixed at mint time as `owner_id or <bootstrap subject>`, and both `POST /api/auth/refresh` and the one-time-link exchange re-mint from the INCOMING subject, so a session signed in before `KIROCREW_OWNER_ID` was configured carries `local-app`/`local-startup` for its whole life. Setting or changing `KIROCREW_OWNER_ID` therefore requires every pre-existing dashboard session to re-authenticate: once an owner exists, the owner gate denies the bootstrap subjects, and that denial is the control working — re-accepting them would readmit every machine-local token to an owner-locked dashboard. The operator surprise comes from `owner_id` being overloaded: it is collected as the Slack Member ID for owner DM routing, but it is also the dashboard authorization principal and the token subject, so setting it for Slack DMs also rotates the dashboard's identity anchor. To make the remedy discoverable, every owner-gate deny site that fronts the shared owner predicate (`stale_owner_session_response` in `source_providers.py`, consulted by the chat mode/approve/worktree/followup gate, the source-provider routes, cloud provisioning, MCP-app calls, `ask_question`, the browser mutations, agent-config mutations, the AWS consent gate, and the instances federated search) labels exactly this case `401 {"code": "stale_session_reauth"}` instead of the generic `403 forbidden`, and the dashboard turns that signal into a sign-in-again banner that deliberately skips the silent-refresh path (refresh preserves the stale subject, so it can never recover this denial); direct-fetch surfaces that bypass the blessed transport (the app-sdk scoped API, the MCP-app tool relay, Mochi's approval bridge) raise the same prompt through the shared `staleOwnerSignal` detector. CHANGING an already-set owner also invalidates the previous owner's sessions, but those carry the old owner's subject — an ordinary non-owner now — so they keep the generic denial: the distinct label is only derivable for the bootstrap subjects, whose staleness is provable from the subject alone. The label is chosen strictly AFTER the deny decision — access is never granted, widened, or re-ordered — and only for an ALREADY-AUTHENTICATED dashboard-user caller whose signed subject is a bootstrap subject while an owner is configured; unsigned, invalid, app-token, and ordinary non-owner callers keep the generic denial, so the discriminator discloses nothing to an unauthenticated party.

**Memory-mutation session gate** (`dashboard/handlers/memory.py`): every dashboard route that writes durable memory — the three markdown PUTs (`/api/memory/preferences`, `/api/memory/projects`, `/api/memory/history`), the semantic write and delete, the episodic delete, the `/api/memory/settings` PUT, `/api/memory/migrate`, `/api/memory/import`, `/api/memory/promote` and `/api/memory/consolidate` — runs one shared cascade, `_memory_write_gate`: the session-recognition probe (`_recognize_session`, 400 `missing_session_key` / `unknown_session`) and then the restricted-mode check (`_is_restricted_session`, 403 `restricted_session`), in that order, with a SEL `log_api_access` deny record on every refusal. It is the only implementation — a route that inlines the pair instead is how the two halves drift apart, and the inline copies it replaced had already lost the `code` field on their 403s. The order and the pairing are the control: `_is_restricted_session` answers `False` for a key it has never seen, so a route carrying only that half admits a forged or never-established `X-Session-Key` — which on `promote` also tombstones the episodic rows it folds in, and on `migrate` and the `settings` PUT flips `memory.migrated` for the whole install. The key comes from `_read_session_key`, so both halves compare one canonical form and the audit record cannot carry an un-normalized caller. The matching GETs are read paths and are deliberately outside the gate. The gate does not replace the transport-level dashboard auth above; it is the per-session write-scope check layered behind it. The recognition half's own acceptance table lives in [learn-cron-dashboard](learn-cron-dashboard.md). The cascade tests only the CALLER; `/api/memory/consolidate` additionally resolves the TARGET named by the body's `key` (`resolve_session_memory_mode`: live slot, then persisted execution record and transcript header; a channel stem first unfolded to its live key through the session map, so the thread's privacy flag is visible) and refuses a temporary or incognito target with 403 `restricted_target_session` and a SEL deny record `restricted_target_session:<mode>` before any consolidation work starts, because that gate is where the target's live mode is authoritative -- then, when the live resolution does not refuse, reads the transcript header under `key` exactly as `HistoryConsolidator._consolidate` reads it, so a channel thread named by a stem the map cannot unfold is refused from the header a `!temporary` / `!incognito` modifier stamps rather than answered 200 for a pass the consolidator refuses. Behind the route, the consolidator's own refusal and the transcript's publication hold around every durable write (memory-skills-hooks) guard every other entry point.

**Lesson-store session authorization** (`handlers/_shared.py`, `resolve_lesson_memory_store`): a named session binding on `/api/lessons` requires either middleware-established `internal_auth is True` or the verified dashboard owner. A non-owner dashboard token or App Kit token cannot use `X-Session-Key` to read, create or delete another session's lessons. The raw `X-Internal-Secret` header grants nothing here; only authentication middleware can set the internal marker. Global/workspace lessons preserve their existing session-mode gates.

**Memory-store parameter owner gate** (`handlers/_shared.py`, `resolve_requested_memory_store`): the store-scoped memory routes — the three markdown GET/PUT pairs, the semantic GET/PUT/DELETE, the episodic list/search/DELETE, `stats`, `events`, `carve`, plus the retired, backup and restore routes — accept an optional `?store=<name>` naming the memory silo the request addresses, and **the parameter's PRESENCE is the gate.** With it ABSENT the route answers from the global store, preserving the existing dashboard default. An unverified `X-Session-Key` cannot select a named store by pointing at another session's binding; this rule includes `carve`, for both rows and counts. Agent context injection and consolidation resolve trusted session metadata separately from this HTTP contract. With it PRESENT the request explicitly selects a store and takes `require_owner_dashboard_request`, which needs the explicit dashboard-user claim `request["app"] == ""` (so an App Kit token, which does carry a `user`, is refused with everything else) and a non-empty `request["user"]` equal to the configured `owner_id`, or one of the signed machine-local bootstrap subjects while no owner is configured. **That is what makes the parameter safe, and the exclusion is POSITIVE rather than a test for "is this not an agent":** `token_auth_middleware` publishes `request["user"]` on the cookie/query-token path ONLY and never on its `X-Internal-Secret` branch, so kiro-cli, the MCP servers and subagents authenticate as the INSTALLATION and carry no identity to present at all; they fail a check for "the caller proved it is the dashboard owner" rather than being recognised and refused, which is the direction that stays correct when a new internal caller is added. Gating on presence rather than on "the requested name differs from my binding" is deliberate and not cosmetic: `?store=default` names the operator's own global memory, the single most sensitive value the parameter can carry, and a mismatch rule would wave it through for any caller that happened to be unbound. An UNDECLARED name is `404 {"code": "unknown_memory_store"}` and **never a degrade** — `memory_stores.resolve_store_path` degrades an unknown name onto the DEFAULT store, so answering it would render the operator's own preferences, semantic rows and stats under the label of a store that does not exist, and the response would look like it worked; a MALFORMED name gets the identical 404 on purpose, because distinguishing the two would report whether a given name is declared to a caller that has not passed the gate. A silo whose vector tier cannot be stood up is `503 {"code": "store_unavailable"}`, never a fall back to the global store: serving the operator's own memory under a crew's name is invisible in the response. **The store-ADMINISTRATION routes (`memory_admin.py` — the store listing, the retired listing and restore, the backup listing, backup and restore) take that owner gate UNCONDITIONALLY rather than on the parameter's presence**, because each one enumerates every silo or mutates a store, and because a route gated on presence alone becomes reachable by a non-owner simply by omitting `?store=`; the presence gate still runs underneath for the declared-name half, so the 404 rule has one implementation. There is deliberately no store-delete route, since undeclaring a store orphans or destroys a crew's whole memory. No admin response carries a filesystem path: a backup is addressed by its stamped NAME, since a path would disclose the data-home layout and, for a silo, the `memory_stores/<name>/` layout the keystone fence exists to keep out of the browser. `POST /api/memory/restore` resolves that name inside the store's own `backups/` directory with the same validate-then-re-check-after-composition pairing `memory_stores._named_store_dir` uses — a single path segment, checked on both separators and refused BEFORE the join (an absolute right-hand side would override the base), then the resolved path must be EXACTLY the composed one. That last test is IDENTITY and not containment on purpose: a containment test refuses a link that escapes the directory while accepting one that redirects inside it, which is enough to restore another store's file under this store's name. The store probe behind the listing opens each file READ-ONLY through `memory_backup`'s own URI builder (so a `?` or `#` in a data-home path cannot truncate the URI onto a different database) and resolves each path with `owned_store_path` rather than a bare `resolve_store_path`, so a read-only enumeration can neither create the file whose absence it reports nor count the operator's own memory under a silo's name. Every refusal is SEL-audited by the shared owner gate (`log_api_access`, `outcome="denied"`, `source="dashboard"`, `resources="non_owner_block"`, off-thread so a first-process SEL construction cannot stall the loop) under the route's own operation name (`memory.stores.list`, `memory.retired.list`, `memory.retired.restore`, `memory.backups.list`, `memory.backup`, `memory.restore`), and a signed pre-owner bootstrap subject is relabelled `401 stale_session_reauth` by the shared `stale_owner_session_response` path above. Each admin MUTATION additionally records its own outcome after the fact, naming the store and the object it touched, and that record can never change the outcome: the mutation has already landed, and losing an audit line is better than turning a completed restore into a 500 the operator retries. The store parameter adds authorization and removes none: every PUT/POST still runs `_memory_write_gate` first, so a store-scoped write is gated twice — the session cascade decides whether this caller may write durable memory at all, the owner gate decides whether it may explicitly select the store receiving that write. Store routing itself, and what each tier resolves to, is in [memory-skills-hooks](memory-skills-hooks.md#which-store-a-dashboard-route-reads-store).

**App-token least-privilege scope (CWE-269)** (`token_auth.py`): an app token is confined to its own app namespace + the API path prefixes the app declares in its manifest `permissions.api` allowlist; everything else is denied. `_enforce_app_scope()` is **deny-by-default** — `_app_api_allowlist()` returns an empty tuple on any failure (app not installed, manifest unreadable), confining the app to its own namespace only. Enforced at all grant points (the normal cookie/query-param flow and the cross-app `/apps/<other>/api` reverse-proxy path re-check); dashboard-user tokens (empty `app` claim) bypass the gate entirely. Denials emit a `log_api_access` SEL event (`operation="app_scope_check"`, `outcome="denied"`).

**Kiro prerequisite setup boundary (`kiro_prerequisite.py`)**: the dashboard's
status/install/login endpoints require the exact configured owner. Before an
owner exists, only the signed `local-app` and `local-startup` dashboard subjects
may use them; generic dashboard-user and app-token callers are denied and
audited. The two mutations also pass the shared Origin/Referer CSRF check. They
expose exactly three fixed verbs and accept no request-selected executable,
argv, installer URL, redirect downgrade, output path, or shell fragment.
macOS/Linux download only `https://cli.kiro.dev/install`; Windows downloads only
`https://cli.kiro.dev/install.ps1`. Every redirect and the final URL must remain
on the exact `cli.kiro.dev:443` host and expected path, with no credentials,
query, or fragment. Automatic redirect following is disabled: each `Location`
is resolved and validated before its destination request, with a three-redirect
limit. The downloader rejects oversized bodies, supports explicit HTTP(S)
proxies while bypassing `.netrc`, then requires both a release-pinned SHA-256
digest and the platform-specific official marker. An upstream installer change
therefore fails closed until Kiro Crew updates the pin. The same validated bytes
remain in memory and execute through the fixed system interpreter's standard
input, closing the validation/execution replacement window. The unsandboxed
official installer receives a system-only `PATH`. Explicit login
inherits only the allowlisted user-path, UI/device-flow, TLS, and proxy values;
passive probes receive a narrower environment that carries TLS trust and, on
hosts that need it, desktop-session IPC, while excluding ambient cloud, Slack,
SSH-agent, and application credentials. Proxy configuration (both case
spellings, since matching is exact on POSIX and HTTP stacks disagree on which
case they honour) joins only the `whoami` identity stage: a proxy-only host is
exactly where `whoami` must still reach the IdP, but a proxy URL can embed
credentials, and `--version` is the first execution of an unvalidated
candidate that needs no network — so the version stage stays proxy-free and
the exposure delta is confined to a candidate that already passed the version
gate, reaching the same resolved binary an ACP session already runs with the
full inherited environment. The one deliberate *credential* exception is Kiro CLI's
OWN model credential (`KIRO_API_KEY`, `_IDENTITY_PROBE_ENV_KEYS`), forwarded to the
`whoami` identity probe only: the CLI reports an API-key session as signed in only
when it can see that variable, so filtering it out reports a host that ACP
authenticates on as signed out. In a post-scrub Docker container the variable
lives only in the data home's `.env` (the entrypoint scrubs every
`CREDENTIAL_KEYS` entry — this one included — out of the gateway's
`/proc/<pid>/environ`), so the identity probe and the kiro-cli spawn paths read
it back from that file for exactly the one child that owns it; every other
scrubbed credential stays in-process. The exposure delta is that one probe's argv — the
credential reaches the same resolved binary the same probe already executes, in the
same standard sandbox posture, against the same real home. The `--version` probe,
which is the first execution of a candidate that has not yet answered anything,
stays credential-free. `whoami` decides identity from the CLI's exit status alone,
and that status reports which credential kind is configured rather than whether the
credential is accepted, so a stale or mistyped key reads as signed in.

Output and client-visible errors are bounded and credential/exfiltration-
redacted. Only HTTPS URLs on the exact official `app.kiro.dev` host or the
`/start` device path on `view.awsapps.com` are linkable. User-triggered
install/login records a critical `invoked` SEL event before spawn (audit failure
denies execution), followed by a best-effort terminal event. Passive
`--version`/`whoami` probes use the same paired audit lifecycle; probe events
contain only the probe kind and coarse outcome, never argv, candidate path,
output, or environment. One operation may run at a time. Filesystem candidate
and interpreter discovery runs off the asyncio event loop. Timeout,
cancellation, and gateway shutdown terminate and reap the full child tree using
`platform_compat`. A private POSIX supervisor remains the process-group leader
until all group members exit, so a pipe-holding descendant cannot outlive an
exited command leader or turn a retained PGID into a reuse hazard. The gateway
captures the supervisor source before agent sessions begin and
invokes it from memory with isolated Python; the supervisor wraps the completed
sandbox launcher as the outermost process, resolving a sandbox or cgroup
wrapper's executable to an absolute path before the supervisor's `execve`.
An agent cannot replace a mutable
supervisor file immediately before an owner-triggered operation, and the Linux
namespace launcher and supervisor never wait on each other.
Windows synchronously retains an identity-stable handle for the primary process
after spawn, and successful process completion awaits the descendant tracker
until every retained child is inactive and terminally scanned. An immediate-exit
launcher therefore cannot disappear before its helpers are anchored or report
success while a detached installer remains live. Discovery continues from every
live child, so late helpers are still terminated before the deadline. Each exact
root receives one final post-exit snapshot before tracking removes it, closing
the between-polls child spawn/parent exit race. Every Toolhelp parent-PID edge is
checked twice against
creation and exit times read from the exact root, retained-parent, and
newly-opened child handles. Genuine children created before an immediate-exit
parent remain eligible, while a child attached to a recycled root or
intermediate PID is rejected. Failure to retain the primary handle or validate
its identity, create a Toolhelp snapshot, or complete any initial or later
enumeration fails the operation closed; opened child handles are closed before
the error propagates. One deadline covers process exit, initial and terminal
discovery, and inherited output-pipe closure.

Unverified candidate version probes route through
`sandboxed_spawn_argv(..., mode="strict")` on POSIX. The outer sandbox launches
an unverified candidate through the absolute system `/usr/bin/env` entrypoint,
preventing a planted `kiro-cli` basename from selecting the provider's trusted
internal macOS delegation path. The strict wrapper additionally hides the
configured data home, `~/.kiro/crew`, `~/.kirocrew`, and all known Kiro
identity stores, so setup probes cannot read Kiro Crew state or bearer tokens.
Trust is "the CLI runs, and it has a valid login": a Kiro CLI that answers
`--version` is eligible for `whoami` and device login, regardless of install
source, owner, or fixed path. Kiro Crew is not the authority on where Kiro CLI
is installed, and Kiro CLI's own self-updater legitimately rewrites its bytes as
the user — so an install-source/owner/path/Developer-ID gate would strand real
installs (toolbox, Homebrew, winget, a self-updated `/Applications` bundle) with
no in-product recovery path, which is the concrete first-run/reauth dead end
this model removes. `whoami` reporting a valid session is what makes readiness
true; a runnable CLI never surfaces an unreachable "repair" state.

**The Kiro CLI is always executed IN PLACE, on every code path** (ACP spawn, auth
commands, `whoami` probes, `/usage`, `--list-models`) — never from a private copy.
The earlier design copied the resolved bytes into a per-call directory below the
staging parent, or into `<data-home>/run/kiro-cli-snapshots` (a sealed memfd on
Linux), and executed the copy, binding the launched process to the bytes just
resolved. That resolve-to-exec byte-binding is **removed**: Kiro CLI 2.15+ is a
multi-call binary that dispatches by exec'ing a sibling `kiro-cli-chat` resolved
relative to its own path, so a copy into a flat directory made every spawn fail
with ENOENT. The TOCTOU it closed requires an attacker who already has write
access to the user's own machine — outside this product's threat model, and not
defended against elsewhere — so the copy is not worth the breakage. Do NOT
reintroduce it. Installation still refuses a no-op (unchanged-digest) or shadowed
install so the Install button cannot silently succeed without producing a working
target.
Auth commands use `mode="standard"`; the fixed `~/.kiro/crew-auth-staging`
parent is on the shared sensitive-path floor and hidden by every agent sandbox.
Sign-in is delegated to Kiro CLI: `login --use-device-flow` runs against the
user's real home and environment with only the Kiro Crew data homes — the
configured home, `~/.kiro/crew`, `~/.kirocrew` — hidden, and the CLI writes
its own credential store where it normally keeps it. Kiro Crew stages no
credentials and copies none back, so there is no publication step, no
cross-gateway publication lock, no pre-publication identity-generation scan, no
SQLite backup-API republish, and no "identity changed during sign-in" conflict
for two racing gateways to hit. The real-home run is a subset of an accepted
surface rather than a new one: ACP launches the same resolved Kiro CLI with the
full real environment under the same standard sandbox on every agent session. A
credential-minimal temporary home remains available as an opt-in read-only mode
for callers that must never see the real `~/.aws` / `~/.ssh`: its random
per-call workspace below the staging parent receives HOME/XDG/AppData and holds
only the allowlisted `kiro-auth-token*.json` and Kiro CLI identity SQLite files,
the identity stores are hidden on top of the Kiro Crew data homes, and the
workspace is removed on every exit path — success, failure, timeout,
cancellation, or exception. A matched live identity file that cannot be captured
under the bounded regular-file rules aborts that staging path before the command
runs; it is never omitted as though absent. No production caller currently
selects the isolated mode, since the readiness probe also runs real-home.

The Kiro CLI identity database (`data.sqlite3`) is **projected, never
byte-copied**, and is therefore deliberately exempt from the
`_MAX_AUTH_STORE_FILE_BYTES` (64 MB) cap that governs every other staged
identity file. That database is the CLI's main store: identity occupies two
small tables (`auth_kv`, `migrations`), while `history` / `conversations*` hold
chat transcripts and grow without bound — a real user's store reached ~429 MB.
Byte-copying it both aborted sign-in for those users (with a message naming
neither size nor cause) and read the whole file into memory to write it straight
back out. Projection copies every table/index **DDL** plus the **rows** of the
identity tables only, so the staged file is bounded by the identity data alone
however large the source grows, and the sandboxed CLI receives no transcript
content. `state` is a mixed key/value table — a few rows describe *which*
identity is signed in (Identity Center region + start URL, CodeWhisperer
profile) and the rest is unrelated local state (telemetry ids, onboarding flags,
prompt counters) — so its rows are carried **selectively by key prefix**
(`auth.`, `api.codewhisperer.`), letting `whoami` render its full profile block
without handing the sandboxed CLI the user's telemetry identifiers. The match is
by prefix rather than an exact key list so a newly added `auth.idc.*` key is
carried automatically instead of being silently dropped; `state` itself is
optional, so an older schema without it still stages. The full schema is copied rather than just the identity tables because
`migrations` is projected with its rows: the CLI then treats the schema as
already current and runs no migration, so a store holding only identity tables
would fail with `no such table: history` on first use. Projection keeps the byte
path's defenses — reject a symlink, require a regular file, open read-only — and
creates the destination `0o600` before writing, so identity rows are never
briefly world-readable. A source that is unreadable, is not a database, or
is missing **any** required identity table fails closed and aborts staging,
rather than handing the CLI an empty store it would read as signed-out. The
all-or-nothing table check is deliberate: a future Kiro CLI that renamed one
identity table while keeping the other would satisfy an any-of check and stage a
store whose schema is present but whose identity rows are absent — silently
producing the signed-out outcome the check exists to prevent. Requiring all of
them turns a schema change into a loud abort instead. Consequently the SQLite
sidecar filenames are no longer staged: reading through SQLite already applies
any pending WAL/journal state.

The source is opened `mode=ro` **without** `immutable=1`, deliberately.
`immutable=1` would guarantee no sidecar is ever touched beside the user's live
database, but it also asserts the file cannot change, which makes SQLite **ignore
the `-wal`**: against a store in WAL mode whose newest commits are still
WAL-resident, the token row reads as missing and the staged store presents as
*signed out* — a worse failure than the size abort this projection replaces.
Plain `mode=ro` applies the WAL, so the staged identity always matches what the
CLI itself would read. The accepted cost is that SQLite may create or refresh the
`-shm` shared-memory index beside the live database exactly as any other reader
does; `-shm` carries no identity data, and no bytes are ever written back to the
user's store. A regression test pins the WAL-resident case.
Candidate discovery spans the inherited `PATH`, interpreterScripts directory, and explicit operator override on every OS — a runnable
candidate from any of these is eligible, since trust is "it runs". Status
requests never mutate `KIROCREW_KIRO_BIN`. Electron delegates entirely to this
gateway service and does not execute a second candidate or installer path. For
each local-token request Electron re-resolves the authoritative migrated or
pinned data home, reads exactly that home's one bootstrap secret, and sends it
only to the literal `127.0.0.1` gateway bind address; it never probes canonical
and legacy secrets across multiple loopback addresses. ACP launch does not
re-impose a provenance gate: the shared client/runtime resolver accepts any
runnable candidate and canonicalizes symlinks before its final no-follow open.
Every platform then launches that candidate **in place** — the resolved path
itself, never a private copy of its bytes (see the in-place launch record above:
a multi-call Kiro CLI resolves its sibling subcommand executable relative to its
own path, so a copy strands it). Explicit Kiro classification preserves
internal-sandbox delegation without relying on the executable basename. There is
deliberately **no** resolve-to-exec byte-binding and no install-source/owner
gate: arbitrary unsandboxed same-user native code is outside the enforceable
in-process boundary regardless, gating on origin only strands legitimate
self-updating installs, and a swap between resolve and exec requires local write
access this product does not defend against anywhere else. This is an operator-triggered
system prerequisite, accepts no LLM input, and is absent from the headless MCP
server route set.

**App manifest permission model — advisory (`apps/permissions.py`)**: distinct from the HTTP app-token scope above, the App Kit manifest `permissions` block (`mcpTools`, `network`, `memory`) is currently **advisory, not enforced in-process**. `validate_permissions()` and `format_permissions_summary()` exist but are **not wired into the install or runtime path** — they have no callers outside `test/`, so the manifest `permissions` block is neither enforced nor even surfaced today. `check_tool_permission()` **fails open on an empty `mcpTools` allowlist** (returns `True`) and is not called at the tool-dispatch boundary, so `mcpTools` is a review/display signal rather than a runtime capability gate. (Install-time path-traversal blocking is a separate mechanism: `_check_path_safety(name)` + `manifest.validate()` in `_validate_source_path`, not the permission validator.) Real in-process enforcement (and per-resource `owner_app` ownership) is tracked in `docs/request-for-change/rfc-app-sandbox-isolation.md`; today an installed app runs with the user's full trust, confined only by the HTTP app-token scope, the OS sandbox, the `agent.apps_allow_third_party` off-switch, and destructive-command deny patterns (TRACKING).

**Third-party app execution boundary (`apps/execution.py`)** (CSE SEC-012): admission and governance decide which apps may be installed/activated; this separate runtime boundary decides whether admitted app code may execute. `agent.apps_allow_third_party` defaults to `false`, and only the literal JSON boolean `true` is an explicit grant (truthy strings/numbers and environment variables do not admit). `app_execution_denied()` is the shared provenance/config/audit decision used before in-process module loading, backend dependency setup/adoption/spawn, lifecycle shell commands (`onEnable`/`onDisable`/`onUninstall`), registry detection/build/`onInstall` commands, and `openCommand`. `enable_app()` evaluates it before persisting `enabled=true`, so denial leaves metadata, resources, dependencies, scripts, hooks, and backends untouched; `handle_open_app` separately requires the app already be enabled. A config-load error fails closed. Positively identified shipped builtins are exempt. Every denial emits one `app_execution_admission` SEL event carrying the action and fixed provenance classification; the config/API-derived app name is deliberately omitted from that event. Self-registration cannot claim `origin=builtin`; that provenance is reserved for `register_builtin_apps()`. New repository grants store the normalized coordinate in `agent.apps_trusted_repositories`; new repository-less grants store the name in `agent.apps_trusted_local`. Both markers are inert without the matching `agent.apps_trusted` entry. Registry and installed-app APIs expose a server-overwritten `trustRepository`; the dialog displays and echoes it as consent proof, and the grant endpoint rejects missing or stale proof for repository-backed code. `install_from_registry` compares the stored binding with the freshly resolved row before any repository-controlled bytes are fetched or executed. A bound rebind returns `app_trust_repository_mismatch`; a legacy name grant with no marker is inactive for repository-backed or unknown/fresh sources and returns `app_execution_denied`, requiring one-time re-consent even when the repository is unchanged. Only a still-installed app whose provenance is positively local retains legacy migration compatibility. The trusted-apps snapshot places inactive legacy entries in `ineffective`, revoke still tears them down, and the allow-all falling-edge sweep treats them as blanket-only. Rebind coordinates and embedded credentials never enter denial prose, error responses, or audit events. Provenance-resolution failure logs use only fixed classifications: config-derived grant names and exception text do not cross that logging boundary. Installed metadata sanitizes `source`, `sourceUrl`, and `sourceRegistry` at the write boundary, and list/detail APIs repeat that stripping for legacy records. Sanitization removes HTTP(S) userinfo completely. Username-only SSH/git+ssh userinfo and scp-style `user@host:path` remain because they are transport routing; executable and governance paths reject colon-bearing SSH userinfo because Git treats it as part of that routing username, not as a removable password. **Wire identifier:** a denial that reaches the dashboard carries the stable machine-readable `code: "app_execution_denied"` alongside its advisory `error` prose — emitted by the `openCommand` route, by `install_from_registry`, and by `AppResult.to_dict()` (which serializes `error_code`) for `enable`. The frontend keys its "allow this in Settings → Security" affordance off that code, never off the prose, so the sentence stays free to be reworded; renaming the code is a breaking UI change.

**App admission gate (`apps/admission.py`)** (CWE-829): a contained App Kit admission decision core, gating the app install / update / enable / `register_external_app` / registry paths. It is **distinct** from the CPP-seam plugin admission engine (`platform/admission.py`), which gates signed plugin entry-points from `~/.kiro/crew/admission_policy.json`; this gate governs App Kit apps from a separate `config_dir()/app_admission.json`. The fleet-controlled policy carries a kill-switch (`banned`, always wins), a marketplace `approved` allowlist (non-empty = only-these), and an optional HMAC `require_signature` check (verified against a `trust_keys` secret the *policy* — never the app — holds, over `AppManifest.signing_payload()`). `app_admission_denied()` runs **before** the app's files are copied or its `onInstall` script runs, so a denied app never lands on disk or executes. **Fail-closed** on a present-but-unreadable policy (deny-all + `critical` SEL audit); an **absent** policy admits (interim default preserving today's no-policy behavior — the seeded-default mechanism that makes absence itself fail-closed belongs to the CPP governance seam). Asymmetric signing + trusted-publisher-key distribution + a per-app capability ceiling remain follow-on.

**Federated registry validation & refresh (`apps/routes.py`, `apps/registry.py`, `apps/registry_pipeline/`)**: external (federated) app registries are configured under `config.registries` (`{name, repo, branch}`) and mutated via the dashboard API. The trust-boundary contract:
- **`repo` validation** — `POST /api/apps/registries` runs every entry's `repo` through `_is_safe_repo_identifier`, which admits **either** a legacy bare name (`^[A-Za-z0-9_-]+$`, kept for companion resolution) **or** a vetted full git URL. URLs must be `https://` (`_SAFE_HTTPS_URL_RE` — plaintext `http://` is rejected, see the CWE-319 threat row) or an explicit `ssh://` remote (`_SAFE_SSH_URL_RE`, userinfo optional — both `ssh://host/path` and `ssh://user@host/path` accepted; authentication is by key via ssh config) or scp-style (`_SAFE_SCP_URL_RE`, `user@` required because a userless scp form is ambiguous with local paths); shell metacharacters, `..` traversal, and `owner/repo` shorthand are rejected. When no explicit `name` is supplied, a bare name defaults to `repo` (legacy) while a URL derives a collision-safe slug via `_derive_registry_name` (host+path slug + short sha256 of the original URL) so two distinct URLs can never share an `_external_registry_cache_path` cache file. `branch` defaults to **`main`** (was `mainline`) and is validated against `^[A-Za-z0-9][A-Za-z0-9_\-./]*$` with `..` rejected.
- **Cache-key injectivity (path traversal, CWE-22/CWE-706)** — because a `repo`/registry `name` can now be a full URL, every cache path derivation (`_safe_cache_stem`, `_external_registry_cache_path`, `_blob_cache_key`) keeps pure-safe names byte-identical (existing caches stay valid) but slugifies + appends a short sha256 for any name carrying disallowed characters — so a hostile `../../config` entry can neither escape `_manifest_cache_dir()` nor collide with another name. `_expire_cache_file` additionally re-checks resolved containment before touching any file. **The blob cache is additionally keyed on provenance, not the `repo` key alone.** `_blob_cache_key(repo, clone_url)` folds the **resolved clone URL** into the digest (`sha256(repo\x00clone_url)`), because a `repo` key is not stable provenance: registry A (private) can cache a blob under key X, be removed, and registry B later be configured reusing key X — a key derived from `repo` alone would then serve A's cached (possibly private) bytes to B. `handle_blob_proxy` resolves `clone_url` **before** the cache lookup (the SAME once-resolved URL that backs the credential decision and the clone) and threads it into the key, so a repo-key reuse across registries lands in a **distinct** cache directory (a miss + a fresh clone of B's own URL) rather than a stale-provenance cross-registry read. The `ref` also becomes a path segment in the blob cache tree (`.../{repo_key}/{ref}/{file_path}`); `_SAFE_REF_RE` permits `.` and `/`, so `handle_blob_proxy` rejects any `..` segment or a leading `/` in `ref` (`if ".." in ref or ref.startswith("/")` → 400) **before** the cache path is built — mirroring the `file_path` guard — so a crafted `ref` (e.g. `../<other-repo-key>/main`) cannot stay under the cache root while crossing into a different repo's cache directory. The resolved-path containment check still guards against any escape out of the cache root.
- **Refresh endpoint — `POST /api/apps/registries/refresh`** (optional body `{"repo": "<git-url-or-name>"}` to scope to one registry; omit to refresh all). Response contract: `{ok, refreshed, failed, results, apps, lastSyncedAt}` where `ok` is True only if every matched registry refetched successfully, and `results` carries per-registry outcome so the UI distinguishes "synced" from "sync failed, serving stale". The refetch is **fetch-then-swap**: `_fetch_and_cache_external_registry` overwrites a registry's cache only on a successful fetch, and manifest caches are expired by mtime-backdating rather than unlink, so a transient forge/network failure degrades to "slightly stale" instead of "apps vanished" (stale > missing). Malformed (non-dict) index items are defensively dropped before normalization so a registry returning e.g. `["oops"]` cannot escape as an HTTP 500.
- **Clone-host trust gate (SSRF + DNS-rebinding, CWE-918)** — a configured external registry's `app-registry.json` is **untrusted content**: it can list an app whose `repo` points at an internal address (e.g. `https://127.0.0.1:8443/x`) or any attacker-chosen host, and such a value passes `_is_safe_repo_identifier` and enters the blob-proxy allowlist. Because the App Store browse/refresh path clones automatically (icons, manifests, install), honoring that host would drive `git clone` against the loopback/internal network — an authenticated backend SSRF. `is_clone_host_trusted` (`apps/registry_pipeline/sources.py`) fails **closed** and constrains every URL clone to a **host** in the trust set = well-known public forges (`_PUBLIC_GIT_HOSTS`, plus any a companion contributes) **∪** the hosts of the owner's explicitly-configured registries (`_configured_registry_hosts`). It is enforced at the **three** clone chokepoints: `_fetch_git_blob` (blob/icon proxy, `apps/routes.py`), `_fetch_app_manifest` (manifest fetch, `apps/registry_pipeline/manifests.py`), and `_git_clone_or_pull` (the actual clone/pull, which returns the `untrusted_clone_host` error dict). Gating on the hostname — not its re-resolvable IP — makes it **rebinding-proof**; an owner-added internal forge stays allowed precisely because the owner added it, while an index-injected host never is. This is deliberately a **host-level SSRF/rebinding defense, not a supply-chain control** — anything on a trusted forge host (e.g. all of `github.com`) is cloneable, so signature/admission gating (the App Kit admission gate above) remains the second, orthogonal layer. Bare-name legacy repos have no URL host, return `False` here, and are served by the bundled-registry allowlist rather than a URL clone. Operator-visible failure mode: an install/browse against an untrusted host fails with `untrusted_clone_host` (clone path) or a silent skip + warning log (blob/manifest paths).
  - **Host-granular trust residual → credential-free clones (confused-deputy, CWE-441/CWE-668)** — the trust gate above is deliberately **host-granular**, so a host the owner configured for one registry (e.g. their internal forge) is trusted *wholesale*. Since a registry index is untrusted content, it can list an app whose `repo` points at a *sibling* private repo on that same trusted host; the host passes `is_clone_host_trusted`, and a clone that carried the gateway's **ambient git/ssh identity** would be a confused-deputy read of a private sibling repo surfaced back through the App Store. This applies on **two** paths: the **automatic** (browse/refresh-time) `_fetch_app_manifest` / `_fetch_git_blob` clones (no owner action at all), **and** the **install** clone of an app whose registry entry came from an owner-configured *external* index (the owner clicked Install on an index-authored *name/description*, but the `repo` URL behind that button is index-controlled, not typed by the owner). Mitigation on **both** paths: the clone runs **credential-free / anonymous** via `anonymous_git_env()` (`apps/registry_pipeline/subprocess_env.py`) **plus** a forced `mode="strict"` OS sandbox (`~/.ssh` hidden). The env drops the SSH agent + `GIT_SSH`/`GIT_SSH_COMMAND` passthrough (`_GIT_CREDENTIAL_ENV_KEYS`), disables system **and** global git config (`GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1` + `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL=os.devnull`, so no HTTPS credential helper fires), and forbids prompting (`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`, batch-mode `GIT_SSH_COMMAND` with no identity/agent) — so an index-injected private-sibling repo simply fails to clone (→ graceful fallback) instead of authenticating. **Provenance decides the install-path posture**: `install_from_registry` sets `index_originated = bool(entry.get("_registry"))` — external-index entries carry the `_registry` marker (stamped when the index is fetched/cached), so they clone credential-free; **bundled/curated** registry entries (no `_registry` marker) and fetching the owner's **own** configured registry index (`_fetch_external_registry_index`, whose URL the owner typed, not index-injected) remain owner-designated and keep full credentials via `minimal_env()`. `_git_clone_or_pull` takes an `index_originated` keyword that selects the env + sandbox mode for both its fresh-clone and fast-forward-pull branches. Accepted residual: installing (or previewing the icon/manifest of) a **private** app *listed in an external index* no longer works — the correct trade, since an index-controlled URL must not be cloned with the gateway's identity; the owner can still install a private app by configuring it as their own registry (an owner-typed URL). Trust remains host-granular by design; org/path-prefix scoping is a deferred tightening, but the credential-free rule removes the exfiltration lever it would otherwise carry.
    - **Same-repo credential carve-out** — exception to the credential-free rule above. When an index entry's **effective clone URL** (`_entry_git_url(entry)`) is **byte-identical** to the owner-configured `ExternalRegistryConfig.repo` (the URL the owner typed when adding the registry), the confused-deputy argument does not apply: the owner explicitly designated that exact URL, and a clone of it is no different from the credentialed index fetch the gateway already performs. `_is_owner_designated_repo` (`apps/registry_pipeline/sources.py`) implements this predicate — it looks up the configured registry by the entry's `_registry` name and compares with **exact string equality** (no URL normalization, no host-level matching; host-granular trust is precisely the confused-deputy hole this defense closes). When the predicate is True, all **three** clone chokepoints take the carve-out: `install_from_registry` flips `index_originated` to `False`, `_fetch_app_manifest` receives `owner_designated=True`, and `handle_blob_proxy` passes `owner_designated=True` into `_fetch_git_blob` (the App Store icon/screenshot proxy). Each path then uses `minimal_env()` + `_context_clone_sandbox_mode` (i.e. `standard` for a trusted SSH host, exposing `~/.ssh`), flipping **both** env AND sandbox together (the strict sandbox hiding `~/.ssh` is the load-bearing enforcement on machines with short-lived on-disk SSH certificates (e.g. an SSH CA agent), not the env alone — see the investigation appendix for the live refutation of env-only blocking). Sibling repos on the same host (a *different* URL from the config-stored one) remain anonymous+strict — the carve-out is URL-exact, not host-granular. On the blob chokepoint this URL-exactness is **structural, from a single resolution threaded into the clone, not a fetch-time re-resolution**: `handle_blob_proxy` resolves the clone URL **once** via `_entry_git_url(entry)` — the SAME resolver, over the SAME `entry` object, that the `_is_owner_designated_repo` decision is made against — and threads that one `git_url` into `_fetch_git_blob` for BOTH the credential grant and the clone. `_fetch_git_blob` re-resolves nothing from `repo`; the resolver `_registry_git_url` no longer exists. Because one read of one entry backs both the decision and the clone, `owner_designated` and the URL cloned describe the same value **by identity**, closing the TOCTOU window a second, independent re-read would open (a concurrent registry refresh swapping the entry backing `repo` between the decision and the clone, so a grant decided for one URL clones a private sibling). **Provenance-scoping (the entry selection, not just the entry).** `get_registry_app_by_repo(repo)` selects the entry by `repo` key **alone** (bundled first, then each external registry), so `_is_owner_designated_repo` — sound for the entry it is handed — could be handed registry A's owner-designated entry on a request reachable only through registry B when both publish the same `repo` key (a cross-registry confused-deputy read of A's private repo with A's credentials). The carve-out is therefore gated on **unambiguous single-owner provenance**: `_repo_key_owner_count(repo)` (`apps/routes.py`) counts the distinct configured sources publishing that `repo` key over the SAME union `known_registry_repos` admits (bundled once + each external registry once, local sync caches only, never fetching), and `owner_designated` is honored **only** when exactly one source owns the key; any ambiguity — or an unresolvable count (fails to `2`, treat-as-ambiguous) — downgrades to anonymous+strict and never grants. Ambiguity thus never escalates, so there is no separate refused-escalation branch to SEL-audit on this path — the only credential decision `_fetch_git_blob` makes is the surviving GRANT, which is SEL-audited (`_sel_credential_grant("app_blob_proxy", …)`) against the threaded `git_url` actually cloned. **The grant is also scoped to the entry's CONFIGURED branch, not an attacker-chosen `ref`.** The blob `ref` falls back to the entry's `branch` only when the query param is empty; a caller can otherwise supply any `_SAFE_REF_RE`-valid `ref` (e.g. `iconPath=logo.png&ref=private`), and deciding `owner_designated` on the entry alone would drive an owner-credentialed clone of an **unconfigured** (e.g. private) branch of the owner's repo and serve its image bytes. `handle_blob_proxy` therefore requires the effective `ref` to equal `entry.get("branch", "main")` **before** honoring `owner_designated` (the `_repo_key_owner_count` / `_is_owner_designated_repo` checks are reached only inside that branch-equality gate); a differing `ref` is **not** rejected — the anonymous+strict path still serves a public branch — it simply never attaches credentials. So credentials attach only when the resolved clone URL is byte-identical to the entry's own single-owner registry URL **and** the effective `ref` equals the entry's configured branch. **The blob path's bundled-entry posture is a deliberate conservative asymmetry, not an oversight to "fix" for parity**: a bundled entry carries no `_registry` marker, so `_is_owner_designated_repo` returns False and the blob clone stays anonymous+strict — unlike the install path, which treats a bundled/curated entry as owner-designated. Widening the blob path to match would extend a credentialed clone to the browse-time icon proxy, which runs automatically during App Store browsing with no owner action; the narrower blob posture is intentional. The practical effect: private-forge registries using the monorepo `apps/*` layout (all apps inside the registry repo itself) become fully functional — manifest fetches, installs, AND the store's icon/screenshot rendering all succeed with the owner's credentials, instead of the store listing apps correctly but degrading their icons to a blank/gradient fallback. Pinned by `TestSameRepoCredentialCarveOut` in `test/test_external_registry.py`; the blob-chokepoint posture is pinned by `TestFetchGitBlobCredentialPosture` and `TestBlobProxyOwnerDesignatedWiring` in `test/test_apps_routes_coverage.py`.
    - **Origin-mismatch move-aside + aged sweep (data-loss prevention)** — when `_git_clone_or_pull` detects an origin mismatch (`_clone_origin_matches` returns False), the stale checkout is **moved aside** (atomic same-filesystem rename to a `.stale-<uuid>` sibling inside `app-sources/`) before the fresh clone, NOT deleted. On clone **success**: the moved-aside directory is **retained** (not deleted) so the user can recover local edits; a log line names the retained path. Aged `.stale-*`/`.partial-*` directories are swept by `_sweep_stale_checkouts()` (best-effort, runs at the start of the next `install_from_registry` call) after `_STALE_CHECKOUT_RETENTION_DAYS` (7 days); the sweep targets only immediate children of `app-sources/` matching the fixed naming pattern, containment-checked via symlink resolution against the app-sources root. On clone **failure or timeout**: the moved-aside directory is **restored** to `dest` so the previous checkout survives — no local changes are permanently lost by a transient network/forge failure. If the move-aside rename itself fails (locked files on Windows), the function returns `stale_clone_not_removed` without attempting a clone — **fail-closed** preserved. The mismatched clone is never built from or pulled from under any branch of this flow. The moved-aside path stays inside the `app-sources/` root (uses `dest.with_name(...)`, never escapes the parent). Pinned by `TestOriginMismatchDeleteOrder` in `test/test_external_registry.py`.
- **Untrusted index entry-name filter (path traversal, CWE-22)** — an external registry index is untrusted input, so a hostile/typo entry `name` such as `/tmp/victim` or `../../victim` would otherwise flow through `list_registry → install_from_registry → app_source_dir(name)` (which resolves `_app_sources_dir() / name`, and an absolute or traversing name escapes the app-sources root) and, on a failed clone, reach `shutil.rmtree(dest)` on the attacker-selected path. During index normalization (`apps/registry.py`) every entry name is validated against `KEBAB_RE` (`^[a-z0-9]+(?:-[a-z0-9]+)*$`, the same kebab-case gate `install`/`register_external_app` already enforce via `AppManifest`); a non-string or non-kebab name is **dropped BEFORE it is cached or listed** so it can never reach a filesystem operation. Operator-visible failure mode: the offending entry silently vanishes from the App Store and the drop is **warning-logged only** (`Dropping external registry <reg> entry with invalid name ...`) — no install error surfaces, so an operator diagnosing a "missing app" must consult the gateway log.
- **Same-repo branch override (`_apply_configured_branch`, `apps/registry_pipeline/indexes.py`)** — a same-repo index entry's declared `branch` is index-controlled (untrusted) content and is **overridden by the operator-configured registry branch**, at fetch finalisation (with a divergence warning) and on every cache read that feeds a clone coordinate (listing, `install_from_registry` lookups, provenance candidates, blob-proxy branch resolution — so a cache written before a branch-config change cannot keep an overridden value alive). The index was cloned from exactly the configured branch, so a divergent same-repo declaration names a state that does not exist on the ref the operator asked for, and the override narrows what an index can make the installer clone (the configured value already passed the branch regex gate before the fetch). Cross-repo entries — effective clone URL differing byte-identically from the configured `repo`, the same comparison semantics as the same-repo credential carve-out — keep their declaration, since it names a ref in another repository about which the configured branch carries no information.
- **Untrusted index `subdirectory` filter (path traversal → RCE, CWE-22)** — an external index controls the entire entry, including `subdirectory`, which is joined to the throwaway manifest clone dir (`_fetch_app_manifest`), the persistent app-source dir, and the install-time app-root (`install_from_registry`). An absolute (`/etc`) or traversing (`../../victim`) value would escape those roots and let an attacker-selected `app.json` be read and its `setup.onInstall` executed with gateway privileges. Two layers close it: (1) a **lexical gate** `_is_safe_registry_subdir` (`apps/registry_pipeline/manifests.py`) — rejects non-strings, NUL, backslashes, absolute paths (POSIX/drive-letter), and any `.`/`..` segment — applied during index normalization **and** on every cache read (`_read_external_registry_cache`), so an unsafe entry is **dropped BEFORE it is cached, listed, or installed** (warning-logged only, same silent-vanish failure mode as the name filter); and (2) `_contained_join(root, subdirectory)` at each use site, which resolves symlinks and returns the joined path only if it stays within `root` — catching a hostile clone that ships a symlink (`sub -> /etc`) resolving outside the clone root at read/install time (install refuses with an explicit `unsafe subdirectory ... escapes the app source root` error; manifest fetch returns `None`).
- **Trust-grant audit (`registries.host_trust_granted` SEL event + `newlyTrustedHosts`)** — admitting a new registry host is a genuine **trust grant** (its hosts feed the clone-trust set above and its apps become installable with gateway privileges), not a mere config edit, and the generic `registries.update` event does not record *which* host gained trust — leaving an unreconstructable, one-way-door audit gap. The `PUT /api/apps/registries` handler (`apps/routes.py`) diffs the incoming hosts against the **prior on-disk** config and emits a distinct per-host SEL `registries.host_trust_granted` (`resources=host=<h> repo=<url>`) for each genuinely new host; re-saving an unchanged list — or adding a second path on an already-trusted host — emits nothing, so the audit log records exactly the trust transitions. The response returns `newlyTrustedHosts` so a client can surface the grant (e.g. a UI heads-up) without another round-trip.
- **Owner-trust snapshot reports what is SERVED, not what is granted (`build_trusted_registries_snapshot`, `dashboard/handlers/security.py`)** — the Security page's trusted-registries snapshot is built from the **effective** registry view (`_effective_registries`), the list the pipeline actually serves, rather than from the raw `config.json` rows. A config row whose name is contested by a build-pinned registry is dropped and served by **neither** claimant: it carries `served: false`, `not_served_reason: pinned_name`. Two config rows that share one identity key are BOTH served, and each row's tier is read off its OWN effective copy, so only the row whose repository is granted badges trusted. `trusted` is `_registry_trust_tier_of(effective_row) == _TRUST_OWNER`, the SAME tier function the install path computes, so the badge, the plaintext-transport refusal and the credential decision share one source of truth. Each row also carries `granted` — read straight off the keystone, independent of `served` — so the panel renders **Revoke** on any granted row and **Grant** only on a served, ungranted row. Removing a registry leaves its grant in place; a stored grant whose repository matches NO config row is listed as its own `served: false`, `not_served_reason: not_configured`, `granted: true` row so it can be revoked instead of re-arming. Grant/revoke `onError` invalidates the snapshot and maps `not_served` to the card's own copy (a `corrupt` failure adds nothing: the card's damaged-file notice already shows it). A **corrupt** keystone (bad JSON, unknown version, wrong `owner_trusted` shape, alias-backed) is surfaced as top-level `corrupt`/`corrupt_detail` with every row untrusted and ungranted, and the panel shows a notice; no product writer produces one, so there is no in-app reset — the operator fixes or deletes the file. The on-disk shape is a **version-1 JSON list** of credential-free repo URLs under `owner_trusted`; any other shape is corrupt and reads as no grants. Pinned by `test/test_registry_trust_badge.py`, `test/test_registry_trust_grant.py` and `test/test_apps_routes_coverage.py`.

**Response security headers** (`server.py:_apply_security_headers`):
- All dashboard responses receive `Cache-Control: no-store`, `Content-Security-Policy` (default-src 'self' plus curated exceptions for tailwind/jsdelivr/esm.sh, `fonts.googleapis.com` in `style-src` + `fonts.gstatic.com` in `font-src` for the dashboard's two brand webfonts, and WebSocket loopback), and `Permissions-Policy: clipboard-write=(self), clipboard-read=(self)`
- The Permissions-Policy grant is required by Chrome 143+, which changed the default policy to DENY `clipboard-write` even on secure contexts (crbug.com/414348233). Without it, `navigator.clipboard.writeText` throws a permissions-policy violation and the Copy-link button on published artifacts fails
- **`/vendor/*` CORS + Private-Network-Access grant** — sandboxed widget/artifact iframes are null-origin (srcdoc/blob) documents, i.e. NON-secure contexts, and on the default deployment the gateway is plain http on loopback, a "more-private address space" under Chrome's Private Network Access policy — so Chrome blocks the iframe's `<script src>` for the vendored Tailwind runtime unless the load goes through CORS with server approval. The live fix (issue #6181, verified against real Chromium): `widgetSrcdoc.ts` emits the runtime `<script>` with `crossorigin="anonymous"` and `_apply_security_headers` adds `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` to `/vendor/*` responses only (never any other path — the dashboard's own pages and APIs must not become cross-origin readable). `crossorigin` makes the header MANDATORY, not additive: without it the load hard-fails at the CORS layer, so every origin serving this URL must send it — the gateway is covered here, and in `npm run dev` the runtimes are served by `vite.config.ts`'s `vendorRuntimePlugin` dev middleware, which stamps the same header on exactly those files (Vite ≥6.2's own `server.cors` default is a localhost-origin allowlist that a sandboxed iframe's `Origin: null` does not match, so the upstream default cannot supply it). A dedicated `OPTIONS /vendor/{tail}` route, registered next to the per-request GET/HEAD route `/vendor/{tail}` (`_dist_file_handler`; both whether or not a build exists yet), additionally answers Chrome's PNA preflight with `Access-Control-Allow-Private-Network: true` (echoed only when the request asks; the GET route answers GET/HEAD only, so a preflight would otherwise 405 and fail closed) — forward-compat: current Chromium blocks this insecure-initiator load at the CORS layer without ever sending the preflight. `*` leaks nothing: `/vendor/` holds only public, non-secret static JS, already auth-exempt via `token_auth._BYPASS_PREFIXES`
- `frame-src` always admits loopback preview origins — http+https on `127.0.0.1`, `localhost`, `[::1]`, `0.0.0.0` (`_LOOPBACK_FRAME_SRC`) — so the chat side-panel **Web Preview** tab (`WebPreviewPanel`) can frame a local dev/static server in the packaged app, not only when the instances feature is enabled. The framed preview cannot read the dashboard's host-scoped session cookie: `WebPreviewPanel.isolatePreviewHost` rewrites a preview whose host equals the dashboard's (both loopback, incl. `*.localhost`) to a distinct loopback alias, so no `mc_token_<port>` cookie is ever sent to the previewed server. When the instances feature is additionally enabled, `frame-src` is extended with the `http://*.localhost:*` tunnel wildcard so dynamically-connected tunnel ports can be framed
- Defense-in-depth framing/sniffing/referrer/transport headers are set uniformly (all via `setdefault`): CSP `frame-ancestors` (clickjacking) — `'self'` by default plus any **exact operator-trusted origins** (never a wildcard, never a hardcoded port); `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` as a legacy backstop set **only** in the default `'self'`-only posture (omitted when an extra ancestor is trusted, since it is origin-exact and cannot express the allowlist); `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` (MIME confusion), `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin` (avoids leaking the token-bearing dashboard URL cross-origin), and `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000; includeSubDomains` (inert over the loopback HTTP bind, protects HTTPS tunnel/desktop access). Cross-port embedding of remote dashboards in the Instances viewport is enabled **only** via exact trusted-origin embedding carried in the signed token: at connect the local (embedding) gateway mints the remote token with an `embed_parent_port` claim equal to its own `KIROCREW_PORT`; that claim is carried through the link→session token exchange into the `mc_token_<port>` session cookie (`token_auth_middleware` — the exchange re-mints a fresh session token and must propagate the claim), and the middleware also stashes the validated port on the request **before** it revokes the link nonce. The embedded remote's `_extra_frame_ancestors` reads it in that order — the request-stashed value first (so the FIRST `?token=` framed document, whose link nonce the exchange revokes, still carries the origin), then the query token, then the session cookie (`token_embed_parent_port`) — and adds the parent's loopback origins (all loopback hosts at that port) to `frame-ancestors`. Exact origins only — never a wildcard, never a hardcoded port — and gated on a signed token, so a local page with no token can never inject an ancestor. Neither a loopback-wildcard nor the CSRF `allowed_origins` set is used for framing: both would let a local origin (any port, or a CORS/`dashboard.url`/dev `localhost:3000` entry) frame the authenticated dashboard and receive the `SameSite=Lax` session cookie (clickjacking, per input-validation guidance). Any request without such a token keeps the default `frame-ancestors 'self'` + `X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN` posture
- Applied via `no_cache_middleware` using `setdefault` so per-handler overrides are preserved

**CSRF protection** (`server.py` + `origin.py`):
- Validates `Origin` (with `Referer` fallback) on POST/PUT/DELETE
- Allowed origins are seeded via `build_allowed_origins()` at startup: `127.0.0.1:{port}`, `localhost:{port}`, `kirocrew.localhost:{port}`, plus configured host and machine hostname when not local-only, plus `localhost:3000` in dev mode. An explicitly enabled but initially unresolved Tailnet origin retries in a non-blocking background task (2-second exponential backoff, capped at 60 seconds); after re-reading the opt-in, re-checking the governance ceiling, and validating the daemon's MagicDNS name, it adds exactly that HTTPS origin to the same live set. The aiohttp app mapping remains frozen; only the pre-created set and runtime state value are mutated on the event loop
- Shared `check_origin()` function used by both CSRF middleware and WebSocket origin check — single source of truth
- Both entrypoints (`start_dashboard` and the headless `start_api_server`) build the barrier from the shared `_make_csrf_middleware` factory, so — exactly as for the Host barrier — the exemption set below is a single decision that cannot be granted on one server and withheld on the other
- **Self-authenticating-webhook exemption (`token_auth.CSRF_EXEMPT_EXACT_METHODS`)**: exactly two paths skip the Origin check, each for POST only — `POST /api/messaging/teams` (`TEAMS_WEBHOOK_PATH`) and `POST /api/hooks/agent` (`AGENT_HOOK_PATH`). Both callers are server-to-server, send neither `Origin` nor `Referer`, and `check_origin` accepts a header-less request only from a loopback peer or the unix socket — so without the exemption each route answers 403 before its handler runs whenever the caller reaches the gateway directly (the Bot Framework Connector against a public hostname on a VM/App Service; a CI runner or review bot posting a hook from off-host), with no setting that widens it. Compensating control: neither handler reads a cookie, so the browser-with-auto-attached-cookies threat CSRF exists for does not apply, and each authenticates its own credential — the Bot Framework JWT (issuer, App-ID audience, RS256 signature over the Bot Framework JWKS, expiry) for Teams, and the webhook bearer token for the hook, where `_verify_hook_token` compares against the sha256 of every stored entry with `hmac.compare_digest` and stays the **sole** gate (401 when none match, including on a fresh install with no token at all). The two credentials are not equally strong and the code says so: the JWT is Microsoft-signed and unforgeable by anyone else, while the hook token is locally generated and user-managed, so its strength is the operator's handling of whichever runner holds it. What the exemption changes is only *reachability* — a leaked hook token was already sufficient from a loopback or proxied peer. Both routes throttle failed auth per source (`webhooks.auth_throttle`), the Teams route additionally caps the body at `TEAMS_MAX_ACTIVITY_BYTES` before delegating, and every hook 401 is recorded in the run history. The map is method-scoped for the same reason the token-auth bypass is, and on the hook path that scope closes a live collision rather than a hypothetical one: the literal `agent` also matches the `{hook_id}` wildcard of the dashboard-authed PUT/DELETE `/api/hooks/{hook_id}` CRUD routes. Any **third** entry is a security review; `test_teams_webhook_hardening.py` pins the whole map and drives the real middleware for both directions on both paths

**Host-header validation (DNS-rebinding defense)** (`server.py` + `origin.py`):
- `host_validation_middleware` (`server.py`) rejects any request whose `Host` header does not name a host the dashboard serves. Both entrypoints (`start_dashboard` and the headless `start_api_server`) build it from the shared `_make_host_validation_middleware` factory — a single exemption point that cannot drift between the two chains. It is registered right after `deny_audit_middleware` and `host_canonical_redirect`, and before `no_cache_middleware`/`csrf_middleware`/token auth
- Runs on **every** HTTP method (not just mutating ones): a GET-based data exfiltration is the rebinding payload, and it is **independent** of the CSRF Origin check and loopback trust — a rebound request is loopback at the socket but forges `Host`
- **Probe exemption (`origin.PROBE_PATHS`)**: `/api/health`, `/api/live`, `/api/ready` bypass the barrier — orchestrator probes (kubelet, Docker HEALTHCHECK, LBs) address the gateway by container/pod IP, which is never in the host allowlist. Compensating control: `_liveness_payload` gates the build-identity fields on `check_host` AND `is_direct_local_request`, so a rebound request learns only `{"ok": true}` — indistinguishable from a bare TCP connect succeeding. The exemption set is frozen and any addition to `PROBE_PATHS` is a security review; regression tests drive disallowed-Host probes through a real middleware chain (`test_api_health.py`)
- `check_host()` (`origin.py`) compares the `Host` header (port-stripped, lower-cased) against `build_allowed_hosts()` (`origin.py`), which derives the host allowlist from the SAME `allowed_origins` set the CSRF check uses (so the two layers never drift) plus the canonical loopback names as a floor. Comparison is **port-independent** (hostname only), so an SSH-tunnel local port still matches
- **Deny-by-default**: a missing/empty `allowed_origins` is treated as a denial (never fail-open); a missing/empty `Host` is allowed **only** from a loopback `request.remote` (local IPC clients like mcp-core/doctor that omit `Host`), positively confirmed rather than blanket-allowed
- Rejects unknown Hosts with `403 Host header not allowed` + a `log_api_access` SEL event (`outcome="denied"`)

**Deny-before-audit boundary** (`server.py`):
- `sel_audit_middleware` is registered INNER to the Host, CSRF and token barriers, so a refusal one of them raises is a 403 that middleware never observes. The three known sites each call the shared `_audit_denied` helper (off the event loop, best-effort), but that is a convention a fourth site can omit — and the omission is invisible in production, since the refusal simply appears in no log
- `deny_audit_middleware` (`_make_deny_audit_middleware`, shared factory, installed on BOTH entrypoints outer to every barrier) makes the recording positional instead: it catches a raised 401/403 on the way out and audits it through the same helper unless an inner layer already claimed the request. A future deny site that forgets everything is still recorded; what forgetting costs is the record's reason DETAIL, not the record
- The audit surface widens by exactly ONE record class, and it is the class this control exists for. A layer CLAIMS a request (`origin.AUDIT_CLAIMED_KEY`, set through `origin.mark_audit_claimed`) exactly when it wrote the specific record itself: the two barriers via `_audit_denied`, `sel_audit_middleware` for the mutating `/api/` requests it actually logs (so its `outcome="error"` entry for a handler's 403 is not doubled), and the two WebSocket-origin handlers that log their own denial (`stt_stream.py`, `handlers/terminal.py`). The claim marker lives in `origin.py` rather than `server.py` because those handlers cannot import `server` without a cycle. `token_auth_middleware` RETURNS its 401/403 rather than raising and audits each with a specific reason code, and returned responses are not inspected here. Only 401/403 count as refusals — a 302 from host canonicalization and a 404 from routing pass through untouched. The one refusal that reaches the boundary unclaimed is `ws.py`'s cross-origin WebSocket 403 (`_check_ws_origin`), which audited nothing of its own and so was previously recorded nowhere. `test_api_health.py` drives these properties through a real middleware chain, including a synthetic barrier that audits nothing, and walks every `raise web.HTTPForbidden`/`HTTPUnauthorized` in the tree asserting that each self-auditing site claims

**WebSocket origin validation** (`ws.py` + `origin.py`):
- `_check_ws_origin()` calls shared `check_origin(require=True)` before `ws.prepare()`
- Reads `app["allowed_origins"]` (same set as CSRF middleware)
- Rejects missing Origin (non-browser clients) and cross-origin requests
- **Same-origin loopback fallback**: when an `Origin` is not in the
  allowed set, it is still accepted if its host is loopback **and** it exactly
  equals the request `Host` header — a genuine same-origin request. This covers
  the multi-instance embedded iframe, which is served at `<host>:<tunnelPort>`
  and opens its WebSocket to that same `location.host` (so `Origin == Host`),
  without reopening SEC-016: an arbitrary-port local page's `Origin` differs
  from the gateway `Host`, and browsers forbid scripts from forging either
  header. Non-loopback `Origin == Host` is **not** auto-trusted (still allowlist-only).

### Slack Owner Authorization

**Deny-by-default owner lock**:
- `_init_socket_mode()` refuses to connect if `KIROCREW_OWNER_ID` is unset/empty
- `_on_event()` rejects all messages when owner ID is missing (secondary guard)

**Interactive button verification** (5 defense-in-depth layers):
1. Owner check in `_handle_interactive()` — deny-by-default (rejects unless positively confirmed)
2. Owner check in `handle_interaction()` — handler defense-in-depth
3. `conversations.info` DM gate for Trust/YOLO actions
4. Trust/YOLO buttons suppressed in group channels
5. `disable_yolo()` + `yolo off` keyword to reverse YOLO

Non-owners receive ephemeral message: "⛔ Only the Kiro Crew owner can use these buttons."

**Safety override (YOLO) — time-limited with re-authorization** (`safety_override.py`):

Permanent YOLO mode has been eliminated. All activations go through the `SafetyOverride` singleton, which enforces a single ad-hoc duration shared by every surface (`agent.yolo_duration`, default 6 hours, hard ceiling 24 hours). Per-surface TTLs (Slack 30 min / dashboard 6 h / config 24 h) were removed: the same operator re-enabling the same grant got a different lifetime depending on where they clicked, which was unpredictable without buying any security. The declared `dangerouslySkipPermissions` grant and the `until_shutdown` ad-hoc duration are governed separately (see `safety_override.py`).

After expiry, re-authorization is required. A 5-minute grace window allows `!yolo renew` (Slack) or the dashboard re-auth button to extend the session without creating a new one. Outside the grace window, a fresh activation is needed.

**The grant is process-global; approval modes are per-slot.** `POST /api/chat/mode` sets `normal` / `trust_reads` / `trust` against the slot named in `slot` (or every slot when it is omitted), while `yolo` is the global grant and ignores `slot`. Because the grant covers every slot, a **slot-scoped** `trust`/`trust_reads` does NOT revoke it: that request asks for auto-approval on one slot and cannot be answered by withdrawing authority from slots it never named (the shape that let a programmatic per-slot `trust` end an operator's live grant). Every other mode change still revokes, so `normal` remains the off-switch at any scope. A grant DECLARED in owner-only config is exempt from the narrowing — it has no TTL, and selecting another approval mode is the one action documented to end it. That exemption keys on the grant's **source** (`SafetyOverride.is_declared`), never its permanence: an `until_shutdown` ad-hoc pick is equally permanent and keeps the scope protection, while a declared grant the governance ceiling refused to make permanent is timed and still counts as declared.

SEL audit events are emitted on every lifecycle transition:
- `safety_override:activate` — override enabled
- `safety_override:renew` — session extended within grace window
- `safety_override:expired` — TTL reached, auto-deactivated
- `safety_override:deactivate` — manually disabled; emitted for every explicit deactivation against a grant that exists in any form, including one whose TTL already lapsed (`resources` records the pre-call state: `was_active`, `was_permanent`, `remaining`, `prior_source`). Only a never-activated instance stays silent.

Transitions that create or extend auto-approval authority (`activate`,
`activate_scoped`, `renew`) are audited fail-closed: the SEL event is written
with `critical=True` before the state commits, and a failed write refuses the
grant or extension (`renew` returns `reason: audit_failed` with the deadline
unmoved). Because the SEL write runs outside the state lock, `renew` re-verifies
under the re-acquired lock before committing: a grant deactivated during the
audit window is not resurrected, a fresh activation that landed in that
window keeps its own deadline instead of being overwritten by the stale
renewal, and a renewal that began on a live grant refuses to commit through
the grace window (so a grant that lapsed or was switched off mid-audit stays
off).

Fleet governance endpoints:
- `/api/status` now reports `yolo_active` (bool) and `yolo_expires_at` (ISO 8601) fields
- `/api/admin/compliance/yolo-status` provides full override status (source, remaining time, activation count, renewal history)

Expiry notifications are delivered via Dashboard WebSocket and Slack DM to inform the user before and at override expiration. The Slack expiry DM flows through a shared redacting `_dm_owner` exit point (`dashboard/server.py`): text passes `redact_exfiltration_urls()` then `redact_credentials()` before `post_message`, so any future caller forwarding LLM/user-derived content cannot leak credentials or exfil URLs.

**Challenge-and-redirect for Slack direct requests** — **REMOVED**
(`slack/events.py`, `slack/allowlist.py`):

> The redirect flow intercepted every inbound Slack message and turned it into
> a presigned dashboard-session link (deny-by-default), an enterprise-internal-only
> posture. It has been removed for external/open-source usage: Slack messages
> are processed **inline** and reach the agent directly, gated by the user
> allowlist and the Enterprise Grid origin check. `send_channel_challenge()`
> and the `_CHALLENGE_REDIRECT_ENABLED` gate no longer exist; do not restore
> them on an upstream sync.

**Dynamic Dashboard one-shot consent** binds registry origin, recorded session
and request ID. The coordinator endpoint's optional
`origin=coordinator&slot=…&instance=…` selector checks the exact inventory slot
and the record's instance, and resolves only its live state future, without
yielding between check and resolution. The instance is minted by the coordinator
once per request and carried on the record; the request ID is the caller's and
can recur in the same slot, so a card rendered from an expired record cannot
resolve the request that replaced it. An earlier wait's exit removes only its own
record and future, judged by the future it created, so a replacement registered
under the same ID stays resolvable. A selector naming no instance is malformed
and returns 400. The native slot endpoint's optional
`origin: native` body selector requires an explicit request ID, `request_mid`
and one-shot action. The host permission row's existing `meta.mid` is associated
with the exact registered future; projection and submission both verify that
association, so ACP reconnect ID reuse cannot transfer old consent. Cleanup
only removes the future and association it owns and never broadcasts a stale
resolution over a replacement. The strict endpoint
never adopts another slot's future or falls back to the coordinator. Missing or
expired targets return 404. Omitting the selector retains established behavior
for older approval surfaces. These selectors narrow resolution, not authorization
or permission mode; the existing caller gates still run first.

The host approval card displays the redacted `tool_purpose` from that exact
native permission event (read from the params the preceding `tool_call` cached,
else the permission frame's own `rawInput`) or coordinator inventory record, never a reason inferred
from the command, title, or session task. An absent reason is explicitly missing.
The coordinator redacts a purpose and bounds it to the same 8,000-byte UTF-8 cap,
with a visible truncation notice, when it records the request, so an oversized
purpose is never retained or broadcast; its slot projections apply the cap again.
Native purposes retain their upstream cap and notice without being capped again.
The cap changes no approval authority.
Native `rejected_once` skips that request without rejecting the remaining tool
batch; a coordinator refusal resolves its boolean future to false. Neither
changes permission mode or promises that the agent continues. Copies in other
views describe the same request and reconcile on refresh. Normal mode asks for
tools requiring approval, not every action. Invalid strict selectors return
`400 / invalid_approval_target`; a missing strict native future returns
`404 / approval_not_pending` without cross-origin fallback.

**3-tier interactive trust escalation** (`dashboard/chat_runner.py`, `dashboard/chat_handlers.py`):

When the dashboard presents a tool approval prompt, users can now choose from three trust levels:

| Action | Scope | What it trusts |
|--------|-------|---------------|
| `trust_command` | Session-scoped | Exact command/tool (e.g., `ls /tmp`) |
| `trust_base` | Session-scoped | Base command glob (e.g., `ls *` — trusts `ls` with any arguments) |
| `yolo` | Global | All tools across all slots (existing behavior, now time-limited) |

Trust patterns are stored per-slot as session-scoped fnmatch globs
(`slot._trusted_patterns`). For shell tools, both halves of the decision use the
ACTUAL command from `tool_input`: the runner derives the pending grant scope
from it, and later matching evaluates the next call against it. For non-shell
tools with no structured input, both halves use the server/tool pair recovered
by `toolCallId` from the preceding ACP `tool_call` frame's `_meta.kiro` cache.
The UI retains the ACP-compatible `mcp__<server>__<tool>` display spelling, but
durable trust uses a separate versioned key whose independently lowercased
UTF-8 components are hex encoded. This makes the identity injective even when a
server or tool contains `__`; the wire/display spelling is never authorization
authority. Structured params remain attached to a repeated permission event;
their presence disables canonical non-shell grantability and matching, so a
same-`toolCallId` re-prompt cannot turn an argument-bearing call into an inputless
one. A missing server/tool identity or a pre-upgrade pending card without the
internal key fails closed for durable trust while ordinary Allow once and Reject
remain available. Existing broad `*` trust retains its established semantics;
legacy ambiguous exact MCP display patterns do not match the new internal keys.

The `pattern` submitted by the dashboard is a consent proof, not authority: it
must equal the server-derived field on the still-pending approval. Missing,
underivable, redaction-changing, or stale/mismatched patterns return a typed 400
without resolving the approval and are SEL-audited. Exact-command grants escape
fnmatch metacharacters before storage, so trusting the literal command
`rm *.tmp` does not also trust `rm secret.tmp`. Base grants are also derived
server-side; assignment-prefixed bases such as `FOO=bar` are refused rather than
becoming broad globs. Command parsing and matching live in the shared
`trust_patterns.py` module so another approval surface consumes a command-shaped
API instead of importing dashboard runner internals or fabricating a
`Running: ...` title.

**Child-fidelity split: identity vs arguments.** A backend-subagent permission
event whose structured params never reached the tool_call cache is low-fidelity
(`AcpEvent.child_low_fidelity`) and is excluded from every content-matching
auto-approve path — trusted patterns, trust-reads, title-keyed
`auto_approve_tools` — because the agent-authored title/params ARE the matched
input. A remote (HTTP) MCP server legitimately streams empty `rawInput` on its
`tool_call` frames, so every such child call is low-fidelity; but the same
frame's `_meta.kiro` server/tool identity is cache-provenance and
non-model-authored. `AcpEvent.child_mcp_identity_trusted` isolates that half
(requires: child origin, RESOLVED non-shell classification, canonical
server+tool recovered from cache, AND the explicit `mcp_identity_trusted`
provenance flag — set only when the trusted population actually happened: in
`build_permission_event` it is derived from the origin-scoped cache reads
HITTING (never from cache availability or field non-emptiness — a hit whose
cached value is `""` still earns it), the `_meta.kiro` tool_call builders set
it only when their extractors actually produced an identity pair (a frame
without `_meta.kiro` populates nothing and asserts no provenance), and
`_to_llm_event` copies it; it mirrors
`raw_params_trusted`, so a future inline population path fails closed instead
of counting as verified on non-emptiness alone). `child_mcp_identity_trusted`
does NOT require a resolved shell classification: a backend may omit `kind` on
its MCP `tool_call` frames, leaving the shell cache unwritten, and the trusted
transport identity is itself proof the call is MCP-served and not a host shell
command (a host shell or builtin never carries a server name — `acp-client.md`
§ Tool Permission Protocol). That proof stays confined to the identity-only
property: minting a resolved `shell_classified` from it would flip
`child_low_fidelity` to `False` and un-gate the content-matching auto-approve
paths for a kindless mutating call with a read-looking, agent-authored title.
A `kind` that resolved to execute still caches `is_shell=True`, which keeps
the identity split closed for shell calls. The grant-eligibility
expression is hoisted to one place,
`AcpEvent.child_unconditional_grant_eligible`
(`not child_low_fidelity or child_mcp_identity_trusted`), consumed by all
three approval surfaces (dashboard runner, Slack gateway, subagent manager):
**unconditional** grants — session trust-all, global YOLO,
`parent_policy=auto`, per-source auto-approve, the `--approval yolo` override —
honor the grant for eligible events: the approve decision consumes no
agent-authored event data, only the arguments remain unverified (the same
blindness the interactive card has; the identity split changes WHO approves,
not what any gate can scan). Shell events never qualify: their deny gates need
the command bytes the event lacks. **Identity-keyed grants** are the second
kind an identity-verified child may take, and the reason a user's NARROW
allowance still means something for a fan-out: a grant whose matched input is
that same verified `_meta.kiro` pair and nothing the agent authors. Three
paths qualify — the TrustDropdown's non-shell grant (`approval_command` keys it
on `mcp-trust:v1:<server>:<tool>`, so the dashboard runner admits an
identity-verified child to the `_trusted_patterns` match), the hook gate's
app-own-server grant, and an `auto_approve_tools` pattern matched against the identity as
`Running: @server/tool` / `@server/tool` (never the lossy `mcp__server__tool`
wire form, under which two identities can collide) INSTEAD of the title, for every caller, and only when the caller also
threads the event's `mcp_identity_trusted` provenance flag (an identity that is
present but unproven keeps the title match). The user's `auto_deny_tools` globs
— and only those, never the shipped shell regexes — are also matched against
the same `@server/tool` / `Running: @server/tool` / `@server` spellings whenever
the server name is present, so a deny written in the spelling the approve loop
teaches binds on the identity plane and deny still beats approve there. The hook reports the last two with
`ToolHookResult.identity_grant`, and the child-admission rule lives in two
places only: `hooks.identity_grant_covers_child`, which both the dashboard
runner and the subagent manager consult before letting a hook auto-approve
stand for a low-fidelity child, and `AcpEvent.child_unconditional_grant_eligible`,
which the dashboard runner already binds for the unconditional grants and now
also gates the TrustDropdown match (a full-fidelity event, or a low-fidelity
child whose identity verified — the same boolean, no second spelling). When an
approve pattern matches only the title of an identity-verified MCP call, the gate
logs once per (pattern, identity) which `@server/tool` rewrite restores the grant. A
side effect of threading the identity to every caller: the governance deny
floor now sees `canonical_mcp_name` on the Slack, Discord, Telegram, messaging
and task-runner surfaces too, so an MCP-keyed governance deny binds there as
it already did on the dashboard (a tightening toward `POLICY ∩ PROFILE`). Every
grant that read the title, the payload's `kind` or a command — the read-only
kind allow-list, the `_is_read_only_tool` title heuristic, trust-reads —
stays downgraded for such a child exactly as before.

### SEL Audit Logging (`sel.py`)

See `docs/system-specs/modules/sel.md` for full spec. Every event carries a `source` stamped by `_infer_source`; that function's return vocabulary IS the set of audited surfaces and is published via `sel.audit_sources()` (consumed by the security-posture view, so the count is derived rather than restated here).

**What counts as an auditable permission decision.** A SEL event is emitted when a decision has a *subject* — a tool/capability that was granted or denied. The audit records grants and denies, not the absence of any decision:

- **Skill triggering** (`skills.py:get_triggered_skills`, runs per message) emits **one** event per call when at least one skill was injected (`outcome="triggered"`, grant) or actively excluded by a negative trigger that would otherwise have matched (`outcome="denied"`, with the excluded skills in `metadata.negated`). When no skill matched and none was negated — the overwhelmingly common case — **no event is emitted**: nothing was granted or injected into LLM context, so there is no permission decision with a subject to record (analogous to not auditing an authz check that had nothing to authorize). This is a deliberate, threat-model-reviewed choice: the prior per-skill "not_triggered" logging was a per-message synchronous-write hot-path cost, and a per-message "matched nothing" event would dwarf the real grant/deny signals and *reduce* the audit trail's usefulness rather than improve it. The message text is already captured in conversation history; skill names are not secret.

### Security Posture Detail Registry (`security_posture.py`)

The Settings → Security "Live Security Posture" card renders from
`GET /api/security/posture`, whose payload is built by
`security_posture.build_posture_snapshot()`. It exists to fix a class of bug, not
just to add a view: the panel previously rendered **hardcoded counts** that had
silently drifted several-fold from reality — every one of `13` sensitive paths,
`42` suspicious patterns, `5` redaction paths, and `12` tool schemas was wrong —
and a reader had no way to see what any count covered.

**Do not write the current values into this doc.** Restating them here is how the
original bug propagated (the dashboard's hardcoded `5` was transcribed from a doc
sentence), and a literal added here goes stale the moment a control grows — as one
did while this very section was being written. Read the live counts from
`GET /api/security/posture`, or from `security_posture.posture_counts()`.

**Derivation invariant.** Every control's `count` is `len(items)` — the pill and the
expanded list can never disagree — and `items` are produced by an `items_fn`
callable resolved **per request** against the live control.
`api_security_stats` re-sources its counts from this registry, so there is exactly
one place a count is computed. Controls split into two classes:

- **Derived (7):** items come straight from the enforcing object —
  `security.sensitive_home_dirs()`, `write_protected_home_paths()`,
  `BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES`, `SUSPICIOUS_BASH_PATTERNS`, the MCP dispatch registries
  (`MCP_CORE_SCHEMAS` / `MCP_CRON_SCHEMAS`, **not** the `*_SCHEMA` naming
  convention — several registered tools are inline/shared schemas with no
  module-level name), `exfil_query_min_len()`, and `sel.audit_sources()`. For these
  drift is structurally impossible.
- **Curated (3):** `_REDACTION_SINKS`, `_CREDENTIAL_FAMILIES`, `_EXFIL_HEURISTICS`
  have no single live list to enumerate (a sink is a *call site*, a family is a
  *regex alternative*, a heuristic is a *branch*). A `len()` of a hand-written
  tuple would merely relocate the original stale-number bug into this module, so
  each is paired with an **omission-detecting** test in
  `test_security_posture.TestOmissionDetection`:
  - the redaction registry is checked against **every** redactor call site in the
    package — each module must be a registered sink or an explicitly-reasoned
    entry in `NON_EGRESS_REDACTION_MODULES` (with a companion test rejecting stale
    allowlist entries), so a new output path cannot be added without classifying it.
    The detector regex must stay broad enough to see **every wrapper**
    (`redact_and_truncate`, `redact_via_context`, qualified `security.redact(...)`,
    `StreamRedactor`), because a form missing from it is the same omission hole one
    level up — a narrow earlier version silently skipped the `redact_and_truncate`
    Slack egress in `dashboard/chat_slack.py` and `slack/blocks.py`. Prefer
    over-matching: an extra module is classified once, whereas a missed one is
    invisible forever;
  - each advertised credential family must have a synthetic sample that
    `redact_credentials()` actually fires on, and the family list and sample table
    must match exactly (so a new regex alternative without a row fails);
  - each advertised exfil heuristic must have a URL that `scan_exfiltration_urls()`
    actually flags, with the same exact-match requirement.

  An omission is the failure mode that shipped "5 output paths" against several times that many.
  Only a test that detects an omission catches it; a `len()` assertion never will.

**Disclosure contract (posture-only, mirroring the governance viewer).** The
payload carries public control *definitions* and derived counts only:

- **Included**: blocked path patterns (the blocklist is already public in
  `docs/architecture/security-deep-dive.md`; knowing `~/.aws` is blocked does not help reach
  it), redaction-sink module names, credential **family** names, heuristic
  descriptions, audited surface names, deny-rule *descriptions*.
- **Excluded**: credential material, governance policy/profile **rule contents**
  (the ceiling the agent is fenced from — this endpoint must not become a side
  channel around the governance viewer's counts-only rule), user data, and the raw
  deny **regexes** (those keep their own opt-out surface in Card A's chevron).
- A pinned test asserts the entire JSON payload passes **both** redaction passes
  (`redact_credentials()` **and** `redact_exfiltration_urls()`, plus the dual-pass
  `redact()`) **unchanged** — so a description written with a live credential or
  long-query-URL shape in it (e.g. a literal bearer-header example) fails CI
  rather than shipping a row that renders as `[REDACTED: …]` wherever the payload
  is itself scanned (the SEL audit log, a Slack-relayed summary). A companion test
  proves the guard is non-vacuous.
- The governance boundary is pinned on **provenance, not key names**: a test
  asserts this module's source contains no reference to the governance machinery
  (`platform.governance`, `governance_profiles`, `resolve_active_scope`,
  `current_context`, `security_policy`/`admission_policy`). A name-only guard
  ("no control key contains `policy`") is trivially bypassed — a control keyed
  `ceiling_scopes` could republish literal policy deny globs and still pass it.
  If the module cannot *reach* governance, it cannot leak it under any key name.

Automatic session cards register `dashboard/card_lifecycle.py` as an egress sink:
the bounded transcript window crosses into a background model, and its returned
HTML/text crosses into the owner-visible cache. Both passes redact credentials
and exfiltration URLs before either boundary. Output JSON is decoded before
scanning accepted HTML and flat data values, so JSON escapes cannot bypass the
output scan. Redaction-changing field names reject the update without renaming
bindings. A final data-object check retains label-dependent credential detection;
an unsafe object is rejected, not structurally rewritten. Rejected content retains
the valid last-good card. The read-only owner GET does not
start generation; this boundary is not a non-egress allowlist exception.

**Honest per-sink coverage.** Most redaction sinks run both scanners; a few run
only one (`task_reporter.py` is exfil-URL-only; `sel.py`'s on-disk writer signs
bytes as-written, so its callers redact before `log`). Those rows say so in their
own detail text, and a test asserts a partially-covered sink cannot be described
without that disclosure. Likewise, the `suspicious_patterns` row states it is
**advisory** (surfaced by the `kirocrew` history scan via `audit_bash_command`),
not enforced at the PreToolUse gate — the gate uses the narrower
`audit_bash_exfiltration` plus the denied-command rules.

**`/api/security/stats` is retained but no longer used by the dashboard**, which
reads `/api/security/posture` (same counts plus the items). It re-sources via
`posture_counts_async`, which resolves every `items_fn` — so the count is still
`len(items)` — without materializing or serializing the ~45 KB item payload to
return three integers. A test pins the two paths to identical values so they
cannot become a second, divergent count source.

**Executor choice.** `build_posture_snapshot_async` / `posture_counts_async` offload to the dedicated
`governance_executor` (`mc-gov`), NOT the shared default pool — the same choice
`build_governance_policy_snapshot_async` makes, for the same reason: this GET is
browser-triggerable, so once a control does filesystem I/O (the case the
per-request `items_fn` design exists to keep safe) default-pool I/O would contend
with the workers the event loop shares for DNS.

**Failure isolation.** A control whose `items_fn` raises degrades to
`{"count": null, "unavailable": true, "items": []}` and the remaining controls
still render. The frontend shows an explicit `unavailable` badge — never `0`,
which would tell an operator that a live control covers nothing.

**Denied-commands count is the one runtime-variable pill.** The registry reports
the **shipped** built-in rule table; the panel overrides that row's pill with
the **effective** count from `GET /api/security/denied-commands` (after user
opt-outs and governance pins), because that is what is actually enforced.

**Public accessors.** `security/` exposes `sensitive_home_dirs()`,
`write_protected_home_paths()`, `crew_home_prefixes()`, and
`exfil_query_min_len()` (returning tuples/ints, so a caller cannot mutate a live
blocklist) — the same decoupling rationale as `get_credential_patterns()`: a
future rename of the private name cannot silently turn the posture view into a
lie. `security_posture.py` is a leaf module; the two `token_auth` TTL constants are
imported function-locally to avoid the `kiro_crew.dashboard` package cycle.

### Frontend Security

- **No `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` with unsanitized content** — all HTML content sanitized via DOMPurify
- **Safe DOM APIs** — `createElement` + `textContent` for error fallbacks (not `innerHTML`)
- **Ref callbacks** for highlight.js output (DOMPurify-sanitized)
- **React text children** instead of `esc()` + `sanitize()` HTML strings
- **No regex URL linkification in HTML strings** — use React elements via `.split()`
- **Shell injection prevention** — `/etc/hosts` update uses `sudo tee -a` (not `sh -c echo`)

## Security Rules for Development

When writing new code, these rules MUST be followed:

### Backend
1. **Never read sensitive paths** — all file reads must go through `hooks.py` which enforces `is_sensitive_path()` and `is_sensitive_bash_command()`, or, for a reader that has just canonicalised its own path, through `security.is_sensitive_canonical_path()` on that path followed by the pinned open `pinned_fs.open_fenced_for_read()` (the artifact store's file helpers and the agent-spec readers); every other read shape is a violation
2. **Never trust LLM output** — scan with `redact_exfiltration_urls()` before posting to any external surface (Slack, dashboard, API responses)
3. **Validate all MCP tool inputs** — use `validation.py` schemas; never pass raw LLM input to filesystem, subprocess, or database operations
4. **Deny-by-default for authorization** — reject unless positively confirmed. Never use `if x and y and z` guards where any falsy value skips the check
5. **Sandbox all agent subprocesses** — new subprocess spawning must go through `AcpClient._spawn()` which applies OS-level sandbox
6. **Enforce denied commands** — new destructive CLI-facing tools must be covered by a `DeniedCommandRule` in `BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES` (`security/`); enforcement is at the hooks PreToolUse gate, never via kiro agent-config injection
7. **Log security events** — all tool invocations and permission *decisions* (a capability granted or denied) must emit SEL events. The absence of a decision — e.g. skill-trigger matching that injected and excluded nothing — is not itself an auditable event (see "What counts as an auditable permission decision" above)

### Frontend
1. **Never use `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`** without DOMPurify sanitization
2. **Never use `innerHTML`** — use `textContent`, `createElement`, or React elements
3. **Never construct HTML strings with user/LLM content** — use React components
4. **Sanitize all external content** — use `md()`, `sanitize()`, or `esc()` from `helpers.ts`
5. **No inline event handlers in HTML strings** — use React event props

### Binary File Handling (`security/`, `handlers/files.py`, `mcp_core.py`)

The `file_send` MCP tool and outbox handlers support binary media files with a deny-by-default MIME allowlist.

#### BINARY_MIME_ALLOWLIST

Module-level constant in `security/`. Only these MIME types are accepted for binary (non-UTF-8) files:

| Category | Types |
|----------|-------|
| Audio | `audio/mpeg`, `audio/wav`, `audio/x-wav`, `audio/ogg`, `audio/flac`, `audio/aac`, `audio/mp4`, `audio/webm`, `audio/opus` |
| Video | `video/mp4`, `video/webm`, `video/ogg` |
| Image | `image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`, `image/webp`, `image/bmp` |
| Document | `application/pdf` |

**Excluded:** `image/svg+xml` (XSS vector — SVG can contain `<script>` tags).

#### Security Model

| File type | Content scan | MIME check | Disposition |
|-----------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Text (UTF-8 decodable) | `redact()` for credentials/exfiltration | N/A | `attachment` |
| Binary (in allowlist) | Skipped (can't redact binary) | Must be in `BINARY_MIME_ALLOWLIST` | `inline` (browser renders natively) |
| Binary (not in allowlist) | N/A | Rejected with 400/403 | N/A |
| SVG (UTF-8 decodable) | `redact()` for credentials/exfiltration | Not in allowlist (text path) | `attachment` (never inline — defense-in-depth against XSS) |

#### Response Headers

All outbox downloads include:
- `Content-Type`: from `mimetypes.guess_type()` or `application/octet-stream`
- `Content-Disposition`: `inline` for media, `attachment` for others
- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`: prevents MIME sniffing attacks

#### Invariants

- Path traversal protection unchanged (resolved path must be under `outbox_dir()`)
- Filename sensitivity check unchanged (`redact(filename) == filename`)
- Text content redaction unchanged for UTF-8 files
- Binary files: filename validated, content scan skipped (binary data cannot be meaningfully redacted)
- Dashboard multipart uploads open their destination with `O_BINARY` when the
  host provides it, so Windows cannot translate embedded LF bytes to CRLF and
  corrupt archives or media between validation and the restricted write.

#### Slack Delivery Audience — Strict Caller-Identity Classification (`file_send`)

`file_send` may additionally upload the file to Slack. The Slack **audience**
(which thread, or the whole channel) is decided from the CALLER's own session
identity, resolved **strictly** — gateway-injected `KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY` env
var or an HMAC-sidecar-verified host-pid only; **no** `/proc` ancestor walk and
**no** `session_pid_*.txt` filesystem glob. This closes both the
forged-`session_pid_*.txt` path and the subagent→parent misresolution path
(`_resolve_session_key_strict()` in `mcp_core.py`).

The identity is classified into **three** states by
`_classify_slack_identity() -> (state, thread_ts|None)`. Collapsing the two
non-thread cases into a bare `None` was a channel-root disclosure hazard: an
**unresolved** caller that still supplied an explicit tracked channel would
upload at the **channel ROOT** (`thread_ts=None` + channel), exposing a file
meant for one thread to the entire channel — fail-**OPEN** with respect to
audience. The states:

| State | Meaning | `file_send` disposition |
|-------|---------|-------------------------|
| `thread` | Resolved Slack thread — a canonical `slack:<thread_ts>` key (converted via `messaging.link.legacy_key`) or an already-bare legacy Slack key | Upload **threaded** to that `thread_ts` |
| `non_slack` | Resolved non-Slack session (`dashboard:`/`discord:`/app/channel/future namespace) — identity is KNOWN | Keep existing **authorized** routing (owner DM / session-map-linked thread / explicit tracked channel); none of these broadcast at a channel root for an unknown caller |
| `unresolved` | Strict resolution failed (no gateway env var and no HMAC-verified host-pid) — caller cannot be attributed | **Refuse the Slack upload entirely** (fail CLOSED for audience). The file is still delivered via the dashboard/outbox card |

On the `unresolved` refusal, `file_send` records a SEL
`log_tool_invocation(outcome="denied", downstream_service="slack",
error="slack_identity_unresolved_upload_refused")` event and returns a warning
noting the Slack upload was skipped (dashboard delivery still succeeds).

**Warm-pool sessions:** a warm-pool-claimed Slack session has no strict identity
source (the gateway writes the env var / HMAC sidecar only at sandbox spawn, not
at warm-pool claim), so every one of its `file_send` calls classifies as
`unresolved` → the upload is **refused**, not broadcast. There is no interim
window that broadcasts at a channel root. Restoring proper *threaded* delivery
for warm-pool Slack sessions (by writing the HMAC sidecar at warm-pool claim
time) is a delivery-quality follow-up, not an audience-safety gate — the
disclosure hazard is closed by the refuse-on-unresolved rule above.

#### Slack Upload Authorization Rungs (`file_send`)

Both `file_send` legs resolve their destination through one oracle (`dashboard/upload_destination`), and both run the same two ceilings there before any destination work:

| Rung | Predicate | Denial |
|------|-----------|--------|
| `channels`-scope governance | `upload_destination._slack_egress_permitted` → `vet_and_audit("channels", "slack", fail_closed=True)` | `403` `channels_governance_denied`, SEL governance decision recorded for grant AND denial |
| Restricted-session ceiling | `upload_gate.uploads_restricted(channel_type="slack")` — the predicate the channel leg and the Telegram/Discord renderers' extraction path share | `403` `restricted_session`, SEL-audited by the shared predicate |

On the Slack leg both are **direct calls**, not registry entries. Slack is deliberately absent from `channel_transports` (its dedicated client and streaming path are not registered), so it never reaches the shared send ladder that applies the governance vet for every other channel — the same situation `chat_compaction_notice._channel_egress_permitted` already resolves the same way. Registering Slack to reach the ladder would change what the registry means; a direct call to the audited seam does not.

Why this leg needs them most: Slack is the broadest-audience surface (a tracked channel can be company-visible) and the only leg whose destination a REQUEST can name (`body["channel"]`, falling back to the session-map link then the owner DM), while the channel leg's destination comes exclusively from the caller's own session-map entry. Without these rungs an incognito/temporary session that refuses to write a transcript, read memory or save a title still uploaded local file bytes into a Slack channel or DM, and a profile denying the `channels` scope refused a Telegram upload while allowing a Slack one.

**They precede destination resolution.** A denied caller never opens an owner DM and never reads the session map, so a refusal leaks nothing about where the file would have gone. (The shared admission gate — containment, MIME allowlist, content scans — still runs ahead of the oracle on both legs.)

**The restricted rung restores the durable flags first.** For a channel-native key the ceiling reads `privacy_mode`'s process-local trackers, which only an INBOUND channel message populates. A turn no inbound message drove — a cron, a webhook-resumed session, a monitor/auto-nudge re-injection, an explicit `file_send` — would otherwise read empty trackers after a gateway restart and ship the bytes the user's `!incognito` forbids. `uploads_restricted` therefore calls `privacy_mode.hydrate` before consulting them, the same canonical restore `_is_restricted_session` uses, so the fix lands once for every caller of the shared predicate (both `file_send` legs and the renderers' extraction path) rather than per leg.

**Sessionless callers are not muted.** The owner-DM fallback serves callers with no session of their own (a cron, the heartbeat, an out-of-band host action). An empty `X-Session-Key` is vetted under `HOST_SESSION_KEY` (`_host`), for the same reason `handlers.messaging` uses that sentinel on its channel legs: an empty key classifies as `unknown` and matches no profile at all, so vetting under it would make host-side governance inert here, while `_host` is the stable bind target operators attach it to. The restricted rung reads no slot and no channel privacy mode for such a key, so it answers permitted. Net effect on an ungoverned host: unchanged.

**Identity asymmetry is inherited, not widened.** The Slack leg resolves its caller LENIENTLY (`_resolve_session_key()`, including the `/proc` ancestor walk) while the channel leg is handed the strict key. Both rungs read that same lenient key; neither introduces a new identity source.

**Denials are refusals, not skips.** Both answer `403` with a machine-readable `code`, so the MCP tool surfaces "Slack upload failed" rather than reporting success for a file that never left. This differs deliberately from the channel leg, where "cannot deliver here" is the common case and a skip is correct.

**A skip is still REPORTED, on BOTH legs.** "Correct" is not "silent": each leg answers its own "cannot deliver here" as `{"ok": true, "skipped": "<reason>"}` — the channel leg over a closed vocabulary (`no_session`, `no_channel_destination`, `restricted_session`, `channel_upload_unsupported:<type>`) plus `delivered: false`, the Slack leg from `no_slack` and from the same destination oracle — and `file_send`, the only caller of either endpoint, renders that reason via `_describe_channel_skip` / `_describe_slack_skip`. Dropping it made the tool answer a bare `File sent:` for a file that reached only the dashboard, indistinguishable from a delivery, so a caller that chose the wrong tool had nothing to correct against; that is the same false-success hazard the Slack rung above closes by refusing, arriving through the skip path instead. Fixing one leg and leaving its sibling would leave the identical three-state read one branch away, so both are wired. Two branch rules carry security weight rather than ergonomics: the channel leg's `no_channel_destination` names the route that DOES work (an inline `![alt](/abs/path)` reference, which the renderer's extraction path uploads from the session's working directory), while `restricted_session` names **no** alternative — `uploads_restricted` is the predicate that extraction path shares, so the inline route is equally refused there and suggesting it would read as advice for routing around a privacy ceiling. `channel_upload_unsupported` names no route for a neighbouring reason: it fires for every channel with no document verb wired, a set spanning both `files_outbound` capabilities, and the reason string cannot tell them apart — so it reports that the channel has no upload path and leaves the channel type in the reason for a caller that wants to look further. The per-channel roster is deliberately written down in ONE place, `_describe_channel_skip`'s docstring, so a channel flipping the flag invalidates a single site. The Slack leg names no remedy at all, having no alternative route to offer. An unrecognized reason is reported verbatim, so a code added later degrades to visible rather than to silence. `test/test_file_send_skip_reason.py` pins each branch.


### Windows ACP creation-time cleanup ownership

`create_subprocess_limited(windows_cleanup_owner=...)` uses the reserved ACP
owner only on Windows. Its per-call CPython Proactor adapter records the exact
process handle at native `CreateProcess` return, before parent pipe-descriptor
cleanup, Popen publication, process-wait registration or async pipe setup. Thus
failure before an asyncio `Process` is returned cannot refund a surviving child.
No asyncio/Popen global or live event-loop method is replaced; unrelated launches
keep the existing factory. The adapter does not change argv, environment scrub,
sandbox policy, suspended flags, resource Job settings or POSIX semantics.
Cleanup bounds, borrowed-handle lifetime and the supported-transport limitation
are specified in [platform-compat](../common/platform-compat.md#windows-session-tree-teardown).
