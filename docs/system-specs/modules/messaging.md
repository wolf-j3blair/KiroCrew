# Messaging Transport Module

## Overview

`kiro_crew.messaging` is the channel-neutral transport abstraction used by the shipped Slack, Discord, Telegram, Webex, WeCom, Microsoft Teams, Weixin, iMessage, WhatsApp, and Feishu integrations; its conservative contract also leaves room for a further channel. It avoids re-implementing streaming, tool approval, session identity, or rendering for each integration. It holds the channel-neutral core of the Slack turn loop (`slack/handler.py::handle_message`) so a new channel implements only two small interfaces (a `MessagingTransport` + a `Renderer`) and inherits everything else.

**Dependency direction is one-way:** `slack` / `dashboard` → `messaging`, never the reverse. The `kiro_crew.messaging` package imports nothing from `kiro_crew.slack` or `kiro_crew.dashboard`; its only first-party dependencies are the shared lower-level helpers — `acp.types` event constants, the `security` redactors (`redact_credentials` / `redact_exfiltration_urls`), `sel` for audit, and, function-locally from `privacy_mode`, `session_map` (the durable flag) and `history` (the transcript header the mode is stamped into).

Slack's transport path is gated behind the `messaging.use_transport` config flag (default `true` in Kiro Crew, so the abstraction is the canonical path); when off, Slack's native `handle_message` path runs instead.

A resumed or linked member conversation retains its canonical execution record
on every channel: immutable member/store identity, captured provider template and
privacy mode. The shared pipeline resolves that record before asynchronous work.
Missing or malformed identity refuses routing without choosing Global. Learned
database unavailability does not prevent persona/project context; an explicit
memory operation reports that the captured store is unavailable. Unowned legacy
conversations retain V1. Provider template names do not select member memory.
Channel `spawn` and `bg` commands pass the captured execution to admission. The
child keeps that member/store even if the parent closes or changes selection.
Channel resume reads the recorded template directly; editable member labels and
legacy metadata do not override a canonical execution.

## Architecture — the three layers

```
 inbound event   Layer 1: MessagingTransport (per channel)
  ─────────────▶   receive() → drop bots → normalize → authorize()
                   → InboundMessage → dispatch callback
                            │
 provider stream  Layer 2: TurnDriver (channel-neutral)
  ─────────────▶   redact → approval ladder → OutputEvent
                   → Renderer.dispatch()
                            │
 channel API      Layer 2b: Renderer (per channel)
  ◀────────────    on_text_chunk / on_thinking / on_tool_call /
                   on_prompt_choice / on_compaction / on_done

 Layer 3 (cross-cutting): ChannelLink + session-key namespacing
   f"{channel_type}:{conversation_id}" ⇄ legacy bare Slack thread_ts
```

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `messaging/__init__.py` | Package facade re-exporting the public contracts, approval-mode constants, and Layer-3 helpers |
| `messaging/transport.py` | **Layer 1** — `MessagingTransport` ABC + the `TransportCapabilities`, `InboundMessage`, and `ConfiguredChannelTarget` value objects (stdlib-only) |
| `messaging/attachments.py` | Channel-neutral attachment classification, bounded streaming download, extraction/redaction, opaque-file preservation, temp ownership, and SEL audit |
| `messaging/driver.py` | **Layer 2** — `TurnDriver` (channel-neutral turn loop), approval-mode constants, `_redact` helper |
| `messaging/empty_turn_copy.py` | The sentences a turn that ended with no assistant text owes the user — the empty-turn verdict's wording, shared by the channel driver and the dashboard runner (`chat_runner`) so a channel thread mirrored into the dashboard reads one story. Two remedies, spelled once: a turn that did no work is told to resend; a turn whose tool already ran is told to continue from where it stopped, never to resend (a resend runs the side effect twice). Stdlib-only leaf, no `kiro_crew` imports |
| `messaging/renderer.py` | **Layer 2b** — `Renderer` ABC, `OutputEvent`, output-kind constants + `OUTPUT_KINDS`, `chunk_text` helper, `session_provenance_tag` (stable callback affinity without exposing session keys), `apply_options_cap`/`cap_choices`/`format_overflow` (`max_buttons` enforcement), `split_options_trailer` (the ONE `[OPTIONS:]` parse — see below), and `render_options_as_text` — the whole-trailer path for a channel with no widget, which reaches the same cap with zero slots so every choice becomes a numbered line (WeCom, Weixin, iMessage and Feishu call it; WhatsApp declares `max_buttons=0` and strips the trailer instead, so a `0` alone does not promise the list survives). Also `credential_redaction_notice(count)` — the one sentence a channel sends when credential redaction rewrote text it already delivered, so the reader learns a pasted command will not run. Shared so the wording cannot fork per channel and each spelling need its own audit for leaked bytes; it carries only the count, never secret bytes, and is plain text with no markup or emoji because one string ships to platforms that render different dialects (or none). `redaction_notice(cred_count, url_count)` is the by-kind superset every channel delivery surface now posts through: it delegates to `credential_redaction_notice` byte-for-byte when `url_count` is zero, and otherwise names the suspicious-URL rewrite (`security.EXFILTRATION_REDACTION_TAG_PREFIX`, counted by prefix because the tag interpolates the domain) with the URL remedy — re-check the link against a trusted source — because telling a reader whose URL was rewritten to "supply the secret" names a remedy that cannot help them. Zero/zero is a `ValueError`, never an empty message. `count_redaction_tags(text)` is the shared two-kind tally beside it — exact-match over `CREDENTIAL_REDACTION_TAGS`, prefix-match for the URL tag — so a surface cannot adopt half the count and post a notice worded for the wrong remedy; every counting site routes through it. The notice itself is posted IN-RENDERER at every channel delivery surface, one best-effort follow-up message per turn: each renderer counts the text IT actually delivered — which can differ from the driver's accumulated view, because several renderers run a second display-form redaction pass at their own egress (Slack, Telegram, Teams and Discord re-redact against what the platform RENDERS, so their delivered form can carry placeholders the driver's byte-level stream scan never wrote) — and a failed notice send is logged, never raised, because the answer is already out. It is never folded into the answer text: renderers refuse text once finalized, and prose after an `[OPTIONS:]` trailer breaks the trailer parsers, which require it to END the text. Discord and Telegram tally per LANDED message across seals, recovery re-posts and the posted reasoning (streaming edits supersede each other, so only sealed forms count); Slack counts the final display-safe body plus the posted 💭 reasoning in one tally; WeCom tallies at `on_done` but posts from `close()`, where its deferred-overflow delivery finally settles, consumed on the first call so a second `close()` cannot post twice; `SilentRenderer` posts nothing because it delivers nothing |
| `messaging/approval.py` | Two channel-neutral approval styles behind one INTERACTIVE `decider`, both deny-by-default on timeout (recording `last_deny_cause = approval_timeout` for the driver, below) and keyed `session_key`+`request_id`. **Typed reply** (`TEXT_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_S`, the verdict vocabulary, `TextReplyApprovalDecider`) for a `max_buttons=0` channel, with Trust recorded as the session's own approval policy rather than a second trust store. **Widget awaiter** (`PendingApprovals` + `SessionApprovalDecider`) for a press whose correlation id and per-prompt nonce travel a round trip this module cannot see (a Webex Adaptive Card over the device websocket); a typed answer has no nonce, a press has no free text. Also `adoptable_reservation(pending, loop)`, the one rule for whether a stored future may be adopted as a reservation: a channel's registry is process-global and outlives any one event loop, so an entry a closed loop left behind is reachable by key, and awaiting it raises `attached to a different loop` while its lack of a result is not a decision either. Foreign-loop entries are refused whether or not they carry a result, because a verdict recorded on a loop that has ended cannot answer a later request. It lives here, not in each channel, because three copies of an adoption rule is how the per-channel registries diverged in the first place |
| `messaging/driver.py` deny cause | A decider MAY carry `last_deny_cause` (`""` for a human's own answer, `constants.DENY_CAUSE_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT` when its prompt expired). After a denial the driver reads it and, for the timeout cause, awaits `deny_notice.steer_refusal_notice` BEFORE `reject_tool` (capability-gated on `provider.supports_refusal_steer`, bounded by `STEER_NOTICE_BOUND_SECS`, best-effort), so the model is told the prompt expired unanswered instead of reading kiro-cli's generic "User denied tool execution" as a human refusal. Cancellation mid-steer still answers the wire through a shielded, strongly referenced orphan reject. Every shipped decider records the cause: `TextReplyApprovalDecider`, `SessionApprovalDecider` (via `PendingApprovals.decide_with_cause`), `DiscordApprovalDecider`, `SlackApprovalDecider`, `TelegramApprovalDecider`, `TeamsApprovalDecider`. A plain callable without the attribute is a causeless denial, as before |
| `messaging/driver.py` `deny_all_tools` | Rejects EVERY permission request ahead of every approve path. The approval ladder cannot express "this sender is not the operator" on its own: the PreToolUse hook may answer `auto_approve` and the Trust/YOLO predicates approve and short-circuit, both BEFORE the ladder is consulted, so setting the mode to `interactive` without a decider is not sufficient. Not the whole enforcement: see `dispatch.TOOLLESS_TURN_AGENT` below. Defaults False |
| `messaging/dispatch.py` `TOOLLESS_TURN_AGENT` | `"kirocrew-guest"`: the agent a `deny_all_tools` turn is driven on. Its spec (`agent._install_guest_agent`, written beside the background `kirocrew-lite` on every rebuild) mounts `tools: []`, no MCP servers and `includeMcpJson: false` (so the user-level mcp.json is not mounted either), and carries a short conversational prompt of its own because a person is on the other end. Needed because a permission request is not guaranteed at all: a tool the operator's agent lists in `allowedTools` runs on the kiro backend without raising one, so the driver's refusal never sees it. `drive_turn` acquires the session under this agent when the flag is set and refuses the turn (`ToollessTurnUnavailable`, SEL `turn_agent` denied) when the session key handed in is already bound to another agent, since `get_or_create` keeps an existing session's agent, and when the provider's backend routing is not `Routing.AGENT_SPEC` (`agent_sdk.backends.routing_for`): only a harness that mounts what the spec names honours `tools: []`; one that reads no agent spec keeps its native tools and a project-preapproved one raises no permission request, so the turn is refused rather than run |
| `messaging/display_safety.py` | `strip_ansi` / `canonicalize_display` / `redact_for_display` scan the literal bytes and five display forms: the canonical one-level link grammar shared with Slack, Telegram, WhatsApp and iMessage; Telegram's plain fallback; a depth-unbounded CommonMark balanced close; a lazy first-`)` close; and a link-free reading that leaves every url visible while consuming native links, emphasis and format characters. The extra readings only add redaction and do not widen renderer link syntax. Emitted text settles under every reading or loses display markup outside exact redactor-owned credential tags and safe-domain suspicious-URL tags. `joins_to_a_credential`, `severs_a_credential`, and `safe_split_offset` grade one boundary, an n-piece delivery, and candidate cuts; `present` maps pieces to the sink-delivered form and both raw and presented forms are graded because neither dominates. |
| `messaging/markup.py` | `strip_thinking_tags` / `flatten_pipe_tables` / `flatten_mermaid_body`: Markdown reductions for a surface that renders none of the source form (a `<thinking>` block, a pipe table needing a monospace grid, a `mermaid` fence needing an image). Emits Markdown, never a channel dialect, so each channel's own inline converter finishes the job. Stdlib-only leaf |
| `messaging/split.py` | `split_markdown_safe` — the shared fence-safe markdown splitter (stdlib-only, pure). Prefix-stable so streaming callers can send sealed chunks and keep only the last as a live buffer. `split_markdown_bytes` wraps it for a byte-capped platform, measuring the produced chunks and shrinking the character budget until they fit, with the `chunk_utf8_bytes` primitive as the floor. Also exports `iter_fence_spans`, the same fence machine viewed as character spans over a whole message, and `split_markdown_safe_with_tier`, which additionally declares whether the split entered the context-degrading tier (a cut that leaves a dirty remainder, so the deferred text can read as a delimiter the source line never contained). |
| `messaging/outbound_files.py` | `extract_local_refs` (+ `extract_local_refs_off_loop`) — pulls local markdown image references out of an outbound reply into `OutboundFile` payloads carrying the validated bytes, with `Rejection` reasons for everything refused. Also `iter_local_refs` / `hide_local_refs`, the text-only scan a streaming channel uses to keep the markup off live frames. Channel-neutral; the upload stays per-transport |
| `messaging/raster.py` | `sniff_raster_mime` — what counts as a raster, decided by leading bytes. Dependency-free (no `kiro_crew` imports) so both the inbound sniff and the outbound extractor can share it |
| `messaging/tables.py` | `render_tables` + the `off`/`cards`/`grid`/`native`/`auto` policy contract and `display_width` — outbound Markdown-table rendering for a target that shows a pipe table as literal pipes (stdlib-only, pure) |
| `messaging/status_reactions.py` | `PhaseReactionLadder` plus the turn-status line (`format_turn_status`): debounced phase-to-emoji swapping over an injected `ReactionSink`, a stall watchdog, tool-to-phase classification, and `merge_phase_emojis` for a user's overrides. Owns no channel API and no emoji vocabulary |
| `messaging/commands.py` | The channel-neutral half of the shared chat commands — `/stop`'s cancel + lock ordering (`stop_running_turn`), `/yolo`'s grant ladder (`run_yolo_command`), and the dashboard-link TTL vocabulary (`parse_dashboard_ttl` / `format_ttl`). Returns reply TEXT and takes no address of any kind; `stop_running_turn` is the one exception and sends through an injected `deliver`, because its compaction decline may only arm an escalation once the warning has landed. Also the path-independent keyword commands as one copy of their reply text — `spawn`/`bg`, `cron list|remove|pause|resume`, `task run|status|cancel`, each `(text, service) -> reply | None` where `None` means "not this command, keep routing" (the `spawn` and `cron`/`task` families are `async`, because their service touch is a task-store or cron-store write and every caller is a channel handler on the gateway loop — `_spawn_off_loop` prefers `SubagentManager.spawn_async`). NOT the runtime stats line: both channels call `Stats().summary()` directly, because a one-liner with no parsing and no service to duck-type gains nothing from a shared copy. `spawn_task_reply` / `cron_remove_all_reply` are the already-parsed forms a channel whose own grammar carries the prefix calls. The services are duck-typed under `TYPE_CHECKING` because `subagent` and `taskrunner` both reach `slack` transitively |
| `messaging/sessions_view.py` | The channel-neutral recent-sessions collector (`_collect_recent_sessions` + its off-loop form). Takes an explicit `sessions_dir` so a surface owning its own data-home override threads it in rather than shadowing this module's; `slack/sessions_view.py` does exactly that and keeps the Block Kit rendering |
| `messaging/privacy_mode.py` | The `!temporary` / `!incognito` session privacy modes, keyed by **session key** — two bounded LRUs, the durable `SessionMap` flag, one `is_restricted` predicate, the token strippers, and the SEL audit with the channel as a parameter. See [Session privacy modes](#session-privacy-modes-privacy_modepy) |
| `messaging/auto_title.py` | Conversation auto-titling — the claim-early LRU, the tool-free bounded background turn, the prompt, and the title-cleaning rules. Renaming the platform conversation is a caller-supplied callback. See [Auto-titling](#auto-titling-auto_titlepy) |
| `messaging/upload_gate.py` | `session_is_restricted(dashboard_state, session_key, persisted_probe=, unknown_denies=True)` — the shared incognito/temporary decision, `session_blocks_reads(...)` — its READ counterpart (only `temporary` blocks reads; `incognito` still reads), plus `uploads_restricted(...)` which adds the per-channel upload audit, plus `live_dashboard_slot`. Three-state ladder (non-`dashboard:` key answers off `privacy_mode`, a LIVE slot answers off `is_restricted`/`blocks_reads`, otherwise the PERSISTED transcript mode answers). `unknown_denies` decides an unreadable mode: uploads DENY it outright (bytes cannot be recalled), while the durable-history gate denies only when a transcript EXISTS but its mode cannot be resolved (an ambiguous stem, a header no normal session wrote) — that is where an incognito session can hide. A legacy header with no `memory_mode` reads `persistent` rather than unknown, so the only unknown history allows is a truly ABSENT record, where nothing on disk claims the session is restricted. Discord and Telegram both route uploads here; both resumed-turn paths also use it to gate live projection and durable history, and Telegram uses it for `/title` |
| `messaging/session_trust.py` | The per-session tool-Trust grant store: `is_session_trusted`, `add_trusted_session(key, sessions=, strict=)`, `clear_trusted_sessions`. In memory only, so an ad-hoc auto-approve grant dies with the process. The grant has TWO halves and both are load-bearing: the in-memory mapping the driver reads, and the session's approval policy set to `auto`, because a spawned subagent reads its parent's policy and never this mapping. So it is a `key -> SessionManager` MAPPING rather than a set, which is what lets `clear_trusted_sessions` undo the policy half too (back to `""`, the same value the dashboard's untrust toggle writes) without its caller having to hand a manager back. **Every mutation goes through the API**: reaching the container directly is how a revoke came to drop one half and leave subagents trusted, and a mapping has no `.add`, so a half-grant is not expressible either. `strict=True` is for a caller that reports the grant back to the person who clicked (the Slack linked-approval Trust button): a failing policy write undoes the in-memory half and raises, so a PARTIAL grant is never labelled "Trusted"; the default stays best-effort for callers with nobody to tell. Named `session_trust`, not `trust`, so it cannot be confused with a connection-admission roster: this grant is about what ONE session's tools may skip, not about which principals may attach. Consumed only through `TurnDriver`'s `auto_approve_session` predicate, which runs BEHIND the keystone, governance and deny-list gates, so a hard DENY still refuses |
| `messaging/spawn_approval_delivery.py` | The channel-neutral spawn-approval delivery seam: a process-global registry (`register_channel_delivery` / `unregister_channel_delivery` / `resolve_channel_delivery` / `deliver_spawn_approval` / `unpressed_wait_answer` / `clear_channel_delivery_hooks`) keyed by channel namespace. The single host-wide `on_spawn_approval` callback (`slack/gateway.py`) consults `deliver_spawn_approval` FIRST so a spawn parented on a live channel conversation is answered where the human already is, on that channel's own Approve/Deny/Trust keyboard. A hook returns `True`/`False` (the user's decision, used verbatim) or `None` (no hook for this channel, or it could not surface the prompt) to fall through to the Slack-DM/dashboard gate. Same inversion `session_trust` uses — `messaging` may not import a channel package, so the hook is a plain async callable the channel supplies. In memory only (a hook is a live object on a running dispatcher; the registry dies with the process and a channel re-registers on startup). See [Channel-neutral spawn-approval delivery](#channel-neutral-spawn-approval-delivery-spawn_approval_deliverypy) |
| `messaging/link.py` | **Layer 3** — session-key namespacing (`session_key`/`canonical_key`/`legacy_key`/`is_legacy_slack_key`) + `ChannelLink` + DM-scope key derivation / `should_rotate_generation`, plus the in-channel `/link` ⇄ `/unlink` pair (`rebind_conversation_location` / `release_conversation_location`) |
| `messaging/conversation.py` | `ConversationState` — per-conversation rotating *generation* bookkeeping (advanced by `/new` and idle/daily reset), seeded from the persisted session map |
| `messaging/inbound_spool.py` | The durable spool for an inbound message the SHUTDOWN GATE refused, and its boot-time replay. See [Durable inbound spool](#durable-inbound-spool-inbound_spoolpy) |
| `messaging/session_resume.py` | **Layer 3** — the channel-neutral half of dashboard-session resume. `SessionResumeController` consumes a bound `ResumeSurface` (including its exact durable expectation identity, which may be narrower than `ChannelLink.channel_id`) and owns the complete SHOW-PICKER flow (eligibility/search, audit, nonce/TTL/owner/message scoping, and registration only after a successful post) plus the CHOOSE/BIND transaction (history existence, conflict checks around the awaited settlement, durable expectation before success, atomic inbound claim, lost-claim/storage outcomes, dashboard push, and audit). `SessionBinder` owns inbound routing, settlement, and release. It also owns the two conversation-log reads each adapter used to spell for itself — `persisted_session_agent(conv_log, session_key)` and `session_title_of(conv_log, session_key, channel=)` — both SYNCHRONOUS, because metadata access blocks and the async caller owns the `asyncio.to_thread` offload; `channel` only names the call site in its debug line. Discord, Telegram, and Teams retain only address/identity derivation, widgets/cards, exact wording and display redaction, callback parsing, and channel-local replay. |
| `messaging/resume_expectation.py` | The durable conversation-keyed shadow of those bindings, ONE file per channel (`store_filename`), because a Discord channel id and a Teams conversation id are unrelated address spaces |
| `dashboard/channel_handoff.py` (dashboard-side, reached by a channel through a deferred import) | `hand_to_resumed_slot(state, session_key, text, mode=, has_attachments=, channel_type=, conversation_id=, principal=)` — the channel-neutral hand-off of a mid-turn message into a RESUMED dashboard session's own slot machinery: the slot's steer path (recording the same audience fence the peer-steer path records) or the slot's queue (drained by the dashboard turn loop, stamped user- and channel-origin, and with the sending conversation as the drop-notice recipient), never the channel's own queue. Answers `steered` / `queued` (the audience-fence cap sends a steer to the queue instead of refusing), or `refused` with a `REFUSED_*` reason the channel words — no open slot, a closing or remote-bound slot, a slot that is not itself driving the turn, attachments, a slot that moved under the steer RPC with no record holding the delivery id or with the id held only in memory on a closing slot, or a live queue at `MAX_LIVE_QUEUE_ENTRIES`. An incognito or temporary session is taken like any other: those modes keep their transcript and queue (decision 2026-09-25). |
| `teams/service_urls.py` | `ServiceUrlStore` — durable `conversation_id -> serviceUrl` (plus the authorized identity owning each conversation), because the Bot Framework offers no lookup and a lost reference leaves every proactive path with nowhere to send. `forget` drops a route the Connector permanently refuses |
| `teams/cards.py` | Adaptive Card construction + `parse_submit` — the strict, total validation of an untrusted card payload. Mints no nonce of its own: every clickable widget's token comes from `messaging.renderer.new_approval_nonce` |
| `teams/approvals.py` | `TeamsApprovalDecider` — awaits one Approve / Approve+auto-approve / Deny click, deny-by-default on every non-answer. Holds NO grant: the button's press is recorded and the dispatcher arms the shared process-wide grant through `messaging.commands.run_yolo_command` |
| `teams/session_resume.py` | Teams' half: the Adaptive Card picker, its display redaction, and the owner rule — which is STRICTER than Discord's for a reason (see the Teams section) |
| `teams/attachments.py` | Teams' file halves — the two inbound shapes with OPPOSITE fetch auth, the inline-image outbound policy, and `quoted_reply_text` (a 1:1 quote-reply's own words, which `activity.text` does not carry cleanly) |
| `slack/transport.py` | Slack reference `MessagingTransport` (`SlackTransport`) over `SlackClientOps` |
| `slack/renderer.py` | Slack reference `Renderer` (`SlackRenderer`) + `SlackApprovalDecider` + `build_approval_blocks` |
| `slack/transport_dispatch.py` | `handle_message_transport()` — full new-path dispatch wiring the three layers together |
| `telegram/transport_dispatch.py` + `telegram/dispatch/` | `TelegramDispatcher` and the owners it is composed from — see [Telegram's dispatcher composition](#telegrams-dispatcher-composition) |

## Layer 1 — `MessagingTransport` (`transport.py`)

Channel-neutral inbound/outbound contract. A new channel = implement this interface + an inbound adapter, with zero change to the shared turn-handling core.

- **Class attributes**: `channel_type: str` (e.g. `"slack"`) and a `capabilities: TransportCapabilities`.
- **Tier-1 core (abstract)**: `send_message(conversation_id, content, thread_id=None) -> str` (returns a platform message id), `resolve_conversation(user_id) -> str` (the `open_dm` equivalent), `fetch_history(conversation_id, thread_id=None) -> list[InboundMessage]`.
- **Lifecycle (default no-op, override as needed)**: `connect()` (lazy-import client libs HERE), `maintain()` (poll/heartbeat), `disconnect()`.
- **Inbound adapter (abstract)**: `receive(raw_envelope)` (ack → filter → authorize → normalize → dispatch) and `authorize(msg) -> bool`. `authorize` MUST be **deny-by-default** — an unconfigured transport authorizes nobody.
- **Outbound authorization**: `may_send_to(conversation_id, thread_id=None, *, principal="") -> bool` re-decides recipient authorization for a **proactive** send. `authorize` gates a turn the user drove; this gates the messages nobody asked for (a cron result, a compaction notice, a subagent completion), which resolve their destination from a *persisted* `ChannelLink`. A link records a conversation but **does not re-check the roster that admitted it**, so without this a recipient removed from a channel's allow-list kept receiving proactive traffic after a restart: the roster changed and nothing re-read it. Only the transport can answer, because the roster holds principals while the link holds a conversation id and whether those are the same string is a per-platform fact. `principal` carries the peer's platform id when the session key names one, or — when the key names nobody — the peer the gateway admitted on the link (`ChannelLink.principal`), handed in only when the row's gateway-minted admission verifies (`ChannelLink.admission`, § Proactive sends) and the transport's own record of the conversation (`direct_peer_of`, below), if it has one, agrees; that is what lets a transport with an opaque conversation id (Discord, Webex) reach its roster at all. Empty means nothing names a single person the gateway or the transport can vouch for (a room route, a unified bucket bound in-channel, an unsigned or rewritten row), NOT that nobody is authorized. MUST stay **synchronous and in-memory**, because it runs on every proactive send: a network round trip there is unbounded work on the send path, and a check that can time out is a check that fails open under load. See § Proactive sends for where it is enforced and which channels answer how.
- **Resume-target authorization**: `may_resume_from(conversation_id, thread_id=None) -> bool` applies target- and roster-specific ownership after `supports_session_resume` proves the transport has a correct inbound resolver. The default follows the capability. Telegram narrows it to exactly one configured operator's private DM, so a multi-user allow-list can still receive an outbound dashboard mirror without granting either user inbound control of that dashboard session. The dashboard asks this once after resolving the configured target and threads the answer unchanged through both its occupancy precheck and binding write. It is synchronous and in-memory for the same reason as `may_send_to`.
- **DM peer attestation**: `direct_peer_of(conversation_id) -> str` names the ONE human in a conversation when the transport can attest **from its own state** that it is a 1:1 direct conversation and whose — the DM it opened for that person (`resolve_conversation`) or one an authorized message arrived from — and answers `""` for a room, a thread, a group, an id this process never placed, or a transport that keeps no such record. Default `""`, which is the fail-closed answer: a transport that does not override it confirms nothing. Its reader is the per-send recipient leg of the cross-surface send ladder (`chat_runner._recipient_principal`, § Proactive sends), as defense in depth over the gateway-admitted record: a persisted mirror `ChannelLink` records a conversation id and, when its writer could name one, the peer it was admitted for (`ChannelLink.principal`) under a MAC only the gateway can mint (`ChannelLink.admission`), and the ladder hands `may_send_to` that peer only when the MAC verifies AND this hook, if it names anyone for the conversation, names the same person. The hook names the peer and decides nothing about authorization; the roster does. Discord answers from the `create_dm_channel` / inbound-DM / button-press pairing its client records (`cached_dm_recipient`, the same record the mid-send re-check decides on, so a DM opened before a restart reads `""` until re-opened or written into — which the ladder treats as no contradiction of the admitted record, so the recipient leg admits the mirror across a restart; only the REST ladder's own mid-send re-check, which reads the pairing alone, can still refuse a send that WAITS before the pairing is re-learned). Telegram inherits the default: its `may_send_to` decides a DM from the conversation id, which IS the user id, so no attestation changes its answer. Synchronous and in-memory like the two hooks above, because it runs inside gates that must not suspend.

#### Authorization across a send's own waits

`may_send_to` is the most recent reading only while no time passes between it and the write. A REST ladder that suspends itself breaks that: the last point a caller can read is immediately before the `await`, and every caller already does, so a destination withdrawn during the wait is delivered to by the attempt that follows. The ladder is the only place that knows a wait happened, so the re-read belongs there — one contract per channel rather than a copy per caller, the same reasoning that put the `channels` ceiling at the messaging seam.

**Discord implements it; the other channels have the same shape and are not yet adopted.** `DiscordClient` serves four internal waits (a pre-emptive bucket hold to `_MAX_PREEMPT_SECS`, a 429 back-off to `_MAX_RETRY_AFTER_SECS`, a global hold to `_MAX_GLOBAL_HOLD_SECS`, and the 5xx/connector back-off), and each is paired with a re-read before the attempt after it. Two authorities answer, both fail closed, and a refusal ends the send as `DISCORD_BLOCKED` — never as transient, because re-driving it is exactly what the operator asked to stop:

- the operator's `channels` ceiling for the channel, which the client asks the messaging seam for through `channel_outbound_permitted`. Global to the channel, so it is answerable without a roster and is read even when no predicate is installed. It is the direction-aware twin of `channel_inbound_permitted` over the same `channels` allowlist, and it exists because a send and a received message are separate decisions: the row it leaves says `outbound:<channel>`. That name is its ONLY difference from the inbound twin; criticality matches too, so a governed ALLOW is written critically and an SEL that cannot record it degrades the answer to a refusal. A governed allow nobody can record is not an allow, and an egress decision is the one a reader needs most. A DENY stays best-effort, because the refusal already stands;
- the transport's live rosters, installed by `DiscordTransport` as the client's `still_permitted` predicate. Synchronous and in-memory for the same reason `may_send_to` is. The one cached thing it reads is the DM pairing (`cached_dm_recipient`); a channel's TYPE is deliberately NOT re-resolved, because resolving one would re-enter the ladder it guards, and because an id's membership is what moves while its type does not.

Every outcome is audited, allow as well as refusal. The decision is taken on an already-composed, user-visible message and the ladder's result carries it no further than its caller, so the SEL row naming the deciding authority is the record it leaves. Only a route that actually waited reaches the check, so the rows are paced by rate limits rather than by traffic.

The predicate retains exactly one thing, the DM pairing, and it is bounded: both ids must fit a snowflake's length and the store carries a named cap and evicts least-recently-used, with a read refreshing recency so a pairing in active use does not age out and then be refused. Reaching that cap is counted and audited with the id it forgot, and a later refusal of that id says it was the cap rather than a roster edit, because the two are indistinguishable to whoever is reading the log and only one of them is a policy change. That accounting record is itself capped, far below the pairing store, and decides no send - it selects an audit reason. Nothing else is retained, because a refusing final arm answers every id a roster and a pairing cannot place, and a record of what was once admitted would reach that same refusal by a longer route. The pairing has one other reader, `DiscordTransport.direct_peer_of` (the contract hook above), which the cross-surface ladder's per-send recipient leg reads as defense in depth over the gateway-admitted record of a dashboard-born session's DM mirror; it reads the same store and inherits the same bounds, and an eviction there withdraws a contradiction rather than a delivery, since a pairing that is not on record leaves the verified record standing.

The route is classified before either authority is read, but only to settle **which id names the destination**: a route naming a channel in its path uses that, a route naming none uses the destination its **caller supplies** (a button press's own reply carries its destination in an opaque token, so the path cannot yield it while the dispatcher holds it directly), and a route naming neither reads nothing. When both name one the **path wins**, because that is where the bytes go; re-checking the caller's id instead would authorize one channel and write to another. Both authorities then apply to whichever id was settled on, and the **roster is read last**: the governance read is an `await`, so a roster reading taken before it describes a destination that may already have been withdrawn, which would rebuild this very defect one layer up. **Only an attempt that actually waited pays for any of this**, so a send that never blocks costs nothing.

Three arms decide everything a channel id can decide. Both CURRENT rosters are read first, so moving an id between `allowed_thread_ids` and `allowed_channel_ids` reads as the reclassification it is rather than as a withdrawal. Then a DM whose peer this process can name is decided on **that peer**. Then **anything left is refused**: an id on no roster is either withdrawn or never admitted, and both answer the same at an egress boundary. The pairing is learned wherever it is knowable: `create_dm_channel` knows it when the bot opens a DM, an authorized inbound DM names it, and so does an authorized DM interaction. Both inbound cases matter because the answer goes to the channel the message or press arrived on, without ever opening it. All of them record on the authorized path only, so a denied sender or presser cannot plant one.

That last arm is deliberate. A DM channel this process never opened - a destination read back from a persisted link - names nobody, and asking instead whether the roster admits ANYBODY would let one remaining peer authorize a different, revoked one. At a network egress boundary "cannot tell" reads as no. Each refusal reports WHICH of the three it is, because only the rosters can tell them apart and only the caller reports them: a destination an authority can place and no longer admits is a withdrawal, one nothing can place says exactly that instead, and a predicate that raised means the check itself never answered. All three stop the send; reporting any of them as a withdrawal sends whoever is debugging a dropped notification after a policy change that never happened. The cost is that an unattended proactive DM to such a channel is refused rather than delivered when it serves one of the ladder's waits; a caller that needs it to survive re-opens the DM through `create_dm_channel`, which establishes the pairing. Reading a pairing's PRESENCE as proof that an id is a DM channel is what lets the middle arm be that short, so every writer of one is reachable only for a direct message: `create_dm_channel` POSTs the route that can return nothing else, and both inbound writers sit under a `guild_id` gate. That is pinned structurally as well as behaviourally, because it is a claim about writers not yet added. A button press is re-authorized after its acknowledgement as well: the rosters are read once before the ack, the ack serves the ladder's waits, and the governance read after it is off-loop, so the user and thread rosters are read again before the press resolves anything. An explicit reject still lands, because a denial is what a withdrawal wants. Its CONFIRMATION does not follow automatically: writing the verdict back is outbound traffic, the reject reaches it without that re-read, and the edit may serve no wait at all, so nothing else would judge it - both authorities are read once more before the verdict is written, the ceiling through its OUTBOUND entry point because the write is this process's own egress, and the rosters last. The verdict is identical either way over one `channels` allowlist; what the direction buys is the row's name, and an egress refusal filed as an ingress one is unreadable to whoever later asks why a message did not go out. The gate before the press RESOLVES stays inbound, because what it decides is an arriving press. A channel the ceiling no longer permits receives NO edit, whichever verdict it would have carried and whether or not the press was a reject: the card is an ordinary channel message posted while that channel was still permitted, so writing nothing leaves it exactly as the operator last allowed it, while replacing its text names a tool and its outcome into a destination that is no longer permitted. The decision is resolved before this point, so a withheld edit costs the presser a confirmation and never the decision. The ceiling is read again here even on the arm that already read it before resolving, rather than carrying that answer forward, because a value taken before a suspension is the defect this whole section exists to close; on an ungoverned install the read permits without recording a row, so the second reading costs a row only where an operator asked for the audit trail.

The re-read after the acknowledgement takes the authorities in the same order the send ladder does, the ceiling first and the rosters LAST, for the same reason: the ceiling read is an `await`, so a roster reading taken before it describes a state that can have changed by the time anything resolves.

Two replies are exempt from the caller-supplied destination, and the exemption is the point rather than an omission: a notice that ANNOUNCES a refusal must not be gated by the authority it is announcing. The outbound ceiling reads the same `channels` allowlist that just denied the command, and the roster refuses the very channel the other notice is explaining, so passing a destination would make both undeliverable in the one case they exist for and leave the user with the platform's own "did not respond" error. Both are ephemeral - addressed to the presser, never posted into the channel - so nothing the ceiling governs is disclosed. Which sites those are is pinned by their own text, so the exemption cannot drift onto a different call, and a new call site still has to carry a destination.

### `TransportCapabilities`

Declares what a channel can do. Defaults are deliberately conservative (the WhatsApp-like floor) so a transport that forgets to declare a capability degrades safely rather than over-promising.

| Field | Default | Notes |
|-------|---------|-------|
| `streaming` | `False` | feature flag |
| `edit` | `False` | feature flag |
| `reactions` | `False` | feature flag |
| `files_inbound` | `False` | feature flag — the two directions land per channel and in different changes, so ONE `files` boolean was undecidable and got the wrong answer for one of them |
| `files_outbound` | `False` | ENFORCED — gates whether a renderer extracts and uploads a local image reference. Declaring `False` keeps printing the path, which is the honest degradation |
| `rich_blocks` | `False` | ENFORCED — gates whether a renderer attaches a native widget at all (Webex reads it for both the approval Adaptive Card and an `[OPTIONS:]` card). Declaring `False` keeps the numbered-text and typed-reply forms, so it decides whether a widget APPEARS, never whether the user can answer |
| `threads` | `False` | feature flag |
| `table_mode` | `off` | outbound table presentation: `off` / `cards` / `grid` / `native` / `auto`; read only by renderers that use `render_tables_for_target` |
| `native_tables` | `False` | the target renders a GFM pipe table AS a table; checked before `native` may pass through |
| `supports_session_resume` | `False` | ENFORCED — gates whether a dashboard connect marks the binding as an inbound resume target (`direction: both`). Only a transport whose inbound path resolves the mirror binding may declare it |
| `max_message_chars` | `4096` | quantitative — Slack 3900, Telegram 4096, Discord 2000, Teams 16000, WhatsApp 4096. A CHARACTER count: a byte-capped platform must declare a value safe at its worst-case bytes-per-char (Webex and Teams are pinned in `test_capability_ledger.py`) |
| `max_message_bytes` | `0` | quantitative — the platform's REAL budget when its cap is denominated in UTF-8 BYTES, which `chunk_for_transport` measures against instead of the character floor. `0` means "no byte cap" and is the honest default: a char-capped transport that declared one would chunk against a unit it does not have, and a byte-capped transport that omits it merely keeps the 4x-pessimistic `bytes // 4` char floor. Webex and WeCom declare it -- the two platforms whose cap is denominated in RAW bytes of the text field. Teams and Feishu are byte-capped on the `ensure_ascii=False` SERIALIZED form instead (a quote costs 2 bytes there, a C0 control 6), so no raw-byte constant bounds what their wires measure and both stay at `0` on the char floor by classification, not by omission. `test_capability_ledger.py` pins all ten transports in three groups: raw-byte cap, serialized-transform cap, char-capped |
| `max_buttons` | `3` | TOTAL interactive choices per prompt (the WhatsApp Business Cloud API's reply-button cap, which is where the default came from; the personal-account WhatsApp channel this repo ships declares 0); enforced via `apply_options_cap` -- overflow degrades to a numbered text list |
| `mention_grammars` | `True` | ENFORCED — whether the platform parses a broadcast-mention grammar (`@everyone`, Slack's `<!channel>`) in a message body. `messaging.renderer.display_safe_for` reads it at the channel-NEUTRAL proactive sinks and applies the zero-width-space defang only where one exists. Default `True` because the directions are asymmetric: a needless defang mangles text cosmetically, a missing one lets a prompt-injected `@everyone` mass-notify. Webex declares `False` — no broadcast grammar, and its allow-list IS email addresses, so the defang makes every address the agent prints uncopyable |
| `supports_proactive_send` | `True` | send-policy (the WhatsApp Business Cloud API is `False` outside its 24h window; the personal-account channel here has no such window and declares `True`) |
| `returns_message_id` | `True` | ENFORCED — whether `send_message` answers with a real id, so a caller may read an EMPTY id as "refused". WeCom's proactive command and Feishu's reply carry none, so for them `""` is the SUCCESS value and failure RAISES; both declare `False`. Asked through `delivery_confirmed(capabilities, message_id)`, never re-derived per call site |

`to_dict()` serializes all fields. The integer *parameters* (not booleans) capture where channels differ quantitatively so the `Renderer` can chunk / degrade rather than assume a single shape.

**A proactive send is CHUNKED against the transport's own cap, then confirmed part
by part.** A transport caps by SLICING (Telegram's `_cap_text` at 4096) and still
answers with a message id, so handing it a longer message loses the tail and reports
success — which the caller then audits as a completed delivery. The legs in
`dashboard/messaging_api/channel_delivery.py` split first and stop on the first unconfirmed part,
since the remaining chunks of a message whose head never landed would arrive as an
orphaned fragment. Those legs and the gateway's keep separate loops deliberately: they
split plain text and the gateway's splits markdown with fence sealing, so collapsing
them would silently retune one of the two.

**A send that did not raise is not automatically a delivery.** `delivery_confirmed`
(`messaging/transport.py`) is the one predicate the proactive-send call sites
ask — `slack/gateway.py`'s channel reply leg and the three legs in
`dashboard/messaging_api/channel_delivery.py`. Most transports report a refused or exhausted
send by returning an empty id rather than raising, and that return value is
load-bearing: cron stands its Slack fallback down and advances its dedup hash on a
confirmed delivery, so one false success loses the result on every surface at once.
The two id-less transports invert it — applying the empty-id test to them reports
every delivered cron result as lost, leaves the dedup hash unadvanced, and repeats
the same result on the next tick. Which is why the reason lives in the predicate:
it had been written out at each call site, and the copy that forgot the second
convention was the one that shipped. `test_channel_transport_outbound_authz.py`
pins the declaration against each transport's own `send_message` by AST, in both
directions, so a transport cannot declare a convention it does not follow.

### `InboundMessage`

Normalized, channel-agnostic inbound message: `channel_type`, `user_id`, `conversation_id`, `text`, `thread_id=None`, `attachments=[]`, `is_mention=False`, `person_origin=False`; `to_dict()` for serialization.

`person_origin` is set by a transport's `receive` on a message a PERSON sent, and by the dispatcher on one it rebuilds for a person (a button press, a slash command). A message the gateway composed itself — an auto-nudge or monitor wake, built by `build_inbound` — leaves it False, which is what keeps that wake out of the person lane. A wake can reach the busy-queue path too (a person's turn starts between the gateway's busy check and its dispatch), so a queued entry records its own message's flag (`queue_drain.person_tag`, the neutral `queued_person_origin` key) and the drain replays a collapsed turn with `person_origin` true exactly when one of its entries recorded it (`entry_person_origin`; absent reads False). The replay sets it on the envelope it returns, not only on a fallback base: that envelope is built on the finished turn's inbound, whose flag belongs to whoever opened that turn. The dispatchers turn it into the turn's start priority (`person_priority`; [acp-client](acp-client.md) § Start priority).

## Layer 2 — `TurnDriver` (`driver.py`)

Consumes a provider's `AcpEvent` stream and emits abstract `OutputEvent`s to a per-transport `Renderer`. It owns the channel-neutral turn concerns — credential/exfiltration redaction and the tool-approval decision — so every channel inherits them once.

**Redaction and protocol framing** — before text reaches a renderer, `TurnDriver` first classifies a reserved summary-bearing compaction notice at the start of the turn, then incrementally parses kiro-cli's inline `[STEERING steer-<id>: …]` frame across arbitrary chunk boundaries. Compaction summary bodies become the terse `✅ Context compacted.` receipt. Steering frames never become text: they emit one structured `STEER_CONSUMED` event at the exact boundary (paired with kiro-cli's typed lifecycle event regardless of arrival order). The user-facing `[OPTIONS: …]` trailer is deliberately not part of this filter and passes through unchanged for renderer-native buttons. After framing, `_redact()` runs `redact_exfiltration_urls()` then `redact_credentials()` (both from `security.py`) over every text chunk, thinking chunk, tool title/purpose, and each string field of prompt-choice options before it reaches a renderer.

The dashboard does **not** flow through `TurnDriver`; it remains unchanged as the authoritative transcript surface. Direct channel paths that bypass the driver are sanitized at source: Discord's explicit five-message resume replay strips legacy steering frames and summary-bearing compaction notices, shortens each entry to the shared splitter's first (sealed) chunk so a replayed code block cannot arrive with its fence cut in half, and puts the role icon on its own line so the body's first line still starts where the fence grammar needs it; direct compact commands publish only terse receipts. Stored transcripts remain intact for audit.

**Session-directive consumption** — an optional `directive_consumer` callback (`(kind, args) -> awaitable`) makes the driver the channel-side consumer of the stateless session-directive protocol (`session_directive.py`): the trusted `_meta.kiro` identity is resolved by the shared forgery-gate predicate (`session_directive.directive_tool_for(mcp_server_name, tool_name)`, the same single spelling the dashboard consumer uses) and recorded at `EVENT_TOOL_CALL`, and the matching `EVENT_TOOL_RESULT`'s marker is decoded and handed to the consumer — single-consume across result frames, forged markers under any other tool ignored, `encode()` refusals logged, a lost marker on the final frame logged at WARNING. A tool call announced as a NATIVE sub-agent's (`EVENT_SUBAGENT_ACTIVITY` with a `tool_call_id`) is refused with a SEL `denied` audit rather than applied — a child session must never arm/mutate its parent, mirroring the dashboard consumer's isolation. Dispatchers inject `messaging.dispatch.build_directive_consumer(session_key=…, sessions=…, dispatcher=…)`, which funnels into the same `apply_session_directive` core the dashboard consumer uses with `slot=None` (so card-producing dashboard-only directives stay refused for channel turns). Channel `set_project` writes the durable per-conversation project/CWD override; because its tool result arrives while the current provider still owns the turn semaphore, the provider is not killed in place. The next claimant acquires the old semaphore, replaces that provider, and cold-starts in the new CWD before sending its prompt. Legacy prompt loops take effect where the session is nudge-able (`slack:`/`discord:`/`webex:`). Structured monitor creation is narrower: dashboard, Slack, and Discord have typed dispatch plus completion correlation, while Webex is refused before a structured record is armed. On the other five transports (Telegram, iMessage, Teams, WeCom, Weixin) the applier likewise answers "not supported from this session type" — logged and SEL-audited instead of the old silent drop. Being on either list takes both an admitted binding and the matching fire contract; otherwise a loop can report itself healthy before dying on its first cycle. Without a consumer, directive markers are inert exactly as before.

**`run(message) -> str`** — calls `renderer.on_turn_start()`, then translates each provider event into a dispatched `OutputEvent` and returns the accumulated (redacted) assistant text:

| Provider event | Emitted `OutputEvent` |
|----------------|-----------------------|
| `EVENT_TEXT_CHUNK` | `TEXT_CHUNK` (protocol-framed, redacted, accumulated); inline steering frames become `STEER_CONSUMED`, compaction summary notices become a terse receipt |
| `EVENT_THINKING_CHUNK` | `THINKING` |
| `EVENT_STEER_CONSUMED` | paired with the inline frame so exactly one `STEER_CONSUMED` boundary reaches the renderer |
| `EVENT_TOOL_CALL` | `TOOL_CALL` (uniform — each call completes the prior task + starts a new one); records the directive-tool identity when a `directive_consumer` is injected |
| `EVENT_TOOL_RESULT` | nothing rendered; decodes + applies a session-directive marker via the injected `directive_consumer` (inert without one) |
| `EVENT_PERMISSION_REQUEST` | `PROMPT_CHOICE` (interactive w/ decider only) then approve/reject |
| `EVENT_COMPACTION_STATUS` | `COMPACTION` |
| `EVENT_COMPLETE` | `DONE` |

An optional structured-monitor completion hook is orthogonal to rendering. It
revalidates the persisted `(monitor_id, fingerprint)` claim after
`renderer.on_turn_start()` and immediately before the provider stream begins.
Channel monitor adapters also inject the synchronous SessionManager
`begin_turn` gate after that authorization and before marking the hook accepted;
the gate and stream entry have no intervening await, so a gateway shutdown that
began after the session lease was claimed refuses the wake instead of opening a
turn outside the shutdown drain snapshot. The checks and stream entry have no
intervening await; refusal returns without
entering the provider, recording a successful turn, or persisting/mirroring the
revoked wake, and does not mark the hook accepted. If channel context building,
conversation lookup, or dashboard rehydration observes that the structured claim
has already been stopped and therefore cannot construct its completion hook, the
adapter returns `UNAVAILABLE` before dispatch rather than falling through to the
ordinary/legacy turn path. Dashboard performs the
equivalent final check after any unattended background-turn permit and before
appending the wake or entering its runner. The hook is invoked exactly from the
`EVENT_COMPLETE` branch when its reason is safe completion evidence, before
buffered output, steering, redaction, or `DONE` is flushed to the renderer, with
the event's `TurnUsage` and a disposition derived from its stop reason. ACP's
stale-stream compatibility completion reuses `end_turn`, so that reason remains
uncharged until the event carries provenance that distinguishes it from a provider
result. Completion accounting therefore survives failure or cancellation during
renderer finalization. A normal handler return, command intercept, stream exception,
or ACP-synthesized terminal does not manufacture completion evidence. Callback
failure is logged and cannot
change the channel turn's output or error behavior. The hook is absent from ordinary inbound turns
and legacy AutoNudge turns. Slack reports a raw completion before its cancellable,
best-effort analytics usage-row write. If shutdown cancellation lands after the
raw event but before the driver returns, the adapter reports the captured
completion once before propagating cancellation, so an accepted wake cannot remain
in flight. A shutdown refusal before stream entry is transient `BUSY`, not terminal
`UNAVAILABLE`, and retries the durable claim after restart. Directive consumption
occurs before a later raw `EVENT_COMPLETE`, so an action that calls `monitor_stop`
or the structured `autonudge_stop` alias first makes its monitor inactive with a
durable `user_stop` outcome while retaining only the current wake correlation. The
turn-start hook records that acceptance synchronously in runtime state because the
outer dispatcher cannot persist `DISPATCHED` until the channel turn returns; this
marker distinguishes an accepted turn from a `BUSY` claim with the same unset
durable delivery field.
The completion hook then charges and clears that claim exactly once. Without safe
completion evidence the terminal record remains uncharged and cannot probe, re-arm,
or redispatch.

The structured monitor controller probes before entering any channel turn.
The authenticated creation surface is carried through native channel directives and
through linked dashboard-slot turns, including queued/recovered turns, then persisted
on the monitor. A merged queue batch retains channel provenance when any consumed item
came from a channel; dashboard input in the same batch cannot widen the entire turn.
Credential authority therefore follows the producer surface rather than the storage
slot key; linking a channel thread to a dashboard chat cannot promote that
channel-created monitor to dashboard owner credentials.
No-change, record-only, provider-retry, and terminal decisions therefore call
no messaging dispatcher and consume no model turn. For a newly actionable
fingerprint it persists the in-flight claim first, then supplies one redacted,
4,096-character-bounded `[Monitor wake]` envelope to the dashboard, Slack, or
Discord adapter without legacy cycle decoration. Each adapter returns the same
typed handoff: `DISPATCHED` starts the durable bounded completion-evidence
deadline, `BUSY` retries the already-claimed wake without another probe or model
turn, and `UNAVAILABLE` becomes a retained terminal outcome. A stream that ends
without raw `EVENT_COMPLETE` remains dispatched until its evidence deadline; it
never fabricates completion or immediately retries the same fingerprint.
Discord decides the structured result at its own dispatch boundary, not from the
scheduler's earlier advisory busy check: a concurrently busy session returns
`BUSY` without steering or queueing the wake, a refusal before the turn returns
`UNAVAILABLE`, and `DISPATCHED` is returned only after the claimed session has a
started `TurnDriver` carrying the matching completion hook. After its advisory
acceptance marker is set, a later Discord cleanup or dispatch exception remains
`DISPATCHED`; the durable completion-evidence deadline, rather than a contradictory
terminal-unavailable handoff, owns recovery for that accepted turn. After its advisory
check, Discord takes the SessionManager's non-waiting semaphore lease before
renderer setup, upload-policy lookup, typing, attachment work, or any other
pre-turn await. If a user turn wins that authoritative claim boundary, the
monitor returns `BUSY` immediately and creates no steer, queue entry, or
completion evidence. A structured wake also skips idle and daily generation
rotation after the gateway validates its session key, so the dispatcher claims
the exact generation that authorization approved. The gateway passes that key
through to the dispatcher, which rechecks it immediately before the non-waiting
session claim and refuses a generation changed by a concurrent `!new`. The
scheduler propagates that typed result unchanged. Discord repeats the same positive
generation check in the driver's closing gate after claim authorization and all
pre-stream awaits, so a later `!new` cannot send the wake into the abandoned session.
Slack rechecks the runtime inbound-channel policy before every structured wake,
because the policy can become stricter after monitor creation. After its advisory
busy check, Slack also takes the SessionManager's non-waiting semaphore claim; a
user turn that wins that boundary returns `BUSY` without waiting, starting a turn,
or creating completion evidence. A claimed Slack structured wake runs through
the same `TurnDriver` directive consumer as ordinary channel turns, so an
authenticated `monitor_update`, `monitor_stop`, or structured
`autonudge_stop` result is applied to that Slack session before a later raw
completion is accounted; legacy nudges retain their existing collector path.
If Slack's bounded timeout fires before the structured completion hook is
accepted, the claim is retryable and returns `BUSY`; after acceptance it remains
`DISPATCHED`, and the durable completion-evidence deadline owns recovery.
Discord applies the same bounded outer turn timeout to legacy nudges and
structured wakes, so a wedged dispatcher cannot hold the scheduler forever. A
timeout before the structured completion hook is accepted returns
`UNAVAILABLE`; a timeout after acceptance remains `DISPATCHED`, and the durable
completion-evidence deadline owns recovery for the correlated turn.

### The empty-turn verdict

`run()` returns `""` for four unlike endings: the backend closed the turn with a
terminal and streamed no text (a reasoning-only generation, a model that
returned an empty completion), the turn ran a tool and stopped without a closing
reply, an `error:`-family terminal the ACP layer synthesised, and a user cancel —
plus a stream that ended with no terminal at all. A renderer that keys only on
"is the body empty" cannot tell a reply that was never produced from a turn
whose text sealed in an earlier segment, and a dispatcher that files the user's
row and skips the assistant row leaves a transcript that ends on an unanswered
question with nothing to say why. That is how a turn that closed with nothing
rendered as the live `…` placeholder under a `Finished in …` footer and left no
trace.

So the driver, the one layer that sees the whole stream, states the verdict ONCE
(`messaging.driver.empty_turn_notice`) and both consumers read it: the renderer
receives it on the `DONE` event (`OutputEvent.notice`, exposed as
`Renderer.empty_turn_notice`) and posts it where its bare placeholder would
otherwise go, and the dispatcher reads `TurnDriver.empty_turn_notice` after
`run()` returns and persists the same sentence as a `notice` row
(`msg msg-info`, the dashboard runner's own class) behind the user's row —
mirrored into an open dashboard window first, through
`channel_slots.project_channel_row_live`, under the same row id the disk write
then uses. The two cannot disagree because neither derives its own. The verdict
is taken after the redactor flush, so it reads the same final text the renderer
was handed. The dispatcher normalizes the reply ONCE — whitespace alone (the
steer-boundary `"\n"`) is `""` — and hands that one value to the live projection
and the durable write, so neither files an assistant row the other skipped.

| Turn ending, no text | Verdict |
|---|---|
| terminal `end_turn` (or absent), no tool, no reasoning | `EMPTY_TURN_NOTICE` — "returned nothing this turn… just send your message again" |
| terminal `end_turn`, after a tool call or reasoning | `EMPTY_TURN_NOTICE_AFTER_WORK` — "ended without a closing reply… completed steps will not re-run" |
| `refusal` | `EMPTY_TURN_NOTICE_REFUSAL` — the model declined; rephrase (deterministic, so not "resend") |
| `error:*`, no tool, no reasoning | `EMPTY_TURN_NOTICE_ERROR` with a label from the closed map `_ERROR_STOP_LABELS` (`tool stall`, `compaction failed`); any other `error:` value — the family is open on the wire and a backend authors it — takes the generic `backend error`, so no wire string is ever interpolated into user-facing copy |
| `error:*`, after a tool call or reasoning | `EMPTY_TURN_NOTICE_ERROR_AFTER_WORK` — the same label, and the continue remedy: `tool stall` in particular is synthesised only after a tool ran, so its notice can never ask for a resend |
| stream ended without a terminal | the same flush trio the terminal branch runs (compaction filter, steering filter, stream redactor — the redactor withholds a whole trailing letter run, so a last chunk of `Done` is still in its buffer) runs first, so the verdict reads the real text and a reply that ended in an exhausted stream is delivered and recorded as a reply; only a genuinely textless exhaustion takes `EMPTY_TURN_NOTICE_UNCLOSED`, or `EMPTY_TURN_NOTICE_UNCLOSED_AFTER_WORK` when the turn did work — no `DONE` reached the renderer, so the dispatcher hands it one (`stop_reason="error"`, the verdict riding it) BEFORE it judges delivery: the bubble carries the same sentence the row records, and `delivery_failed` reads the fate of that send rather than a turn that had not yet tried to say anything |
| `cancelled` | `""` — the cancel is the answer; a notice would contradict it |
| any text at all | `""` |

The sentences live in `messaging/empty_turn_copy.py`, and the dashboard runner's
own empty-response card (`chat_runner`) reads the same constants, so a channel
thread mirrored into the dashboard reads one story — a pin test holds both
surfaces to the shared objects and to spelling neither remedy inline. Every
sentence tells the user what to DO, and the remedy is decided by whether the
turn did work first, on every branch but the refusal: a turn that ran nothing is
told to send its message again (the prompt has landed in the conversation, so
the remedy is to send, never to wait); a turn whose tool already ran is told to
continue from where it stopped, never to resend, because the resend runs the
side effect twice. The health counter is untouched — the turn
completed and its prompt is in the conversation, so `record_success` stands; the
notice is the outcome, not a fault. The notice is also the turn's ENTIRE
delivery, so it is accounted like one: the renderer counts the placeholder seal
in `delivery_failed`, and the dispatcher's undelivered predicate admits a turn
with a notice as it admits one with text — a notice Discord never took is
`record_failure`, not a success with an empty body. The `notice` row itself does
not close the turn for `is_turn_interrupted` (the shared dashboard predicate
skips every row that is not user, assistant or error), exactly as the dashboard
runner's own empty-turn card does not: Resume stays offered there, and Resume IS
the recovery the sentence names; what the record adds is the reason. Only
Discord adopts the verdict today; the shared `drive_turn` pipeline and the
Telegram renderer still show the bare `…` and persist the user row alone, and
adopting it there is the same two reads.

### Approval ladder

Four modes (constants, mirroring the native Slack + dashboard ladder):

| Constant | Value | Behavior in `_approve()` |
|----------|-------|--------------------------|
| `APPROVAL_AUTO` | `"auto"` | approve |
| `APPROVAL_TRUST` | `"trust"` | approve |
| `APPROVAL_TRUST_READS` | `"trust-reads"` | approve iff `event.tool_kind == "read"` |
| `APPROVAL_INTERACTIVE` | `"interactive"` | **deny-by-default** unless the injected `decider` approves |

Two injected predicates take precedence over the ladder (both checked per permission request, and both auto-approve immediately — no buttons, no decider wait):

- `auto_approve_tool: (permission_event) -> bool` — hook-driven auto-approve (e.g. `spawn_run` via the context builder's `auto_approve_subagent_spawn` hook). The predicate receives the whole PERMISSION EVENT — never just the title, which is model-authored — and keys on canonical identity only (`hooks.event_is_spawn_run`: `tool_name` == `spawn_run` with the `mcp_identity_trusted` provenance flag, served by `CORE_MCP_SERVER`; no title fallback — an event without canonical identity falls to the ladder below). Reason logged as `hook_auto_approve`.
- `auto_approve_session: () -> bool` — honors the auto-approve grant without the driver importing any channel module. Reason logged as `session_trust`. **Every shipped channel passes it**, and for a decider-less one it is the ONLY rung. Webex, WeCom, iLink (weixin), iMessage, Discord and Teams pass the same `() -> safety_override().is_active()`, the ONE process-global grant the dashboard toggle drives. Telegram passes `safety_override().is_active() or is_session_trusted(session_key)`, because it offers a Trust button and so needs the per-session grant as well; the grant it reads is the SHARED `messaging/session_trust` one, which is the distinction that matters here. Slack is the outlier, passing a narrower channel-local `is_slack_session_trusted`. **A new channel should follow the seven, not Slack.** A channel-local trusted set is a SECOND grant: its own lifetime, its own audit trail, and its own way to disagree with the dashboard about whether auto-approve is on — and "is YOLO on?" has to have one answer. Omitting the keyword entirely is not a neutral default either: it makes arming YOLO from the dashboard INERT on that channel, so an unattended run still stops on every tool prompt with nobody there to answer, which is how Discord shipped until it was enrolled.

**A `tool_gate` `"auto_approve"` verdict for a shell command is name-grant
verified before it is honoured.** The gate's hook grants by program NAME
(`auto_approve_tools` globs, the read-only allowlist), and the shell resolves
that name again through a `PATH` that can lead with agent-writable directories.
The driver therefore awaits `name_grant.refusal_for_event(event)` at the honour
point — the one place shared by every channel's gate, chosen because each
channel's `_tool_gate` is synchronous and loop-bound while the check does
filesystem work — and on a refusal DOWNGRADES to the ladder below (never a hard
block), logging `outcome=auto_approve_declined` with `reason=name_grant`, the
refusal code, and `tier=hook_auto_approve`. On Windows the check models the
shell's lookup and returns per-command verdicts as it does on POSIX, except in
two host states that still decline every name grant:
`windows_lookup_not_modelled` when Windows cannot report where the user's
Documents folder is, and `ambiguous_env` when a per-user PowerShell profile sits
at one of the paths derived from it. In those two states a channel turn without
a decider falls to deny-by-default for shell tools its `auto_approve_tools`
would otherwise grant. Non-shell verdicts and the two
full-trust predicates above are not name-based grants and are unchanged. The
`APPROVAL_TRUST_READS` rung is also unchanged and deliberately out of this
check's scope: it keys on `event.tool_kind`, never on a program name — a
kind-based grant with its own (weaker) trust model, unlike the dashboard's
trust-reads tier, which classifies the command by program name via
`is_read_only_bash` and is therefore name-grant verified there.

**Teams has a decider AND the shared predicate, and that combination is the
pattern.** It renders Adaptive Card approvals, so it passes a real `decider`; it
also passes the same `() -> safety_override().is_active()` the buttonless channels
do, because it keeps NO grant of its own. Its `/yolo` goes through the shared
`run_yolo_command`, and its card's middle button arms that identical grant through
the identical helper — so the command and the button cannot diverge, and neither can
disagree with the dashboard. The button is therefore labelled "Approve +
auto-approve" rather than "Trust session": the blast radius is every surface until
the grant expires, and a control has to say what it does. The label alone is not
enough, so the card body also carries `messaging.commands.YOLO_SCOPE_NOTE` — the one
sentence naming what the grant covers, shared with the reply `/yolo on` returns so a
pre-press affordance and the confirmation cannot describe different scopes.
"Auto-approve" on a button inside one chat otherwise reads as scoped to that chat.
Expiry, renewal, the duration and the SEL row all belong to the shared helper, which
is the point — a channel-local store would have had to reimplement every one of them.

`decider: ApprovalDecider` (`Callable[[Any], Awaitable[bool]]`) supplies the interactive click; when omitted, interactive mode denies by default (so buttons are only rendered when a decider exists — otherwise the user would get dead controls). Every permission decision emits an `sel().log_api_access` event (`caller="turn_driver"`, `operation="tool_permission"`, `source="messaging"`, `outcome` one of `auto_approved` / `approved` / `denied`).

**Deny-on-silence can be SPOKEN.** `open_approval(..., on_timeout=…)` takes an optional coroutine that `PendingApproval.wait` awaits when the window closes, before it returns `DENY`, so the channel can resolve the prompt still sitting on the user's screen: `approval.TIMEOUT_NOTICE` is the text. Without it the refusal is invisible: the turn moves on and a live-looking prompt remains, which a later `1` can no longer answer (it finds no open entry and gets `RECEIPT_EXPIRED`). It is a callback rather than a transport because this module never learns what a channel is, and only the renderer that posted the prompt knows which message to edit. It must not raise: the verdict is already `DENY`, and `_announce_timeout` logs and swallows anything but cancellation, because a notice that could not be posted must never become an approval. WhatsApp is the first channel wired onto it.

**The dashboard composer answers the same prompts for a web chat slot.** `useToolApproval` (`website/src/components/chat-input/approval.ts`) owns the decision its approval bar submits: a trust verb goes to the slot-scoped `api.approveChatSlot` only when the composer has a slot; from an unattended source (`UNATTENDED_APPROVAL_SOURCES`: cron, heartbeat, taskrunner), whose Trust controls are withheld, it is deliberately downgraded to a one-shot `approve` on `api.resolveApproval`; every other decision goes to `api.resolveApproval` through the shared fail-closed `toApiDecision` mapping (`website/src/utils/approvalDecision.ts`), which sends any verb that endpoint cannot honor as `reject`. `website/src/components/ChatInput.tsx` renders the bar, and `SpawnApprovalCard.tsx` beside the hook renders the slot's pending sub-agent spawns. `ChatInput.approval.test.tsx` and `ChatInput.trustOneShot.test.tsx` pin the routing.

### Channel-neutral spawn-approval delivery (`spawn_approval_delivery.py`)

The ladder above governs a MID-RUN tool prompt, which every channel's `TurnDriver`
already renders through its own `decider`. The HOST **spawn** gate is different: the
single host-wide `SubagentManager` owns ONE `on_spawn_approval` callback, built in
`slack/gateway.py`, and that callback historically raced only a Slack owner DM and
an attached dashboard client. A spawn parented on a Telegram (or any other channel)
conversation therefore reached no surface at all, and post-#8914 the gate refuses it
fast (`no_approval_surface`) rather than parking to the reaper's deadline. The
driver's per-turn `decider` cannot help here — it is wired to the main-agent tool
ladder, not to this host callback.

`spawn_approval_delivery.py` is the seam that lets the host gate reach the
originating channel's own inline keyboard, mirroring how `session_trust` lets a
channel write an auto-approve grant the driver reads without `messaging` importing
any channel package. It is a process-global registry of async delivery hooks keyed
by channel namespace:

- `register_channel_delivery(channel, hook)` / `unregister_channel_delivery(channel)`
  — a channel dispatcher opts in on startup and drops out on shutdown. `channel` is
  the channel namespace (`"telegram"`), the same token `messaging.link.channel_namespace_of`
  returns for that channel's session keys. Idempotent: a restart replaces the
  channel's own prior hook, so a stale registration can never shadow the live
  dispatcher.
- `deliver_spawn_approval(request_id, description, parent_session_key)` — what the
  host callback calls FIRST. It resolves the hook whose channel owns
  `parent_session_key` (via `channel_namespace_of`) and returns the hook's
  `True`/`False` decision verbatim, or `None` to fall through. `None` means the key
  is unowned (the CLI spawns with no parent), sits in a non-channel namespace
  (`dashboard:`, `cron:`, `subagent:`), the channel registered no hook, or the hook
  itself could not surface the prompt for this session. A hook that RAISES is
  contained and read as `None`: a channel-delivery bug must degrade to the existing
  Slack/dashboard fallback, never turn a spawn the operator could still answer into
  a hard failure.
- The operator's `channels` governance ceiling (`channel_inbound_permitted`) is
  consulted HERE, once, for every hook rather than inside each of them. Every hook
  posts an interactive prompt whose answering press arrives INBOUND on the same
  channel, and a denied channel drops that press (only an explicit reject is exempt
  on a channel's callback path), so a prompt posted under a deny is unanswerable:
  its deny-by-default wait elapses and the host gate reads the elapsed wait as a
  refusal the operator never made. A deny therefore answers `None` and the spawn
  stays answerable on Slack/dashboard. One check at this layer — which already
  resolves the channel — gates every present and future hook, where a copy inside
  each dispatcher would be the same authority duplicated per implementation. It
  runs AFTER hook resolution, so a non-channel namespace or a `unified` DM bucket,
  neither of which names a governed channel, falls through without asking the
  profile store about a channel type that does not exist.
- That pre-post check covers only HALF the window, because the gate holds a spawn
  for as long as its approval takes and a deny can land while the prompt is already
  pending. `unpressed_wait_answer(channel, request_id)` is the other half: a hook
  whose deny-by-default wait elapsed with NO press asks it what that means, and gets
  `False` while the channel is still permitted (a real deny-by-default, the
  operator declining to answer a prompt they could) or `None` once the channel is
  denied. Splitting it this way puts each half where its knowledge is: only the hook
  knows its wait elapsed unpressed, because the decision arrives as a bool and the
  cause behind it (`last_deny_cause`) is the channel decider's own; only the seam
  should read what that fact MEANS, because that reading is the ceiling's authority
  and belongs in one place for every channel. A press — approve, trust, or the
  explicit reject a denied channel's drop exempts — is the operator's own decision
  and is returned verbatim, so a reject is never converted into a fall-through that
  re-offers a spawn they just refused. A hook that answers a bare `False` without
  asking keeps the existing behaviour: the seam cannot tell such a `False` apart
  from a press, and assuming unpressed is the direction that loses a real reject.

The hook signature `async def(request_id, description, parent_session_key) -> bool | None`
is the SAME three arguments the host `SpawnApprovalCallback` receives, so a channel
posts its prompt and awaits the press without the seam reshaping anything. Keyed by
channel namespace rather than by full session key on purpose: a channel runs one
dispatcher per process, the session's channel is already recoverable from its key
prefix, and keying by the full key would force the gate to know every live session —
exactly the coupling the seam avoids. In memory only, like `session_trust`: a hook
is a live object on a running dispatcher, so a registration surviving a restart would
name a dispatcher that no longer exists; the registry dies with the process and a
channel re-registers on its next startup.

**Telegram is the reference opt-in.** `TelegramDispatcher.deliver_spawn_approval`
posts the existing Approve/Deny/Trust inline keyboard and awaits the press through
the same `on_callback` `a:` path a mid-run tool approval uses, so **Trust** grants
parent-session trust via the shared `add_trusted_session` and a later spawn from that
session is auto-approved by the parent-trusted rung. The hook is registered in
`telegram/gateway.py` on startup and unregistered on client close. The full delivery
order (channel hook → Slack-DM/dashboard fallback → the #8914 fast-fail backstop) and
the operator-log-vs-agent-error security split are documented in
[`subagent.md`](subagent.md).

**Discord is the second opt-in, and it is not identical.**
`DiscordDispatcher.deliver_spawn_approval` posts the existing Approve/Deny buttons
and awaits the press through the same `on_interaction` `a:` path, registered in
`discord/gateway.py` on startup and unregistered from the client's `on_close` hook.
Two differences from the Telegram reference are load-bearing. Discord's ladder has
**no Trust rung**, so there is no in-channel way to grant standing spawn trust here —
the operator grants it from the dashboard. And a `unified` dm_scope collapses several
peers into one session key, which names no single conversation, so such a key is
unaddressable and falls through.

**A send that fails without raising is a fall-through on both.** Each channel's
client reports a refused send by **returning no message id** rather than by raising,
so both gates read an absent id the same way as an exception: nothing was surfaced,
retire the armed nonce and fall through. Reading only the exception leaves the gate
awaiting a press on a prompt that does not exist, which spends the whole
`APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_S` window and then hands that silence to the host gate as a deny —
postponing the very surface, Slack or the dashboard, that could have answered at
once.

**The channels governance ceiling is the seam's gate, read once for every hook.**
`spawn_approval_delivery` consults `channel_inbound_permitted` after it resolves the
hook and before it invokes one, and a deny answers `None` so the host gate falls
through. It belongs there rather than inside each dispatcher: every hook posts a
prompt whose answering press arrives inbound on the same channel, a denied channel
drops that press, and a copy per implementation is the same authority duplicated
where the next hook written without it reopens the hole.

Discord adds ONE further read of its own, which is not that authority again. On the
direct route the peer's DM channel is opened INSIDE the hook; that open is a full
round trip, so the seam's answer can go stale across it and the seam cannot observe
that happening. The dispatcher therefore re-reads immediately after the open, where
everything remaining before the send is synchronous, which makes it the latest point
a read can speak for. A thread route arrives with its channel already resolved,
never suspends, and takes no re-read.

**An unpressed wait asks whether a press was still possible.** Both reads above speak
for the post; the wait after it lasts minutes. `on_interaction` drops every press once
the peer leaves `allowed_user_ids` or the thread leaves the thread roster, and every
press but an explicit reject once the channels ceiling closes, so a wait that elapses
after any of those withdrawals could not have been answered. When the decider's wait
elapsed (`last_deny_cause` is the timeout cause), the hook therefore re-reads the
same destination pair that gated the post and falls through on a refusal, then asks
the seam's `unpressed_wait_answer` for the ceiling — exactly the Telegram hook's
shape. A press, reject included, is returned verbatim, and an elapsed wait on a
destination that stayed authorized is still a deny.

For a Discord thread, "authorized destination" is the complete interaction
precondition rather than thread-roster membership alone: at least one
`allowed_user_ids` member must remain, the thread must remain allow-listed, and
`DiscordClient.is_thread_channel` must still confirm its type. The same
`_interaction_actionable` decision gates real presses and the spawn timeout's
`_spawn_approval_actionable` check; the latter also re-reads transport egress.
Thus removing every allowed user, removing the thread, changing its Discord
channel type, or revoking egress makes an unpressed timeout fall through, while
an Approve or Reject that landed before withdrawal remains the user's decision.

**A press that lands before its waiter exists is answered, not dropped.** Both Discord
prompt paths arm the per-prompt nonce when the prompt is BUILT, and the post that
follows suspends, so a press can land before the caller starts awaiting.
`register_nonce` therefore reserves the decision future as it arms the nonce, and
`resolve_global` finds it there — rather than seeing no future and failing closed,
which would deny-by-default at the timeout and tell a user who pressed Approve that
the approval had expired. A spawn-approval prompt that never reaches the channel
calls `retire`, which drops that reservation with the nonce, because the seam falls
through to another surface and runs no wait of its own on that key.

**A prompt whose wait outlives its own turn is armed detached.** `discard_session`
closes the windows a turn opened and nobody awaited, and finds them by session-key
prefix. A spawn approval matches that prefix but does not belong to the turn: the
gate awaits it in its own task and the agent is told to end its turn, so the sweep
would close a window while the user is still looking at the prompt, answer their
press with an expiry it had not reached, and hand the gate a refusal nobody
pressed. Each channel's arming call therefore takes a `detached=True` flag
(`DiscordApprovalDecider.register_nonce`, `TelegramApprovalDecider.arm`) which marks
the key so the sweep skips it, and the window closes at the decision, at the wait's
timeout, or at a `retire` and nowhere else. The flag is set where the window is
ARMED, not where the wait starts: the span between them is the post, and it is
exactly the span the originating turn can end inside. Every exit that closes the
window clears the mark too, so a gate that falls through to another surface cannot
leave its key permanently exempt. The mark is per key, so a tool approval awaited
inside its own turn is swept exactly as before.

**The task preview is cleared in the form Discord RENDERS, not the form it arrives
in.** The preview is the agent-authored `spawn_run(<task>)` string and it is the one
thing telling an operator which spawn they are approving, so it is shown rather than
dropped. The upstream credential pass scans literal text, and a secret split by
zero-width format characters survives that scan while rendering as nothing — the
reader sees it whole. `deliver_spawn_approval` therefore runs the display-form pass
over both outbound redactors, the same pass embed alt text and renderer-borne text go
through. It is synchronous, so it adds no suspension point between the destination
check and the send. Two markdown concerns ride along, because Discord renders the
message as markdown: whitespace is collapsed so a multi-line preview stays one block,
and backticks are dropped so the preview cannot close the fence it sits in and style
the rest of the message.

## Layer 2b — `Renderer` + `OutputEvent` (`renderer.py`)

### `OutputEvent`

Channel-neutral output event with a `kind` plus per-kind payload fields (`text`, `tool_call_id`, `title`, `tool_kind`, `tool_name`, `tool_purpose`, `options`, `request_id`, `context_usage_pct`, `stop_reason`, `notice`); `to_dict()` serializes them. `title` is DISPLAY copy — what a person should read for the call (the backend's own description when it sent one, else the client-derived `List files in src` / `Git status` from `kiro_crew.tool_call_title`, else the raw command) — and is never a tool's identity; `tool_name` is the trusted programmatic identity from `_meta.kiro` (empty when the backend sent none) and is what any behaviour keyed on *which tool ran* reads. `Renderer.dispatch` exposes the current call's identity as `current_tool_name` before `on_tool_call` fires, and the Slack wait-stream rollover keys on it through `slack/format.is_wait_identity` (`wait`, `kirocrew-core___wait`, `mcp__kirocrew-core__wait`; not `wait_for_ci`) with the title equality kept only as the fallback for a transport that sends no identity. `notice` rides `DONE` alone: it is the driver's **empty-turn verdict** (see "The empty-turn verdict" under Layer 2), the sentence a renderer posts where its bare placeholder would otherwise go when the turn closed with no assistant text, and `""` for a turn that produced text or was cancelled. `Renderer.dispatch` exposes it as `empty_turn_notice` before `on_done` fires, the same way it exposes `current_tool_name`. Kinds: `TEXT_CHUNK`, `THINKING`, `TOOL_CALL`, `PROMPT_CHOICE`, `COMPACTION`, `DONE` — the full set is `OUTPUT_KINDS` (a `frozenset`). `prompt_choice` is a **first-class** event, not generic "permission text": each renderer maps it to its native interactive widget.

### `Renderer` ABC

Constructed with a `TransportCapabilities`. `dispatch(event)` routes each kind to the matching `on_*` handler and raises `ValueError` on an unknown kind. Handlers:

- `on_turn_start()` — default no-op, called once before the stream begins.
- `on_text_chunk(text)`, `on_thinking(text)` — abstract.
- `on_tool_call(tool_call_id, title, tool_kind="", tool_purpose="")` — abstract; mirrors native uniform tool-call semantics (each call marks the previous task complete and starts a new in-progress task). `title` is display copy (see `OutputEvent`); a renderer that needs the tool's identity reads `self.current_tool_name`, never the title.
- `on_prompt_choice(options, request_id, tool_title="", tool_purpose="")` — abstract; renders the interactive approval/choice prompt. The two tool fields ride the `PROMPT_CHOICE` event itself and are REDACTED like every other model-authored string. Both are defaulted, so an implementation that ignores them still satisfies the contract, but a renderer should PREFER them: the alternative is a name remembered from an earlier `TOOL_CALL`, which belongs to whichever call came last, so a permission request not immediately preceded by its own titled call names a different tool. Purpose is paired to title by `tool_call_id` rather than by recency, because the permission payload carries no purpose of its own and pairing by arrival order is what puts tool A's name beside tool B's purpose.
- `on_compaction(context_usage_pct)`, `on_done(stop_reason="")` — abstract.
- `on_steer_consumed(summary="")` — default no-op; Discord/Telegram seal the pre-steer segment and open the continuation with a native acknowledgement chip using the parsed summary, without receiving raw protocol text. Webex records the fold and notes it on the final answer instead, because a separate message per fold would bury the answer and it has no spare edit to spend on one.

### `SilentRenderer` — enforcing a dashboard channel disconnect

A `Renderer` whose handlers are all no-ops, substituted for the real renderer when
the conversation has been **disconnected** in the dashboard (see the pause markers
in [session](session.md)). Disconnect means "stop talking to me there": the turn
STILL RUNS and the inbound message still lands in the session, because the binding
is retained and the dashboard is where that user is now working — only the writes
back to the muted conversation are dropped, including the typing indicator.

`dispatch.delivery_is_muted(sessions, session_key, channel_type)` is the single
predicate; `conversation_is_muted(sessions, turn)` delegates to it for the shared
pipeline. It resolves origin-vs-mirror from the turn itself (a channel-born
session's key IS its conversation, so a turn arriving in that namespace is the
origin; anything else came over a mirror/resume binding) and fails OPEN, matching
the dashboard-side predicates — a muted conversation that stays noisy is a visible
bug, a live conversation silently dead is worse.

**Every inbound pipeline must consult it.** `drive_turn` does, but Discord and
Telegram run their OWN copies of the turn loop, so each substitutes independently;
a new channel that skips this ships a dashboard control with nothing behind it.
Two contracts matter for the substitute: its `close` accepts `*args/**kwargs`
because a channel may WIDEN that signature (Telegram passes `failure_reason`), and
it must be the object that is **closed**, not merely the one streamed to — a
concrete renderer's `close` posts an error placeholder when a turn produced no
output, which a muted turn always did. It is also deliberately NOT published into a
dispatcher's `_active_renderers`, which silences the mid-turn steer chip and keeps
channel-local APIs (`note_steer`) off the shared class. Slack never reaches these
pipelines — it drives its own gateway and is gated by `slack_mirror_is_paused`.

### `chunk_text(text, max_chars) -> list[str]`

Pure helper Renderers use to honor `capabilities.max_message_chars`. Returns `[]` for empty input; a non-positive `max_chars` disables chunking (single chunk); otherwise splits into `max_chars`-sized pieces. Together with the `max_buttons` cap this is how a renderer *degrades* an over-cap message or choice set for a lower-capability channel.

## Fence-safe splitting (`split.py`)

`split_markdown_safe(text, limit, *, reserve=0, redactor=None) -> list[str]` is the shared markdown splitter every channel converges on. `chunk_text` above is blind fixed-width and the remaining per-channel splitters (Telegram's `_split_text`/`_split_markdown`, `slack/format.py::split_message`, the Webex and Weixin helpers) each carry their own fence handling, so a fix landed in one never reached the others. The module takes no config object and carries no modes; its one first-party dependency is `messaging.display_safety`, for the credential scan `redactor` drives. `redactor` is a caller-supplied callable and the only thing that makes the cut credential-aware — omit it and the split is decided by the length budget alone, which is the right answer for a caller whose chunks land inside ONE message and the wrong one for a caller that delivers each chunk as its own message (see **Credential-aware cutting** below).

Its contract:

- **Budget.** Every chunk is at most `limit - reserve` characters; `reserve` holds back capacity for a suffix the caller appends to each chunk. Empty text → `[]`. Text that already fits, a non-positive `limit`, and a `reserve` that consumes the whole budget → `[text]`. Lengths are Python `str` characters, not bytes or UTF-16 units. One documented exception: a logical line that admits no cut clean on both sides is placed **whole** rather than cut into a fabricated fence delimiter, whenever the **line itself** is no longer than `limit` — such a chunk holds that one line and nothing else. Eligibility measures the line alone, so the chunk adds its fence scaffolding (the reopener line, and the newline plus synthetic closer) on top and may pass `limit` by exactly that scaffolding; a chunk with no scaffolding to carry stays within `limit`. A bounded oversize is the accepted price of never fabricating a delimiter. Which placement a line takes is decided from the line and `limit` alone, before any budget arithmetic (remaining room, the reserved closer, what the chunk already holds) gets a say, so a cut without a clean boundary is reachable only for a line longer than `limit` — eligibility written as a guard along one arithmetic path is what made the ladder bypassable at budgets a fence's scaffolding consumes whole.
- **Real fence grammar.** An opener is ≤3 spaces of indent plus a run of ≥3 backticks or tildes (a backtick fence's info string may not contain a backtick); a closer is a run of the SAME character at least as long with nothing else on the line. Fence content is **opaque**, so a ``` line inside a ````diff block is content — the backtick-parity counters in the per-channel splitters get exactly this wrong and invert their open/closed state for the rest of the message.
- **Language-tag carry.** A cut inside a fence seals the chunk with a synthetic closer (same char, matching length) and reopens the next chunk with the original opener line, info string and indent included. The closer's cost is budgeted while inside a fence, so sealing can never push a chunk over — except after a whole-line placement, which deliberately does not reserve it (see Budget above).
- **Prefix stability (the streaming contract).** Splitting is greedy left-to-right and every cut depends only on the text BEFORE it, so re-splitting a longer prefix of the same stream reproduces every chunk except the last one byte-for-byte. A streaming caller sends sealed chunks as they appear and keeps only the final chunk as a live buffer. This outranks cut-quality heuristics: a nicer cut point that has to peek at the line after the cut is not allowed.
- **Cut preference.** Outside a fence: paragraph break if one sits at least halfway into the budget, else the last line break if it sits at least a quarter in, else a hard cut filling the budget (Discord's `limit//2` / `limit//4` ladder). Inside a fence: line boundaries only, hard-cutting a line only when it cannot fit a chunk at all. A hard cut splits one line across a chunk boundary, so **both** halves start a rendered line and the cut is pulled back until neither invents a fence: the prefix must leave the fence state untouched, and the remainder must not begin with indent or a fence character (judged by its first character alone — parsing a remainder that is still arriving would move an already-sealed cut). A fragment where every candidate lands inside a run admits no such cut, and the residue policy has two tiers: the line is placed **whole**, in a chunk holding it and nothing else, whenever the **line itself** is no longer than the caller's full `limit` — measured on the line alone, so the chunk carries its fence scaffolding on top of `limit` rather than cutting the line to make room (see Budget above); only a logical line longer than `limit`, undeliverable whole at any budget the caller allows, falls back to the widest prefix-clean cut, where the deferred remainder can still read as a delimiter. That last case is documented degradation in the same regime as an under-sized budget, and it now requires a single unbreakable line longer than the whole limit — not merely a no-clean-cut fragment that outgrew the current chunk, and not one whose fence scaffolding pushed the scaffolded sum over. The whole-line placement is reached by sealing the buffered chunk first, and that seal is keyed on cut cleanliness alone, never on the line's length: a seal driven by a line still arriving would move once the rest of it landed, rewriting a chunk already sent.
- **Whitespace.** Leading whitespace is never stripped (stripping it silently re-indents split code). Trailing whitespace is trimmed only when sealing outside a fence, where it cannot be content.
- **Tables.** A trailing pipe-bearing line is pushed to the next chunk when an earlier cut is nearby, which keeps a header row with its separator row; otherwise table lines are plain lines. Full table conversion stays with the per-channel renderers.
- **Termination.** Pathological input — a single unbreakable 10k-char line, a 5000-backtick run, a budget too small to hold a line's own fence scaffolding — terminates, at worst emitting over-budget chunks rather than spinning. Whole-line placement seals progress by consuming the line; the dirty-cut fallback keeps a width of at least one character. The **final** chunk of an unclosed fence is left open on purpose: callers own final presentation, and a streaming caller still holds it as a live buffer.
- **Credential-aware cutting.** With a `redactor`, the text is redacted against its rendered form first and every candidate boundary is then graded as the reader sees the pair — edge whitespace gone, markup rendered away — so a budget whose boundaries are all clean is searched for before anything in the text is given up. Ordinary content comes back exactly as written. When no budget is clean the offending span alone is given up, and when even that is not enough the splitter DECLINES to cut and answers with the text whole: fail-closed, one chunk over `limit`, which is the caller's problem and not the reader's. A caller under a hard transport cap re-bounds that answer and grades what it produced; a caller that re-cuts text the repair returned needs no redactor, because that text is a fixed point of the scan by contract. The final fallback is the only place whitespace is collapsed, and only inside the span that hides the key.

Discord is the first channel routed onto it, at two call sites, and it owns no fence grammar of its own: `discord/renderer.py::_rotate_on_length` consumes the streaming contract directly (seal every chunk but the last, retain the last as the live buffer, nothing appended to it and so nothing to strip back off), and `discord/session_resume.py::_replay_preview` takes the FIRST chunk as a bounded preview of a replayed transcript message, which is sealed and therefore closes any block the shortening opened. Both async call sites await `asyncio.to_thread(split_markdown_safe, …)`: the splitter terminates on pathological delimiter input, but its CPU work must not pause Discord heartbeats or unrelated turns on the event-loop thread. The remaining channels route on in follow-up changes; `test/test_messaging_split.py` pins each contract item above and `test/test_discord.py::TestRotationSplitting` pins the integration.

**A caller owes the bounded-overlimit case an answer.** The whole-line placement above can hand back a chunk over `limit` by its fence scaffolding, so a channel whose transport truncates silently must bound it again against the platform's own cap. Discord does: `_limit()` holds 100 characters back below the 2000-char cap, which absorbs ordinary scaffolding, and `renderer._fit_platform_cap` slices anything still over the cap at the single seal chokepoint. Blind fixed-width slicing is the right last resort there — it keeps every authored character at the price of a boundary Markdown may render badly, where `client.send_message`'s own truncation would drop the tail including the synthetic closer and give the user no signal. Session replay has a different tradeoff because it is only a preview: `_replay_preview` passes at most twice the delivery limit of redacted text to the prefix-stable splitter, uses the full redacted length to retain the truncation marker, and emits that marker alone when one pathological fence cannot fit with its closer. The canonical transcript remains untouched.

`iter_fence_spans(text) -> Iterator[tuple[int, int]]` is the same machine viewed over a whole message instead of one chunk's line fragments: it yields the character spans that lie inside a fenced block, opener line through closer line, with an unclosed fence running to the end. Both it and `split_markdown_safe` drive the module's single `_advance` state machine, so the open/close rule — which run length closes which fence character — exists once. A consumer that needs "is this offset inside code?" uses it rather than re-deriving the rule; the fence regexes stay private.

## Outbound file extraction (`outbound_files.py`)

An agent that produces an image writes it into the reply as markdown — `![chart](/tmp/chart.png)`. The dashboard renders that inline; a chat channel delivers the raw text, so the user reads a filesystem path where the picture should be. `extract_local_refs(text, *, limits=None) -> ExtractResult` pulls those references out for a transport to upload, and is the channel-neutral half of that: it decides which local references are safe to send, rewrites the text without them, and reports every refusal. The upload itself stays per-channel — each transport has its own multipart shape, per-file ceiling and count limit. `extract_local_refs_off_loop` is the async form; extraction reads files, so an async caller uses it rather than blocking the gateway's single loop.

`ExtractResult` carries `rewritten_text`, `files: list[OutboundFile]`, and `rejections: list[Rejection]`. An `OutboundFile` is `(path, data, alt, mime)` with `size_bytes` derived from `data`. A `Rejection` is `(dest, reason, detail)`, where `reason` is one of the module's `REASON_*` codes and `str()` renders the default prose. `ExtractLimits` sets the per-message budgets: `max_files` (references considered), `max_total_bytes` (aggregate, and the memory bound), and an optional `max_file_bytes` for a channel whose per-file ceiling sits below the aggregate.

Its contract:

- **Reference-bearing text reaches extraction before any splitter.** A caller may seal an ordinary prefix that ends before the earliest local reference, but it MUST hold the reference and its suffix intact for extraction; handing `![alt](path)` to a length splitter first can strand half a link in each chunk, unrecognisable to any later pass and visible as broken markdown. Extraction also shrinks the text that still needs final platform splitting.
- **Transports upload `OutboundFile.data` and MUST NOT re-open `path`.** Every gate below is applied to one inode, and a path resolved a second time at upload can name a different file by then — anything able to write that directory in between (another turn, a subagent, a cron) would substitute what gets sent. `path` is provenance: what a log line or a rejection names, and the raw material the sent filename is derived FROM.
- **The sent filename is derived, never the raw basename.** `upload_filename(file, index)` answers "what name is safe in a `Content-Disposition` header": the path came out of LLM-authored reply text, so only a sanitized basename survives, the extension follows the **sniffed** mime rather than the written suffix, and the RESULT is re-scanned so a name still shaped like a credential or a beacon URL is replaced outright. The extension half is the reachable one — extraction admits a file on its byte signature alone and never reconciles that with the suffix, so a raw basename can label a part with a type the bytes contradict, and the platform echoes that name back to everyone in the conversation. Discord, Telegram and Webex share `messaging/outbound_files.upload_filename`; Slack predates it and keeps an equivalent of its own in `slack/files.py`. That is duplication, not a gap — the two agree on every mime extraction can actually produce, since `_MIME_EXT` and `raster._MAGIC` have the same keys — and the shared one is where a channel added later goes.
- **A reference inside balanced inline code or a code fence is literal.** Inline spans reuse the length-preserving balanced-backtick masker used by rendered-block parsing; fenced offsets come from `iter_fence_spans` above, so neither grammar is re-derived here.
- **Only a real raster is sent.** Type comes from the leading bytes via `messaging/raster.py`, never an extension: a shell script named `.png` is refused, and SVG is scriptable markup with no signature. The same table decides inbound sniffing, so the two directions cannot disagree about a file.
- **The security floor is applied per reference**, because reply text is not trustworthy input — a prompt-injected agent chooses what it writes. Async channel extraction requires the acquired provider's actual `cwd` as its approved root; a path lexically outside that root is refused before metadata probes, and `safe_read_file_bytes_nolink(..., within_root=cwd)` rechecks the opened descriptor so a parent-symlink race cannot escape it. The existing `is_sensitive_path` denylist still applies; symlinks, hardlinks, and non-regular files are refused.
- **Every refusal is returned, never swallowed**, and the refused reference keeps its original markup so the path stays visible in the message. A file dropped in silence leaves a reply that talks about a picture with no picture and no explanation — the defect this module exists to prevent. This holds for a per-file-cap refusal too, so a channel with a low ceiling never has to drop an already-stripped file after the fact.
- **Caps bound work, not just output.** `max_files` counts references *examined*, so a reply full of unreadable paths cannot drive unbounded filesystem work or an unbounded rejection list. `max_total_bytes` is handed to the read itself, so an oversize file is refused rather than allocated, and `max_file_bytes` narrows that same read when a channel's ceiling is lower.

`test/test_outbound_files.py` pins each contract item above. Discord is the first channel routed onto it (below) and Microsoft Teams the second (see "Teams' file halves"); the remaining channels follow, and until one does its `files_outbound` stays `False` and it keeps printing paths. An adopter may be NARROWER than this module — Teams accepts only the raster subtypes it can render inline — but the one contract item it may not restate is the refusal: a reference this module accepted and the channel then cannot send must still be reported, and the path must still be visible.

`iter_local_refs(text) -> list[LocalRef]` is the scan both consumers share — every complete reference decidable from the text alone (inline-code and fenced ones, malformed markup and remote/`data:` destinations already excluded). Which destinations those are is `is_remote_destination(dest)`, shared with `image_artifacts` so the two directions cannot disagree about one string: `//host/share/...` is BOTH a protocol-relative URL and, on Windows, the only spelling of a UNC path a markdown destination can carry, which is what a roaming profile's data home produces for its own stored attachments. It is treated as local exactly where `hooks.unc_probe_allowed` — the lexical allowlist the filesystem gate in `local_destination` already applies — admits it, and stays remote everywhere else, POSIX included. `open_ref_start(text)` reports where markup OPENS and never closes, and `protected_ref_spans(text)` is the union of the two: the single answer to "where is image markup", used by the rotation guard and by `hide_local_refs(text) -> str`, the text-only cut a streaming channel uses to keep markup off live frames. An unterminated opener owns the rest of the text, because a buffer chunked while the reply is still arriving legitimately ends mid-markup — protecting only complete references is what lets a cut bisect `![alt](` and lose the attachment. `hide_local_refs` is deliberately more permissive than `extract_local_refs`: a reference it hides but extraction then rejects reappears in the sealed message, which is the safe direction; the reverse would flash a path and vanish.

### Discord's upload half (`discord/`)

The first channel wired onto the module, and the shape the others follow:

- **Named ceilings fed in as budgets, on a multipart path that shares the JSON ladder.** `client.py` declares `DISCORD_MAX_FILE_BYTES` (10 MiB), `DISCORD_MAX_FILES_PER_MESSAGE` (10) and `DISCORD_MAX_TOTAL_UPLOAD_BYTES` (25 MiB — Discord's own total is below files × per-file, so the aggregate is what bounds the bytes one seal holds); the renderer turns them into `ExtractLimits`, so an oversize file is refused *by the read* and keeps its markup instead of being uploaded and 413'd, or dropped after its reference was already cut out. `_api_multipart` sits beside `_api` and both run through one `_api_request`, so the 429 back-off, the non-JSON-body degradation and the transport-error logging exist once. The body is rebuilt per attempt because an aiohttp form is consumed as it is written — replaying one sends an empty body. `payload_json` leads, then one `files[N]` part each, with an `attachments` descriptor list built where the parts are so a descriptor's `id` always names its own part.
- **Only semantic seals extract, once.** Before any length rotation, the earliest complete or still-arriving local reference and its suffix stay in the live tail; the preceding ordinary text may seal through the shared splitter — graded as a SEQUENCE in its delivered form first, because that text is sealed whole and returns before the length path's own grade, and the splitter's own reading is of the raw pieces where a horizontal rule still stands between two credential fragments the seal will show flush — but length-sealed chunks never run extraction. The semantic steer/final seal therefore sees the reference atomically in its original whole-text fence context and uploads each file exactly once. The shared splitter documents one context-degrading tier, reachable only for a logical line longer than the full limit; if that tier is entered before a later image appears, the segment remains upload-ineligible and its markup stays literal. Both the protected-span scan on rotation and `hide_local_refs` on live frames run off-loop; neither can starve the gateway on adversarial markup. An image-only reply ships as an attachment with no raw path.
- **A failed upload restores display-redacted markup.** Discord takes every file in one multipart call, so failure is all-or-nothing. Before fallback splitting or JSON sends, the original segment runs through display-form redaction; ordinary safe image markup is restored verbatim, while markup that concealed a credential may intentionally lose formatting to keep the rendered secret redacted. Recovery splits against Discord's real `DISCORD_MAX_TEXT` ceiling with the shared splitter, then applies the hard-cap fallback for its documented scaffolding exception, so authored tails are never silently truncated.
- **Descriptions, filenames, and transformed body text are separate sinks.** Extraction unescapes alt text, so descriptions are re-scanned with the exfiltration and credential pair across both literal and canonical display forms before truncation. Filenames keep only a sanitized basename and normalize the extension to the sniffed type. Removing image markup can also reassemble a credential through Markdown that Discord hides; the transformed body therefore scans both its invisible-character-normalized literal form and canonical display form with both redactors before selective mention neutralization. The literal pass keeps a retained/rejected image destination visible to the scanner even when link canonicalization would remove it.
- **Two gates, both leaving the text untouched when they refuse, and every refusal is audited.** `files_outbound` is read before extracting, so a channel without an upload path keeps printing the path rather than silently dropping the picture. The second is the restricted-session ceiling: an approved guild thread is readable by every member who can view it, so a session the user expected to leave no trace must not ship bytes into one. A LIVE dashboard slot answers off the same `slot.is_restricted` signal that denies artifact registration; when the tab has been ARCHIVED the slot and its restricted key are both gone while the mirror binding persists, so the gate resolves the transcript's own `memory_mode` off-loop through `_probe_persisted_session` — which REFUSES to answer when one stem matches several transcripts, since taking the first candidate would let a legacy persistent file answer for an incognito session — and denies on restricted, ambiguous OR unreadable. A key that is not `dashboard:` never had a slot, so the slot rungs cannot answer for it — the CHANNEL's own privacy mode does, on the same `is_restricted` predicate its transcript, memory and title writes use, so one conversation cannot be private for three of them and public for the fourth. A flat allow there was correct only while no channel-native conversation had a privacy mode; it became a hole the moment Telegram gained `/temporary`. Still not a blanket fail-closed: an unrestricted conversation is allowed, which is the common case, and a channel offering no modes reads exactly as before. Restricted-session denials use `discord_dispatch.upload_files`; extraction refusals use `discord_renderer.upload_files` with only their closed reason codes and counts, never the LLM-authored destination.

## Per-target table rendering (`tables.py`)

A GFM pipe table is unreadable on a channel that renders Markdown but not tables: the pipes arrive literally and every column wraps, so on a phone a three-column table becomes a wall of ragged text. `render_tables(text, *, policy, native_tables=False, final=True)` converts it into something the channel can render. Stdlib-only and pure, like `split.py`.

**It is an OUTBOUND presentation transform, not a rewrite of the turn.** The canonical assistant text — what `TurnDriver.run` returns, and therefore what the transcript, history and the dashboard show — never passes through it. A renderer applies it to the bytes it is about to hand its platform client, so the same turn keeps pipes on the dashboard and gets cards on Discord. Each channel's `text()`/`_segment_text()` accessor stays canonical for the same reason: those also feed history.

**Policy is per delivery TARGET, never per session.** `TransportCapabilities.table_mode` carries the target's declaration and `Renderer.render_tables_for_target()` resolves it against `TransportCapabilities.native_tables`, so a session mirrored to two channels can send pipes to one and cards to the other.

| Policy | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `off` | No conversion. The floor, so a channel that never opts in is byte-unchanged |
| `cards` | One card per row: first column as a bold heading, later headers as labels |
| `grid` | An aligned monospace grid inside a fenced code block |
| `native` | The target renders tables itself, so pass through — **but only when it really does** |
| `auto` | Per table: a grid while its DISPLAY width fits `GRID_MAX_DISPLAY_COLUMNS` (42), cards once it does not |

`resolve_table_policy(policy, native_tables=…)` is the capability check, and it exists for one case: **`native` on a target declaring `native_tables=False` resolves to `cards`, never to raw pipes.** `auto` on a native target resolves to `off` (the platform's own table beats anything rendered here); explicit `cards`/`grid` are operator intent and are honoured on any target; an unknown policy normalizes to `auto` rather than `off`, because the unsafe fallback is the one that ships pipes.

Per-channel declarations:

| Channel | `native_tables` | `table_mode` | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Discord, Teams, Webex | `False` | `auto` | Markdown but no table rendering; delivery can split safe cards across messages |
| WeCom | `False` | `off` | One replacement bubble has no continuation path, so no adaptive form can guarantee both display safety and complete delivery under its hard cap |
| Telegram | `True` | `native` | `sendRichMessage` renders a real table, and `_seal_table_fallback` monospaces the run when that path is unavailable |
| Weixin | `True` | `native` | iLink renders Markdown natively, which `weixin/renderer.py` deliberately preserves |
| Slack | `False` | `off` | Renders no table, but `slack/format.py::_convert_tables` already flattens on the render path and the golden-transcript harness pins those bytes |

Contract details:

- **Display width, not `len`.** `display_width` counts East Asian `W`/`F` as two columns and combining marks and zero-width characters as none. Padding by `len` produces a grid whose columns visibly step, and thresholding by `len` sends a CJK table twice the viewport width down the grid path.
- **Conservative.** Anything not unambiguously a GFM table is left byte-for-byte alone: prose, a pipe-bearing sentence, a line indented by 4+ display columns with spaces or tab expansion (that is code), a malformed table whose separator row's cell count does not match its header's, a Markdown block starter in any table position (including a dash-list item that otherwise resembles a separator), anything inside a real fenced code block, and every CommonMark raw HTML block. HTML block contents are opaque until their specified closing marker or blank-line boundary, so table-shaped source inside `<pre>`, comments, declarations, block tags, and complete custom tags is never rewritten. Fences are line-anchored per CommonMark (backtick or tilde, indent ≤3, closer run ≥ opener's, a backtick fence's info string may not contain a backtick) and their content is opaque, so a ``` inside a ````diff block is content. A fence opened after a bullet or ordered-list marker carries its container indentation through the closing delimiter, so table-shaped code in the list item remains opaque and a table after the item can still convert.
- **Post-transform safety.** When conversion changes outbound text, `Renderer.render_tables_for_target()` re-runs credential and exfiltration redaction against the display form before delivery. Cards join headers and values that `TurnDriver` scanned on separate table lines; the second pass prevents a generated `Authorization: Bearer …` label/value line, or formatting removed by the platform, from assembling a secret after the channel-neutral pass. Delivery-framing fallbacks pass an explicit `cards` policy back through this same helper; Discord, Teams and Webex never call the pure formatter directly after deciding an adaptive grid crosses their cap. `off`/supported-`native` output that did not change remains byte-identical.
- **Protocol remains canonical.** Discord keeps authored source in its protocol buffer and table-rendered text in a separate delivery snapshot. Steering rotation and trailing `[OPTIONS: …]` extraction read only canonical source; steering directives are single-line and cannot span table rows. Both final and pre-steer seals consume canonical options before rendering, and presentation output is used only for streaming, size checks, and delivery—marker-shaped card content is never reinterpreted as controls.
- **Cell boundaries.** During rendering, a pipe is content, not a boundary, when it is `\|` (decided by walking the row, so `\\|` stays a boundary) or inside an inline code span. The code-span rule is deliberately LOOSER than GFM, which would split there and leave the backticks unpaired: the decision here is only a rendering, and the alternative is silently deleting a pipe the author wrote. Shape validation remains strict GFM and counts every unescaped header pipe, including one inside a code span, so malformed header/separator widths stay byte-identical. Conversion also requires that strict GFM width to equal the lossless rendering parser's header width; an ambiguous header stays byte-identical rather than shifting or truncating body cells. An unpaired backtick opens nothing.
- **Cards preserve empty data.** The first body cell becomes a bold heading only when that cell has a value. A blank repeated-category cell stays blank while the row's remaining labeled values render; the column header is never substituted as invented row data. Empty non-heading cells are omitted rather than emitted as bare labels.
- **`[OPTIONS:` / `[STEERING` lines terminate a run.** Both carry pipes and are emitted directly under an answer, so a table one line above would otherwise swallow the trailer as a body row and render the user's choices as a card.
- **Whitespace and containers are preserved.** Whitespace outside a converted run remains exact, including blank-line runs and a trailing newline. A run's leading container indentation (up to three display columns) is carried onto every nonblank rendered line, so conversion does not pull a nested table out of its indented list context.
- **Grid fences cannot collide with cell content.** The generated backtick fence is longer than every backtick run in the aligned header and body, so a literal ``` cell remains content rather than closing the grid.
- **Idempotent.** Neither rendering contains a table run (cards carry no pipes; a grid lives inside a fence, which is never entered), so a streaming renderer may convert its buffer eagerly and re-convert what it retains.
- **Streaming (`final=False`).** A table run reaching the end of the text may still be growing, so it is left raw; the same deferral applies when the immediately following final line is unterminated, because `Row ` can become the outer-pipe-less body row `Row 1 | ok` in the next chunk. Converting either state would freeze a half-arrived row as a card and strand the rows behind it. A run terminated by settled real content converts either way. Discord treats the difference between the streaming and final render as a pending-table signal: once the header and separator are recognizable it buffers that segment and neither rotates nor updates the live frame until prose terminates the run or the turn finishes. A separator split across provider chunks may therefore leave one earlier partial-pipe frame visible briefly, but the completed send edits that same message to the rendered table; no recognized table is split into raw rows.
- **Degenerate cases.** A header-only run renders as a grid regardless of policy (there is no row to make a card from, and dropping it would lose the run's only content). The same lossless fallback applies when a nonempty body's sparse rows produce no card lines: the grid preserves both headers and empty cells instead of replacing the table with nothing.

Discord converts INTO its buffer rather than at the send seam, because `_rotate_on_length` sizes messages from that buffer and cards are longer than the pipes they replace; converting on the way out could seal a message past the platform's hard 2000-char cap. A still-growing trailing table remains buffered even when it grows beyond one message, then the completed output is split normally — no rotation may strand headerless raw rows. When a generated grid itself exceeds one Discord segment, Discord first re-renders it as cards: the shared splitter reopens a cut fence with its original opener, so a split grid stays valid Markdown but its header row reaches only the first message, while cards stay readable on their own. Teams and Webex likewise re-render a narrow grid as independently readable cards before their normal character/byte chunking when it would cross one platform message. If forced cards retain an over-cap grid, those split-capable targets preserve display-safe raw table text through ordinary continuation chunking instead; generated-grid metadata prevents this fallback from downgrading valid cards. WeCom keeps canonical table text because its streamed answer has no continuation-bubble path: a transformed form can exceed the hard cap while the only shorter raw candidate still contains a value that display-form redaction would remove.

`test/test_messaging_tables.py` pins the pure contract; `test/test_channel_table_rendering.py` pins which target converts, that the driver's canonical text does not, and the `native`-without-the-capability coercion.
## Turn-status surfacing (`status_reactions.py`)

Two things tell a chat user how their turn is going without adding a message to
the conversation: a reaction on their own message that swaps as the agent moves
through the turn, and one low-emphasis line at the end carrying how long the turn
took and how full the context window now is. Both live in this one module because
both are the same shape, per-channel decoration over channel-neutral state, and a
channel that keeps its own copy of either drifts from the rest.

**The phase ladder.** `PHASES` is the ordered vocabulary everything here is keyed
on: `queued`, `thinking`, `coding`, `browsing`, `tool`, `done`, `error`.
`PhaseReactionLadder.set_phase(phase)` walks it, and exactly ONE reaction
represents the turn at a time: entering a phase removes the previous emoji and
adds the new one. Three tiers decide when a transition reaches the channel.

- `TERMINAL_PHASES` (`done`, `error`) land at once and end the ladder. `finalize`
  is idempotent and clears any stall mark BEFORE the terminal emoji, since a
  leftover mark beside it reads as still-stuck.
- `IMMEDIATE_PHASES` (`queued`) also land at once: that one is the receipt for
  "your message arrived", and delaying it defeats the point of it.
- Everything else is **debounced** by `LadderTimings.debounce`
  (`DEFAULT_DEBOUNCE_SECS`, 0.7s), re-armed on each transition, so a turn that
  fires five tools in a second costs one visible swap instead of five. Every
  channel rate-limits reactions, which is what the debounce protects: a tool burst
  must not spend that budget on emoji nobody reads.

A stall watchdog adds a SECOND, additive mark once nothing has happened for
`stall_soft` (15s) and upgrades it at `stall_hard` (45s, the hard mark replacing
the soft one rather than joining it), so a wedged turn is visible without the user
asking. `on_progress()` resets it on any activity, and
`pause_stall_watchdog()` / `resume_stall_watchdog()` bracket a legitimate wait on
a human, which is why a turn parked on an interactive tool approval never earns
the "gone quiet" mark. A `StallEmojis` field left `None` suppresses that mark and
its timer, so a channel with no stall vocabulary schedules no watchdog at all. All
four durations sit on the injectable `LadderTimings`, so a test needs no real
clock.

Classification is `tool_to_phase(name, kind)`. A declared ACP tool kind wins over
the name, because a bring-your-own tool can be named anything while still
declaring a known kind, and an MCP tool's fully qualified name
(`mcp__example-mcp__Bash`) reduces to its base name after `__`; anything
unrecognized is the generic `tool` phase. `phase_for_tool_title` is the same
answer for a DISPLAY title: kiro-cli titles a command tool `Running: <cmd>`, so a
channel handing the title straight over would classify every command as a generic
tool.

**The emoji sink is injected, never imported.** The single channel operation the
ladder needs is "add or remove ONE emoji on ONE message", and it arrives as a
`ReactionSink` bound to one message (`CallableReactionSink` wraps two coroutine
functions, so a channel binds its client, channel and message into closures at the
call site rather than writing a sink class). That is what keeps the pinned one-way
dependency direction intact: `kiro_crew.messaging` imports nothing from
`kiro_crew.slack` / `kiro_crew.discord` / `kiro_crew.dashboard`, and a ladder that
reached for a channel's REST client would reintroduce exactly the cycle this
package exists to remove. The ladder therefore never handles a channel id, a
message id, or an emoji vocabulary. Either sink call may fail, and a failure is
logged at debug and dropped: a reaction is decoration, so a deleted message, a
revoked scope, or a rate limit the channel refused to queue must not surface as a
failed turn.

**The phase-to-emoji table is per channel, for the same reason.** Emoji are the
channel's vocabulary: Slack's reaction API takes a shortcode (`eyes`), Discord's
route takes the unicode character itself. So the table is injected alongside the
sink, and `merge_phase_emojis(defaults, overrides)` applies a user's overrides onto
whichever table the channel owns, RETURNING the unknown keys rather than honouring
them so the caller can report a typo instead of dropping it in silence. A `None`
value suppresses that phase (no emoji is added, though a transition into it still
clears what the previous phase left behind), and a phase with no entry falls back
to its own name so a channel that adds a phase still shows something.

**`close()` drains, and that is the whole point of it.** Both halves of the ladder
outlive any single `await`: the debounce and stall timers are `loop.call_later`
handles, and every sink call runs as a task the ladder holds a reference to so the
loop cannot collect one mid-flight. `close()` cancels the timers FIRST so nothing
new is scheduled, then gives the calls already in flight one bounded window
(`close_drain`, 5s) to land before cancelling them and gathering the results: they
are the turn's last emoji and worth waiting for, but a channel API that never
answers must not hold teardown open. Skipping either half is the defect this
prevents. An armed timer fires against a turn that has already finished,
re-decorating a message nobody is waiting on; an untracked task outlives it, so
a renderer torn down by an exception leaks work into whatever runs next. `_spawn`
closes rather than starts a coroutine once the ladder is closed, for the same
reason.

**The turn-end line** is the module's other half and carries no ladder state.
`format_turn_status(elapsed, context_pct)` renders `Finished in 3m 7s` plus a
context-usage chip banded by how close the window is to needing a compaction
(green below 30%, yellow from 30%, orange from 50%, red from 70%), and omits it
entirely when the
caller could not read a usage figure: absent means unknown, which is not 0% and
must not render as a reassuring green.

Discord is the first channel on the shared ladder: `discord/renderer.py` owns
`DISCORD_PHASE_EMOJIS` (unicode rather than shortcodes, one code point each,
because the reaction route carries the emoji as a percent-encoded path segment),
`DISCORD_STALL_EMOJIS`, and a
`_MessageReactionSink` bound to the user's message whose PUT/DELETE both route
through the client's request ladder so they share its rate-limit accounting. The
ladder is armed lazily and only when there is something to decorate: reactions
enabled for the channel, a transport that declares `reactions`, a recorded user
message id, and a renderer that has not been closed, since a late event after
teardown must not arm a fresh ladder whose timers would then outlive the turn.
Slack still runs its own `StatusReactionController` (`slack/handler_runtime/reactions.py`,
re-exported by `slack/handler.py`), the
implementation this module was generalized from, so until Slack moves over the
same phase machine exists twice. `test/test_status_reactions.py` pins both: the
shared ladder's phases, debounce, stall marks, close-drain and sink-failure
tolerance, and Slack's controller beside them.

## Durable inbound spool (`inbound_spool.py`)

Gateway shutdown runs channel teardown and `SessionManager.close_all()` concurrently, so a message the platform has already accepted can be refused by the `_closing` gate before its turn opens. Before this module the payload was discarded at that `except SessionClosingError` and the user got the channel's generic fault (or, on Slack, nothing). Issue #2217.

**What it does, and what it deliberately does not.** It records the refused message durably and, on the next start, tells the user in that same conversation that it was never processed, quoting it back so a resend is one tap. It does NOT re-drive the message as a turn. A re-dispatch half was built and removed: replaying an entry as the operator's own turn makes the spool a second INTAKE path into the model, and every authorization the live path applies at intake (peer allow-list, Telegram's forum gate, Discord's thread roster, WhatsApp's group gate, conversation rotation) has to be re-established on it per channel and kept in step forever. A notice is a proactive SEND, and a proactive send already has exactly one authorization seam, `MessagingTransport.may_send_to`. Scoping the replay to the notice puts the whole feature behind a gate that already exists and is already owned. Re-dispatch, if wanted, is a separate design owned by the channel dispatch wiring (#9144).

**Written only at the refusal point, never on the happy path.** That scoping is what settles the design questions rather than answering them: there is no ack protocol to design because nothing is written on success; a turn that completed just before exit was never written, so nobody is told to resend something that was answered; the happy path costs zero writes; and platform redelivery is not needed because the pass reads our own disk (nine of ten channels ack before the turn runs anyway).

**Adoption is opt-in per channel** via `ChannelTurn.inbound_route: InboundRoute`. Every adopted pre-turn dispatcher claims callback admission before card/command interception and reuses that refusal route. WhatsApp's native event callback and Weixin's per-message long-poll segment additionally register their upstream receive task in the live client `_handler_tasks` set before transport authorization, media, context-token, or governance awaits; the gateway census and final restart drain traverse those sets. Handler-task channels use `admit_inbound_callback`, keeping an open callback counted until its owning task finishes. Inline-loop channels use `hold_inbound_callback`, keeping only the current dispatch counted rather than pinning the long-lived poll task busy forever. In either shape, a callback arriving after update admission closes is spooled before any pre-turn side effect. The route is declared at the channel's dispatch site, where it still holds its normalized envelope, because `ChannelTurn.conversation_id` is a session ATTRIBUTION id (`"weixin:{user}"`), not a reply target. `InboundRoute.text` is the message the USER sent, never `ChannelTurn.user_text` — WhatsApp's rules mode prepends the group's private operating rules to the model prompt, and the restart notice quotes the entry verbatim. A channel that transforms its prompt MUST set it, and there is no fallback to the turn's prompt (an earlier fallback is how a media-only rules-mode message came to spool the group's rules). Weixin captures `text` and the attachment count BEFORE ingestion, because ingestion rewrites the text with turn-owned temp paths and clears `inbound.attachments`; WhatsApp does the same in `receive` via the `pending_original` side table (keyed like `pending_verdicts`), and its dispatcher declares NO route when the entry is absent rather than falling back to the ingested `inbound.text`. **A route is declared only where `may_send_to` can express revocation for it**: Discord's answers from `_allowed_threads`; WhatsApp's answers from `dm_policy` alone and knows nothing of the group roster, so WhatsApp spools DMs only and a refused group message degrades exactly as before this seam.

**The store.** One JSONL file, `<data_home>/inbound-spool/refused.jsonl`. A COUNT cap (`SPOOL_MAX_ENTRIES`, newest wins) and an AGE horizon (`SPOOL_MAX_AGE_SECS`) in one primitive — nothing else in the tree combined the two; both are applied on write and again on read. Per-entry text cap with visible truncation. Dedupe on the platform `message_id` ONLY: a body digest would collapse two identical messages on a channel with no id, which is data loss (repeating yourself is ordinary), so an identity-less entry is appended, never matched. The refusal write runs off-loop in `asyncio.to_thread` (it takes a file lock and does disk I/O, and a replay worker may hold the lock) and is wrapped in `asyncio.shield`: the handler that reached the refusal is a task `close_all` is about to cancel, and a bare `await` there would be a cancellation point that orphans the write. With the shield the caller is cancelled and the write is not. Shielded writers stay in a process registry counted by the updater census and drained before re-exec. After that drain the updater commits a yield-free restart fence: later refused callbacks write the same bounded record synchronously, so no new asynchronous writer can open between the final snapshot and `exec`. Slack Socket Mode reserves at the envelope boundary before ACK; a paused envelope is left unacknowledged for Slack to retry on the replacement gateway. An executor already shut down (`RuntimeError`) falls back to the same inline write. The whole read-modify-write is serialized by `platform_compat.file_lock` on a dedicated lock file (the spool itself is replaced by rename, so a lock on the old inode would not exclude a writer that opened the new one). **Not for a restricted session**: Slack uses `_is_slack_restricted(session_key)`. Telegram, Discord, and Teams pass a lazy restriction resolver to `admit_inbound_callback`: it runs only after reservation refusal, resolves the channel's full resume decision, and checks the native, resumed, expected, observed, and adopted session keys with the same predicate that gates durable-history writes. The upstream client handler task remains in `_handler_tasks` throughout those routing awaits, so restart cannot overtake the decision. Teams also carries the final answer as `ChannelTurn.inbound_restricted`, covering a shutdown-gate refusal after callback admission succeeded. An incognito or temporary conversation therefore skips both spool sites and persists nothing; the message degrades to the pre-feature loss. A read failure raises `SpoolUnreadable` rather than reading as empty, because every writer rewrites from what it read and the reader unlinks an empty file. Never raises to the caller: a write failure at shutdown degrades to the pre-feature loss; a read failure at boot leaves the file for the next start.

**The notice pass is AT-LEAST-ONCE, one entry at a time.** `replay_spooled` runs as a detached boot task after the transports are up (`GatewayOrchestrator._replay_spooled_inbound`; `_shutdown` cancels it with a one-second budget). For each entry, oldest first: `peek_next` returns it WITHOUT removing it; the `channels` governance ceiling is asked through `vet_and_audit("channels", channel_type, tool_name="inbound_spool.notice", fail_closed=True)`, the same audited seam every other proactive-send site uses, and a denied channel is HELD (not dropped: the route is not revoked, the channel is governed off, and the horizon bounds it); `may_send_to(conversation_id, thread_id, principal=)` is re-decided (a spooled entry is not a standing grant; a transport with no gate, or one that raises, is read as revoked). **The principal is normally passed for a DM route only.** Slack is the sole sender-owned threaded route: it has no separate thread roster, so its pass-local replay adapter resolves the channel's home workspace, receives the stored owner id, rechecks the current owner roster, and still posts in the original Slack thread. Discord threads and Telegram Topics remain authorized by their thread route alone: Discord's `may_send_to` falls from a thread not in `_allowed_threads` to `principal in _allowed` on the assumption that a thread route names no principal, and a spooled thread entry does name one (the sender), so passing it there would let a still-allowed sender authorize a notice into a thread revoked while the gateway was down; a revoked route is DROPPED and removed with no notice; otherwise `send_message` posts `RESTART_NOTICE` quoting the entry (through `display_safe_for`, so a quoted broadcast mention cannot fire; sized to `capabilities.max_message_chars` with a VISIBLE truncation mark, because the prefix can push a message that fit on the way in over the cap and a transport that slices and still returns an id would otherwise confirm a silently cut notice) and names any dropped attachments; `remove_entry` runs only AFTER the send is confirmed. Confirmation is `messaging.transport.delivery_confirmed` (the shared predicate: a non-empty message id, or any return at all on a transport whose `capabilities.returns_message_id` is `False`, i.e. WeCom and Feishu, which return `""` on success and raise on failure). An UNCONFIRMED send (a raise, an empty id) leaves the entry on disk for the next start and the loop moves on, so one dead route cannot park the queue. **Once per entry per pass**: an entry the pass attempted and left on disk (unconfirmed, or noticed but `remove_entry` returned `False`) is never handed back to that pass, so an unwritable spool costs one notice per entry rather than `SPOOL_MAX_ENTRIES` per entry; an entry that was removed is not remembered, so an identical id-less twin sharing its `trace_id` is still noticed in the same pass. An entry whose channel is not connected THIS run is never touched (a startup blip is not the operator disabling the channel); the age horizon still bounds it. This direction is safe precisely because the only action is a notice: a crash between the send and the removal costs one repeated line, never a repeated side effect, which is the opposite of the tradeoff a re-dispatch would have to make. Removal is by ONE occurrence of the entry's `trace_id` and is always the atomic replace (never a bare unlink, which fails routinely on Windows under an AV handle and would re-notice the entry on every start).

**Adopted:** Slack, Teams, Webex, WeCom, iMessage, Feishu, Telegram, Discord (with the thread), Weixin, and WhatsApp DMs. WhatsApp group routes remain outside this notice design; attachment re-download is tracked in #8911, and re-dispatch plus WhatsApp group routes in #9144.

**The spool is a trust boundary** — see `security.md`.

## Layer 3 — session-key namespacing (`link.py`)

Session keys are namespaced as `f"{channel_type}:{conversation_id}"` (`session_key()`) so keys never collide across channels (`SLACK_NAMESPACE = "slack"`). Legacy native-Slack sessions were keyed by the bare `thread_ts`; helpers provide the bidirectional `bare ⇄ slack:` shim consumed by `SessionMap` (`session_map.py` imports `ChannelLink` + `canonical_key`, no import cycle):

- `is_legacy_slack_key(key)` — True iff `key` is a bare Slack `thread_ts` (matched by `_SLACK_TS_RE = r"\d+\.\d+"`, digits + one dot).
- `canonical_key(key)` — normalizes a bare legacy key to `slack:<thread>`; non-legacy keys (`dashboard:`, `channel:`, `slack:`, …) pass through unchanged. `SessionMap._load` (called from `__init__`) migrates bare keys and populates a Layer-3 `ChannelLink`; `get()`/`set()` re-canonicalize so a not-yet-updated caller passing a bare `thread_ts` still resolves.
- `legacy_key(key)` — returns the bare `thread_ts` for a `slack:<thread>` key, else `None`.

A Slack key's scope segment is not always a thread timestamp: with `slack.dm_single_session` on, a 1:1 DM is keyed `slack:<channel_id>` (`slack.transport_dispatch.flat_dm_session_key`) so the whole DM is one session. That is still the two-segment legacy shape — `is_legacy_slack_key` does not match a channel id, so `canonical_key` passes it through unchanged and `legacy_key` returns `None` for it, which is correct: there is no bare form to fold. It is deliberately NOT a `build_dm_session_key` bucket; see session.md for why the four-segment shape does not fit Slack.

`ChannelLink(channel_type, channel_id=None, thread_id=None)` records the inbound channel a session belongs to (its **own** channel), with `to_dict()`/`from_dict()`. It is deliberately distinct from the dashboard→Slack *mirror* binding, which stays behind `SessionMap.get/set_slack_link` and is **not** modeled here (guardrail G3).

The dashboard's `website/src/utils/channelOrigin.ts` mirrors the channel-session
namespaces for origin labels. Both live `:` keys and persisted `_` keys identify
`imessage` as **iMessage** and `feishu` as **Feishu**. These product names remain
untranslated, including in `channelBrandLabel` lookups by channel type. Matching
is case-sensitive and requires the namespace separator: user-titled keys such as
`iMessage_thread_triage`, `Feishu_thread_triage`, and longer namespace lookalikes
receive no channel-origin label. `website/src/utils/channelOrigin.test.ts` pins
both key forms, exact brand spellings, and these negative cases.

## Config flag & routing

`MessagingConfig.use_transport` (`config/loader.py`, default `True` in Kiro Crew; exposed in `config.json` under `messaging`) is the single switch. `slack/events.py::_route_message` checks `orch._cfg.messaging.use_transport`; when `True` it creates a task on `handle_message_transport` and skips the native `handle_message` monolith. (There is no challenge-redirect in this fork — Slack messages are processed inline.) Approval mode is resolved by `_resolve_approval_mode(orch)` (respects configured mode + operator YOLO/SafetyOverride TTL), and the per-channel `slack.channels.<id>.agent` override is passed through.

## Live configuration

Every channel setting that CAN take effect in a running gateway does, from any
writer — the dashboard save, `kirocrew config set`, or an `$EDITOR` edit of
`config.json`. One shape covers all eleven channels, and the shape is the same
whether the value is an authorization roster, a per-turn threshold, or a socket
parameter.

**One watcher.** `src/kiro_crew/config/live.py` owns the single process-wide
`ConfigWatch`: one background task, one fingerprint check per tick off the loop,
one `KiroCrewConfig.load()` when it moves, one diff flattened to dotted leaf
paths, and one sequential dispatch to subscribers on the loop. No channel polls
`config.json` itself. Each dispatcher registers in its `__init__` —
`live.watch_section(self, "<channel>", "messaging", target="transport",
name="<Channel>Dispatcher")` — and keeps the returned `Subscription` on `self`,
because the watcher holds the owner WEAKLY so a dispatcher a test builds and
drops does not pin itself into the registry. That one line carries the prefix
gate, the not-yet-connected-transport no-op and the degraded-section refusal, so
no dispatcher hand-writes them. Teams, Telegram and Discord pass no `target`:
each keeps a roster of its OWN — the surfaces that bypass `transport.receive`
(a Teams session list, a Telegram callback, a Discord interaction) re-check
against it — so the dispatcher owns `reconfigure(section)`, updates its copies
IN PLACE so a holder handed the same object follows, and then pushes at the
transport. Discord additionally UNIONS the reloaded thread list with the ids this
process promoted at runtime, tracking the last configured set so a thread an
operator removes is still dropped.

**Allow-lists are PUSHED, wholesale, and fail closed.** Each transport exposes
`reconfigure(section)`: it rebuilds every authorization set with the SAME coercion
its constructor applies (Telegram's user ids to strings and forum chat ids to
ints, Discord's snowflake strings, Webex's lowercased emails, WeCom's
`{userid, name}` flattening, Weixin's `_coerce_opaque_str_ids`, WhatsApp's
`normalize_jid` and `_coerce_whatsapp_groups`, iMessage's `normalize_handle`,
Teams' lowercased emails) and REPLACES the frozenset in one assignment, so an
`authorize` running concurrently reads one consistent roster rather than a
half-updated one. Discord's `_allowed_threads` is the one set that is UNIONED
rather than replaced: a thread this process created at runtime is not in
`config.json`, and dropping it would strand every follow-up the user sends into
it, while a thread an operator REMOVES from the config is still dropped, so the
reload narrows as intended. A field whose reloaded shape does not parse keeps the PREVIOUS
value and logs at WARNING, and a `slack`/channel section the loader DISCARDED
(`cfg.degraded_sections`) applies nothing under it: rebuilding a roster from a
value the loader could not read would either lock out every intended sender or
admit a room nobody approved. The skip is raised as `ConfigDeferred` so the
watcher retries those paths once the file validates — a repair back to the
defaults the degraded snapshot already held diffs empty, and the roster would
otherwise never catch up (config spec, "deferred, never dropped"). An empty list is a real value on the channels whose
gate denies on empty (iMessage, Webex), because empty there means deny-all rather
than unreadable. Every roster change is SEL-audited by COUNT — added, removed,
resulting size — never by id, since the per-message admission decision is already
audited where it is made. The audit runs AFTER the roster is adopted, never
before: `sel()` validates its trust root on first use and can raise, and an audit
that ran first would leave a revoked id authorized until SEL recovered, with every
watcher retry re-hitting the same failure. A `reconfigure` that adopts several
sets adopts them all before auditing any (Feishu's `_reload_id_set` returns the
set plus its delta for that reason), so a raise in the first audit cannot strand
the second roster on its old value; the error still reaches the watcher, whose
retry then finds nothing left to adopt. A transport that is not attached yet (`transport` is
`None`, as in a dispatcher a test builds bare) makes the applier a no-op.

**Per-turn values are read at the point of use.** Thresholds, `dm_scope`,
`queue_mode`, `idle_reset_minutes`, `daily_reset_hour` and the render toggles are
not pushed into anything: each dispatcher's `_live_cfg()` is
`live.current(self.cfg, log_prefix=...)`, which returns `live.snapshot()` when
the watcher is armed, else a fingerprint-cached `KiroCrewConfig.load()` (two
stats on a hit), else the boot copy. Falling back to the boot copy rather than
raising keeps a turn running when `config.json` is momentarily unreadable — a
threshold is not an authorization decision, and the boot value is the one the
operator last had in force. Thresholds re-run the loader's own
`_normalize_threshold_pair`, so a reloaded soft value above the hard one cannot
make the soft nudge unreachable. `dm_scope` is the exception among the messaging
fields: it is `restart=True` and every dispatcher reads it from its boot copy.
It chooses the session-key namespace, and each conversation's generation counter
is seeded (`seed_fn`) from the namespace in force at boot — adopting a new value
live, even at a generation boundary, would mint keys in the other namespace with
a counter seeded for this one, and could resume a stale session persisted there.
A restart re-seeds every counter from the new namespace, which is the only safe
boundary.

**Connection fields restart ONE channel, in process.** A socket, a bot token or a
bridge path cannot be swapped under a live connection, so the gateway reconnects
just that channel instead of asking the operator to restart the process. Each
bootable `ChannelDescriptor` declares its `boot_keys` (`messaging/registry.py`);
when a reload names one of them, `GatewayOrchestrator.restart_channel` closes the
old handle, re-runs that channel's hoist against the new config and a fresh
credential read, re-checks the `channels` governance gate and the readiness
badge, and starts the transport again. The two halves run differently. The
CLOSE is inline in the watcher's dispatch and bounded (2s per channel): a save
that awaited `refresh_now` answers with inbound access already shut, the mirror
registration gone and the legacy `_<channel>_client` cleared, so no queued
inbound traffic reaches a transport whose config was just revoked. Only the
RECONNECT runs as a tracked background task, because the applier is awaited
under `ConfigWatch._cycle`'s lock, which every dashboard save also waits on, and
a connect that hangs for its timeout must not stall every other applier and
every save response. A reconnect always rebuilds from the watcher's current
snapshot, never from the change that scheduled it. The connect itself runs
outside `_channel_restart_lock` (the close before it and the publish after it
hold the lock), so a newer close is never queued behind a slow connect; a
per-channel restart generation (bumped by every close) makes a start that was
still connecting when a newer close landed discard its client instead of
storing a transport built from a superseded document. Shutdown cancels any reconnect still in flight
before closing the handles. Slack is not in that loop — its socket is
host-managed. See [slack-gateway](slack-gateway.md) § Live configuration.

**`restart_required` is answered from schema metadata.** A channel save's
response no longer guesses: `dashboard/channel_folders.py::channel_restart_required`
asks `kiro_crew.config.schema.requires_restart(path)`, which reads the `restart`
flag on that field's `_meta(...)` in `config/sections.py`. A field nothing marks
is live, so the settings page tells the truth instead of promising a restart the
user does not need — which is how a panel trains people to restart for
everything. A `.env` write always reports `True`, because the credential file is
not watched.

**The exceptions**, and they are the whole list:

- **`slack.command`** — the slash command is registered with Slack's app
  manifest, so changing it here cannot re-register it. Marked `restart=True`.
- **`whatsapp.db_path`** — the linked-device session store is opened once by the
  `neonize` client. Marked `restart=True`.
- **Credentials in `config_dir/.env`** — bot tokens, app passwords and secrets
  are not in `config.json` and the watcher does not read that file, so a
  credential save reports a restart even for a channel whose config fields are
  all live. A channel whose token also lives in a legacy `config.json` fallback
  restarts through `boot_keys` when that copy changes.

## Proactive sends (`send_message`'s `channel_type`)

Everything above carries a REPLY: an inbound message arrives, a turn runs, its
output goes back where it came from. A proactive send has no inbound message to
answer — a silent cron finishing, a background task reporting — so it has to name
its destination, and for most of this module's life the only names it had were
Slack's. An agent driven from Telegram could not notify its own operator at all,
and a silent cron on such a session reported nowhere: not to Slack (no thread), not
to the dashboard chat (no slot), only to the bell nobody on Telegram sees.

`send_message`'s `channel_type` closes that. It is one of **two mutually
exclusive destination families**, and a call carrying both is refused rather than
resolved by precedence — either order silently drops a destination the caller
named, and the caller cannot tell which one it lost:

| Family | Fields | Reaches |
|---|---|---|
| Slack | `session="slack"`, `channel`, `user`, `thread_ts`, `reply_broadcast` | the Slack client's own path |
| every other channel | `channel_type` | the conversation the calling session already belongs to |
| every other channel | `session="<channel>"` | that channel's own configured owner, wherever the call came from |

The two non-Slack rows answer different questions and neither substitutes for the
other. `channel_type` rides the calling session's `ChannelLink` and **fails closed
when there is none**, so it serves a session that is already talking on the
channel; a cron whose origin is the dashboard, or which has no origin at all, has
no link for it to ride. `session="<channel>"` needs no link — it resolves the
destination from the transport's own `configured_targets()` through
`_deliver_channel_dm` — which is what makes it the route for a proactive notice
raised somewhere other than the channel itself.

**One roster, three views.** The channels a proactive send may name are derived
ONCE, as `constants.CHANNEL_SEND_NAMESPACES` — `CHANNEL_SESSION_NAMESPACES` minus
`slack` (its own client, spelled `session="slack"`) and `unified` (a session-key
bucket, not a transport). The MCP tool's advertised enum
(`mcp_tools.messaging._CHANNEL_SESSIONS`), the pre-handler validator's pattern
(`validation._SEND_MESSAGE_SESSION_RE`) and the gateway's accepted `channel_type`
set (`_SEND_MESSAGE_CHANNEL_TYPES`) all read that one constant, because each is a
gate the value passes in turn and a narrower one in front silently withholds a
destination the wider ones behind it would serve. That is not hypothetical: the
first two were hand-kept and stood at `discord` alone for months after eight more
transports were registered, so `session="webex"` was refused as malformed by a
validator while the gateway leg behind it could already resolve and deliver a
Webex owner DM (#6514). The subtraction itself was then respelled at each of the
three readers, which is the same shape one level up, so it is derived at the
definition and the readers name it rather than recompute it.

The roster lives in `constants` (`os` + `re` only) rather than `messaging.link`
because it has readers on both sides of an import cycle: `messaging.link` is
itself stdlib-only, but importing a name FROM it executes `messaging/__init__.py`,
which pulls in `driver` → `acp` → `hooks`, and `hooks` → `webhooks` →
`validation` is already an edge. `messaging.link` re-exports both names, so its
own readers are unchanged. One sibling hand-kept copy remains and is NOT derived:
`autonudge._CHANNEL_KEY_PREFIXES` (defined in `autonudge_service/model.py`), which answers
a key-SHAPE question rather than
a send-capability one. Its membership is currently identical to the roster's, so
the older claim that it is deliberately narrower does not hold; deriving it is
sound and deliberately out of scope here.

**A channel `session` needs an owner; `channel_type` does not, so the rosters
differ by one.** `channel_type` names a conversation -- the calling session's, or an
explicit `target_id` -- and infers no recipient. A channel `session` infers one via
`_owner_dm_target`, whose safety claim is that the agent can only reach somebody the
USER configured. The inference itself is `messaging.transport.sole_direct_target`
(exactly one available `user:` target among `configured_targets()`, else nobody),
and it is the ONE spelling of "the owner of a channel": session control's
owner-DM audience predicate (`session_control.owner_dm_refusal`, see
[session-control](session-control.md)) consults the same function, so the human a
proactive owner DM reaches and the human whose 1:1 DM may act as a conductor are
the same by construction, and a channel that stops naming an owner loses both at
once. `constants.CHANNEL_OWNER_DM_NAMESPACES` is therefore
`CHANNEL_SEND_NAMESPACES` minus the channels that cannot answer that question, and
today that is `weixin` and `wecom`. Each folds identities LEARNED from inbound
traffic into `configured_targets()` — Weixin's `_known_users` (`_allowed |
_known_users`), WeCom's `_warm_chats`, which under `allow_all_users` become the list
outright ("there is no configured list to draw on, so the warm peers ARE the list").
So a peer who messaged the bot once can be the single available direct target, which
is exactly what `_owner_dm_target` reads as the owner. Nothing downstream catches
it: both `may_send_to` implementations return True unconditionally under their open
policy (Weixin's promise to consult `_allowed` alone holds only on its `allowlist`
branch), and `resolve_configured_target` accepts the learned set too.
`channel_type` is unaffected for both and stays available.

The exclusion is not hand-kept:
`test_no_owner_dm_channel_advertises_learned_identities` derives the check from the
transports, so a channel that starts mixing learned identities into
`configured_targets()` fails that gate instead of silently becoming an owner-DM
target. A channel graduates by separating configured recipients from learned peers,
at which point deleting it from the subtraction is the whole change.

**Widening the roster does not widen the audience.** Whether a channel can take a
proactive DM is answered per send by `_owner_dm_target`, at the side-effect
boundary against live config, which is where a runtime question has to be answered
— a static roster cannot. A transport needing prior inbound state (Teams, WeCom)
or unable to DM proactively at all (Feishu) marks its targets unavailable; an
allow-list with several people is refused rather than guessed at. Both degrade to
the dashboard notification, and the tool says which channel missed rather than
reporting success.

**Both channel legs require a strictly-resolved caller.** `channel_type` and a
channel `session` each resolve identity through `mcp_core.require_strict_session_key`
and refuse when it is absent. The refusal is the control, not a formality:
`gov_session` otherwise falls back to the lenient resolver, which walks process
ancestors, so an unidentified sub-agent resolves to its PARENT — and the
channel-agent containment check (`_deny_channel_agent_messaging`, which fires only
on an identity starting `channel:`) then does not fire for a contained agent,
putting the owner-DM egress surface inside its confinement boundary. The gateway's
fail-closed `channels` re-vet does not backstop that: it covers the transport
scope, not channel-agent containment. Refusing costs no legitimate caller, because
the gateway injects `KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY` into every agent/ACP subprocess and a
cron run carries `cron:<job_id>` in it, with the HMAC-verified host-pid sidecar
covering PID-namespace-sandboxed sessions; it is absent only where there is no
session key to inject.

**And the gateway vets that identity rather than the host sentinel.**
`_deliver_channel_dm` resolves `caller_session or HOST_SESSION_KEY`, and the host
sentinel is the PERMISSIVE default, so dropping a caller's identity there lets a
session whose own profile denies the transport reach a host-permitted owner DM —
the MCP-side channel vet degrades open on an evaluation error, so it is not a
second guard. Each arm takes its identity from where that arm is trustworthy,
matching `_channel_delivery_key` on the same path: a cron's body key is
format-validated before it may escalate routing, and a non-cron caller is
identified by the `X-Session-Key` header, which `token_auth._verify_unix_peer`
kernel-attests against the peer's own process ancestry — never the body, which a
tool argument could name. The governance vet and the delivery key therefore
resolve the same principal. The `channel_type`/`target_id` leg already worked this
way; the channel-`session` leg was not migrated with it.

`"slack"` is deliberately **not** a legal `channel_type`: Slack is absent from
`state.channel_transports` on purpose, so the shared ladder skips it and accepting
the value would fail every such send closed with no useful reason.

**The delivery ladder**, which `dashboard/handlers/messaging.py::api_send_message`
drives: origin session injection (`session="origin"`, unchanged, in the route) →
`_deliver_to_channel` → Slack (both in
`messaging_api/proactive_send.py::_deliver_send_message_fallback`). `_deliver_to_channel` rides
`chat_runner._resolve_channel_target`, the same governed cross-surface seam as the
outbound mirror, the auto-compact notice and the inbound-unbind notice, so a
proactive send is capability-checked, `channels`-vetted (fail-closed) and
SEL-audited exactly like every other outbound notice rather than through a
second, differently-gated copy. Its text goes out through
`renderer.display_safe` — the shared outbound display sink, redaction against the
RENDERED form and then mention defang — so this egress cannot be sanitised
differently from the ones beside it, and it adds no new sink to
`security_posture._REDACTION_SINKS`.

Four properties are load-bearing:

- **A named channel is not a Slack fallback.** `channel_type` suppresses the
  Slack leg outright, including the cron-to-owner-DM default. A failed channel
  delivery falling through to Slack would post the message to an audience the
  caller never named, which is worse than not delivering it.
- **Failure is reported, not absorbed.** Every refusal — no link, a link on
  another transport, a governance denial, an unregistered transport, one that
  cannot send proactively, a transport error — returns `False`, is audited with
  its reason, and surfaces as HTTP 502 `channel_delivery_failed`. The bell is not
  a substitute for the surface the user is reading, so a notification-only
  outcome must not read as success. `delivered_to` gained a fourth value,
  `"channel"`, for the same reason: without it a successful Telegram send still
  reported the "reached the dashboard notification only" warning.
- **The caller does not get to name the conversation.** A cron's destination
  comes from its job's stored `session_key` (gateway-owned scheduler state);
  every other caller is identified by the `X-Session-Key` header, which
  `token_auth._verify_unix_peer` kernel-attests against the peer's own process
  ancestry. The request BODY is never consulted for this, because nothing checks
  it — a body naming another session's key would post into a conversation the
  caller does not own. Note this is a different key than
  `_resolve_session_target` returns: that one strips `dashboard:` to get a slot
  NAME, while channel links are keyed by the full session key.
- **The governance gate names the real transport.** The `channels` scope is a
  per-transport allowlist, so the MCP tool vets `channel_type`'s transport and
  not `"slack"`. Vetting the wrong one evaluates a Telegram denial against
  Slack's rule, and refuses a permitted Telegram send whenever Slack is denied.
- **Revocation is re-decided at egress, not trusted from the link.**
  `_resolve_channel_target` consults `transport.may_send_to(link.channel_id,
  link.thread_id)` after the governance gate and refuses the target when it says
  no, so **every** proactive leg inherits the check rather than each remembering
  it. The two gates answer different questions: governance asks "may this session
  use the telegram channel at all", which stays permitted, while this asks "is
  this conversation's recipient still on the roster". A denial is SEL-audited
  (`operation="channel.proactive_send_authorize"`, `outcome="denied"`) because a
  revoked recipient silently losing its notices looks exactly like an idle agent,
  and a raising implementation fails **closed**, because an allow-list check that
  errored has authorized nobody.

  One caller opts out of this leg — and only this leg — with
  `check_recipient=False`: the mirror-link creation pre-check
  (`chat_mirror.api_chat_slot_mirror_link`), whose link carries the
  configured-target SPELLING (`user:<id>`) rather than a conversation id, because
  channel-scope governance must run before `resolve_configured_target`'s possible
  network side effect. `may_send_to` judges conversation ids, so the prefixed
  spelling can never match a roster of bare ids and every allow-listed recipient
  was refused (#9414). The handler re-decides the recipient against the RESOLVED
  conversation id immediately after resolution, through `_authorize_recipient` —
  the ONE shared spelling of the recipient decision, the exact function this
  ladder leg runs — with the same 403 contract and the principal from the target
  spelling as `_deliver_channel_dm` does, so the decision moves later on that one
  path; it is never skipped and the two copies cannot drift. That call passes
  `audit_allowed=True`, so the admission is SEL-recorded on both outcomes (it
  admits a recipient once per link); the per-send ladder legs keep denial-only,
  because they run per delivered unit and an allowed record there would write an
  audit row per mirrored message. Every persisted-link caller keeps the default.

  The check gets two inputs, because one alone cannot serve every channel. The
  **conversation id** answers it wherever that id already IS the roster identity:
  **Telegram** (a private `chat_id` IS the `user_id`; a Topic routes through the
  same `forum_gate_outcome` predicate as inbound, so outbound can never reach a
  Topic inbound would refuse), **iMessage** (the handle IS the conversation,
  normalized both sides), **Weixin** (mirrors its `dm_policy`, and deliberately
  ignores the learned `_known_users` set so a peer who spoke once cannot outlive
  its removal — `WeixinTransport.reconfigure` replaces `dm_policy` and
  `allowed_user_ids` on a config reload, denying on an unknown policy value, so a
  removal takes effect on the next send) and **WeCom** (defence in depth; it declares
  `supports_proactive_send=False`, so the ladder refuses it earlier). **Teams**
  reverse-maps through `_reachable_conversation`, the same predicate
  `resolve_configured_target` and `configured_targets` answer from, so "may I send
  here" cannot drift from "where do I send". Its `ServiceUrlStore` is PERSISTED, so
  it permits while that store is still unread and enforces from the first load
  onward: `send_message` awaits its own `ensure_loaded`, and the transport is
  registered before `connect` starts the warm-up, so denying in that window would
  refuse a send the transport can complete from a route already on disk.

  The **principal** covers the rest. `chat_runner._recipient_principal` reads the
  session KEY first (`_session_principal`), recovering the peer's platform id from
  a key whose canonical grammar is `{surface}:{agent}:{chat_type}:{scope…}` with
  the scope of a 1:1 DM being exactly that peer, using
  `messaging.link.parse_session_key` because that module is the one canonical
  address parser. This is what makes **Discord** (a DM link persists a channel id
  unrelated to the user snowflake, and re-deriving it is a POST a synchronous seam
  cannot make) and **Webex** (binds a `room_id` while the roster holds emails) able
  to reach their rosters at all, so a revoked DM recipient is refused on those
  channels too. Both are the principal answer for their **DM** route only: each
  also owns a room-audience roster — Discord's `_allowed_threads`, Webex's
  `_allowed_rooms` — and answers that route from it instead, because a room route
  has no principal to name (see below).

  The key is deliberately empty rather than wrong whenever it names no single
  person: a forum/group route scopes to `(chat_id, thread_id)` so its audience is a
  room, a `unified` DM bucket drops channel and user out of the key by design, a
  legacy key does not parse, and a **dashboard-born** key (`dashboard:chat-<n>-<ts>`)
  names no channel peer at all. Empty means "the key does not name one
  principal", never "nobody is authorized".

  **The key is read alone, and that is a security property rather than a
  convenience.** Two records of a peer are NOT consulted, because a principal only
  authorizes anything if it describes the conversation the link points at. The
  session's stored channel value (`{namespace}:{user_id}`) is written ONCE at
  session creation while the origin/mirror link is rewritten on later turns, so
  under a `unified` bucket, which collapses several peers' DMs into one session on
  purpose, the two drift: the attribution can name the peer who created the session
  while the link points at a different peer's conversation. Authorizing against it
  would check the wrong person and **pass**, which is worse than declining to name
  one. A forum scope's `scope[0]` is a supergroup id, and its stored value is the
  last sender rather than the audience, for the same reason.

  **One further source IS consulted, when the key names nobody: the record the
  GATEWAY wrote when it admitted the mirror.** The link carries the peer it was
  admitted for (`ChannelLink.principal`) together with an admission
  (`ChannelLink.admission`): HMAC-SHA256 over the canonical session key and the whole
  location — channel type, conversation id, thread id, peer — under a key derived from
  `token_signing.key` with a purpose label of its own (`kiro_crew.mirror_admission`).
  The verifier judges the link it is handed and consults nothing else in the store, so
  the unbind notice for an ordinary unlink — sent after the clear, to the displaced
  link — still resolves its recipient. The stated residual: a row the gateway once
  signed for this session, location and principal can be replayed after an unlink
  (in-sandbox code that copied the signed row while the binding existed writes it
  back, and after a restart nothing contradicts it until the transport learns the DM's
  pairing); refusing it needs revocation state the agent cannot write back (#15358).
  That is the agent-writable-row class the issue tracks; sealing a store is the
  operator's sandbox decision, not this module's.
  That key is masked from every agent plane by the sandbox and already certifies the
  tag-grant store's key (`dashboard.chat_tag_grants._key_cert`), so this is the
  repository's established way to make an agent-writable record unforgeable — no new
  seal, no widening of what the sandbox masks. **Exactly two paths mint an admission**
  (pinned by AST), the two that authorize a peer for a conversation: the dashboard's
  mirror-link handler (`chat_mirror.api_chat_slot_mirror_link`), which resolves a
  `user:<id>` target into exactly this conversation, admits it through
  `_authorize_recipient` and signs the link before writing; and the resume
  controller's pick commit (`SessionResumeController.choose`, reached from a Discord
  `!sessions` press that arrives in the owner's own DM and is refused for anyone but
  the single configured owner), which signs the link for the chosen session as it
  claims the binding. `SessionMap.set_mirror_link` NEVER mints: it stores the
  caller's admission bytes verbatim, because a generic writer that signed whatever it
  was handed would launder a forged row into a trusted one the moment any path re-set
  it. Every rollback that re-sets a row it read back — the failed-flush `!unlink`
  restore, the pick commit's rollback of the chosen and displaced rows, the dashboard
  handler's release after a failed link — goes through
  `mirror_admission.restorable_link`: a peer is restored only under an admission that
  still verifies for that session and location, otherwise the binding goes back as its
  location alone, audited (`channel.mirror_admission` / `stripped_on_restore`) and
  logged once, and the send stays refused. Each of those rollbacks undoes only its OWN
  work, judged on the whole stored row (`ChannelLink.same_row`: location AND peer AND
  admission), never on the location alone: a re-link of the same session to the same
  conversation under a refreshed admission — the shape a signing-key rotation produces
  — is newer, deliberate state, and a location match would clear it and put an
  obsolete row back; the release rollback, whose own work is a CLEAR, restores a row
  only where the row it removed — the entry's own `mirror` field
  (`SessionMap.has_mirror_row`) — is still absent, never judged on `get_mirror_link`,
  which also answers for bindings the clear never touched (a Slack link synthesized
  from a surviving thread id, the legacy `dashboard:` row it falls back to) and on
  such a slot would read as "still bound" and skip the promised restore. An origin
  bind, a room or thread target, and
  an in-channel `/link` record no peer and are not signed; their recipient decision is
  unchanged. The ladder (`chat_runner._recipient_principal`) hands the roster the
  recorded peer only when the admission verifies for THIS session and THIS location
  (`hmac.compare_digest`), and only when the transport's own record of the
  conversation — `direct_peer_of` (Layer 1), for Discord the `dm_channel_id ->
  user_id` pairing its client learns when it opens a DM or an authorized message or
  press arrives in one — does not name someone else. **The session map is writable by
  in-sandbox code, which is why the record is signed rather than trusted:** a row
  rewritten to name an allow-listed user for a revoked user's DM, a row rewritten
  consistently to another allow-listed user's DM, a row copied onto another session,
  and a row that names a peer with no admission at all fail verification and are
  refused, audited (`channel.mirror_admission` / `unverified`) and logged once, with
  the remedy named — re-link the session, which mints a fresh record. The check
  REFUSES and never raises: every malformed shape a planted row can take — an
  admission that is not a string or not a 64-hex digest (the constant-time
  comparison itself raises on a non-ASCII string), a peer that is not a string,
  fields of any type — verifies `False`, because the decision sits
  on the send path of a dashboard turn and an exception there would abort the turn
  on exactly the row the check exists to reject. Both audits
  (this one and the rollback's `stripped_on_restore`) put in-tree constants in the two
  SEL fields the log stores verbatim (`caller`, `source`) and carry the row's own ids
  only in the redacted `resources` field, because those ids come from the same
  agent-writable file and a credential planted in one must not reach the append-only
  log unredacted. "Once" is kept by a set that is bounded in both dimensions: it is
  cleared when it reaches 512 entries, and each entry is a fixed-length digest of the
  marker (`chat_runner._marker_digest`), never the conversation id itself, so 512
  refusals with successively larger agent-written ids hold bounded memory. The transport's
  pairing is defense in depth over that: a disagreement refuses (`contradicted`), and a
  transport that knows nothing — the ordinary state right after a restart, before the
  peer has written into the DM — contradicts nothing, so the verified record stands
  and **the recipient leg admits the mirror across a gateway restart with no inbound
  message**; the gap closes for rows that carry an admitted peer and stays fail-closed
  for rows without one. One residual is unchanged by this and documented above
  (§ Authorization across a send's own waits): a Discord send that hits one of the
  REST ladder's own waits before the pairing is learned again is refused by the
  mid-send re-check as unattributable, because that re-check reads the pairing store
  alone; a send that never waits — the ordinary single reply — is delivered, and the
  peer's first message or press re-learns the pairing. **A token-key rotation
  invalidates every admission at once**, and such
  mirrors are refused until they are re-linked. The roster still decides per send
  whether the admitted peer is allow-listed, so revocation lands exactly as it does
  for a key-named peer. This is what serves the common shape of the mirror feature —
  a dashboard-born session mirrored to a Discord DM from the dashboard menu or from
  `!sessions` — whose key names nobody and whose DM channel id cannot be tested
  against a user roster: with only the key, the handler's own post-claim ladder
  recheck and every later dashboard-driven reply into that DM were refused and
  dropped, while the same link on Telegram delivered because there the conversation
  id IS the user id. The key outranks the record wherever it names a peer, so every
  key-named session keeps its established reading; the `channel_id` a key-named row
  stores is not covered by an admission, which is the pre-existing class tracked
  separately. `ChannelLink` equality excludes both fields: a binding's identity is its
  location, and `find_mirror_sessions`, the occupancy check, the nonce and the resume
  rollbacks all match by value.

  **A transport with more than one audience dispatches on the route rather than
  testing one id against the wrong roster.** Discord has two: a **thread** route
  (identified by `thread_id`, which `receive` sets to the thread's own snowflake,
  the same value it uses as the conversation id, and leaves unset for a DM) is
  checked against `_allowed_threads`, the set `receive` itself gates inbound on,
  so outbound is exactly as tight as inbound. That also settles the auto-created
  thread: those ids are registered in memory only, so after a restart such a thread
  cannot drive a turn either, and continuing to post into it would make outbound
  the more permissive of the two. A **DM** route is checked against `_allowed` via
  the principal.

  **Webex** has the same two, and a group space is why: a **space** route is
  recognised by its conversation id being in `_allowed_rooms` while
  `allow_group_rooms` is still on — the same pair `room_permitted` gates inbound on,
  so outbound is neither tighter nor looser. Both sets are replaced wholesale by
  `WebexTransport.reconfigure` on a config reload, so flipping the switch
  off or dropping a room revokes that space's proactive traffic on the next send —
  which is what matters, because a persisted link outlives the config that
  authorized it. This arm is load-bearing rather than a convenience: a space is keyed as a
  `forum` route on `(chat_id, thread_id)`, so `_session_principal` names nobody by
  design, and answering only via the principal would drop **every** proactive send
  into an allow-listed space while the in-channel turn path kept working — a space
  that answers an `@mention` but is silent for the dashboard mirror, cron results,
  subagent completions and compaction notices, which reads as half-alive rather than
  misconfigured. A **DM** route is checked against the email allow-list via the
  principal, because a session binds `room_id` while that roster holds emails and
  nothing in the process maps one back to the other.

  A DM route with no principal from either source is **refused** on those two
  transports: neither roster can be consulted, and an unidentifiable recipient at a
  network egress boundary must not be posted to. What reaches that refusal is a
  `unified` bucket bound from inside the channel (its key names no peer by design
  and its in-channel binding records none), a DM link written before the peer was
  recorded, a row whose admission does not verify (unsigned, rewritten, moved to
  another session, or signed under a rotated key — re-linking mints a fresh one),
  and a row the transport's own pairing contradicts. That costs an unattended
  notice on such unified-scope Discord and Webex sessions, and it is the correct
  trade rather than a regression to accept, because that bucket deliberately
  collapses several peers and nothing available to this seam establishes which one
  the link currently points at. Sessions under the default `per-channel-peer` scope
  carry their peer in the key, and a mirror made from the dashboard or from
  `!sessions` is served from the gateway-admitted record on the link, so both are
  served — across a restart, with no inbound message. Every refusal is audited, so
  this is visible rather than silent.

  **Slack** never reaches here at all, because the ladder returns early for
  `SLACK_NAMESPACE`: its proactive traffic uses the gateway's own client.
  `test_channel_transport_outbound_authz.py` requires every shipped transport to
  override the method rather than inherit the permissive ABC default, so a new
  channel cannot skip the question.

### In-place edits (`update_message`)

`update_message(channel, ts, text?, blocks?)` rewrites a message the bot itself
posted — the rolling status message, the checklist that ticks, the estimate a
result supersedes — instead of posting a follow-up that buries the original. It
is **Slack-only** (`chat.update` via `slack/client.py::update_message`, which
injects the workspace `team_id` for multi-workspace installs) and it takes the
`ts` a `send_message` response reports. Either `text` or `blocks` is required and
what the call carries REPLACES the message, so an edit sending only `blocks`
drops the old text.

It is gated as an EGRESS, with `send_message`'s ladder rather than
`delete_message`'s bare shape checks. Deleting retracts content the audience
already has; an edit PUBLISHES new agent-authored text to that same audience, so
`mcp_tools/messaging.py::update_message` requires strict identity
(`require_strict_session_key`), refuses channel agents
(`_deny_channel_agent_messaging`), and vets both `capabilities.messaging` and the
per-transport `channels` scope for `"slack"` — the transport the edit actually
leaves over. Without that pair, a session whose messaging capability is off could
still push arbitrary text into Slack by editing a message it posted while the
capability was on. Every return path lands on the SEL trail.

The route is `POST /api/update-message`
(`dashboard/messaging_api/proactive_send.py::api_update_message`, registered in
`dashboard/server.py::_register_mcp_routes` and listed in
`_STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS` — loopback plus `X-Internal-Secret`, no cookie
fall-through, exactly like `/api/send-message` and `/api/delete-message`). It
applies `api_send_message`'s outbound floor —
`redact_for_display` over the text, `_sanitize_blocks` over the blocks — because
the replacement content reaches Slack as-is. It applies the tracked-channel
allowlist to ROOM targets only: a `D` channel is never a tracked channel, so a DM
edit passes on the prefix, while a public or private channel must still be in
`slack.tracking_channels` (403 `channel_not_tracked`). That allowlist is the
operator's revocation lever, not only a first-contact check — without this rung a
message the bot authored while the channel was tracked would remain a writable
slot in it after the operator revoked egress. Same shape as the `file_send` Slack
leg (`dashboard/upload_destination.py::resolve_slack`).

### Where the dashboard messaging handlers live

`dashboard/handlers/messaging.py` is the import path and the patch surface of every
route it serves. The owners it composes live in `dashboard/messaging_api/`,
and `messaging_api.compose` runs their functions on the facade's globals, so a patch of
the facade reaches moved code. New work goes to the owner of its responsibility:

| Owner (`dashboard/messaging_api/`) | Holds |
|---|---|
| `proactive_send.py` | what `POST /api/send-message` reads and refuses (`_read_send_message`, which also delivers a configured `channel_type` + `target_id`), its fallback legs, audit row and answer; `update_message` and `delete_message` |
| `channel_delivery.py` | the channel legs: a channel owner's DM (`_deliver_channel_dm`), a configured target (`_send_to_channel_target`), the session's conversation (`_deliver_to_channel`) |
| `spawn.py`, `run_control.py`, `run_views.py` | spawn admission and continue; the run controls and their session fence; the status and list views |
| `notifications.py` | the notification feed and the per-channel notification settings |
| `*_settings.py`, one per channel | that channel's settings API |

The facade keeps the code repository guards read there by path, and the shared
pieces. That is `api_send_message` itself, which redacts and authorizes the Slack
target and injects into an origin session between the read and the delivery. It
also keeps the Slack pin, reaction, profile and manifest routes,
`api_notification_agent_push`, `api_teams_activity`, the iMessage save entry, the
channel-folder backfill, the browser routes, `_run_belongs_to_caller`,
`parent_work_supported` and the shared channel-config transaction
(`_LockedSectionWrite`, `_write_env_off_loop`).

## Telegram dashboard-session resume

A private Telegram DM can take over an existing dashboard conversation without
opening the dashboard:

- `/session <words>` (plural `/sessions` remains an alias) runs the dashboard's
  ranked title-and-content search and posts up to ten owner-scoped inline buttons.
  The command is exposed in Telegram's command menu under its singular spelling.
- A button carries only a bounded nonce and index. The shared
  `SessionResumeController` rechecks owner, picker, message, history existence and
  binding conflicts before marking the selected session's `ChannelLink` as
  `accepts_inbound=True`. Telegram declares `supports_session_resume=True` because
  every ordinary inbound message resolves that binding before choosing a native
  Telegram session key.
- The common native Telegram session may already hold an **outbound-only** mirror
  to the DM. Selection replaces that mirror transactionally so the first click is
  sufficient; a live inbound owner or a selected session active on another channel
  is never displaced. A failed claim restores the outbound mirror.
- Session-scoped commands (`/stop`, `/compact`, `/model`, `/title`, `/spawn`,
  `/task`, and privacy modifiers) use the resolved dashboard key. `/link` also
  resolves first, but refuses while a resumed session owns the conversation and
  directs the user to `/unlink`. Recovery and host-level commands stay native so
  a stale or ambiguous binding cannot block `/new`, `/unlink`, `/session`, `/help`,
  `/status`, `/ping`, `/cron`, `/yolo`, `/kirocrew dashboard`, `/voice`, or
  `/agent`.
- `/new` and `/unlink` call `SessionBinder.release`, which atomically clears the
  inbound link and retires its durable expectation. `/new` then advances the native
  Telegram generation; `/unlink` returns to the existing native conversation. A
  durability failure changes nothing and is reported instead of silently splitting
  history.
- A message queued while a native Telegram turn is busy keeps native affinity when
  it drains (`interpret_commands=False` skips resume resolution). A `/session` bind
  created after enqueue therefore cannot redirect already-queued text into the
  selected dashboard conversation. Busy resumed sessions refuse a second message
  instead of queuing it, so the exception cannot strand resumed work.
- Every `/model` picker records its exact target session and re-resolves the current
  binding on press. `/new`, `/unlink`, an agent switch, or any rebind invalidates the
  old picker before `session/set_model`; only a native picker stores the route-level
  preference used by later Telegram generations.
- Listing and selection are limited to exactly one configured operator in a private
  DM. Dashboard-created Telegram links apply the same rule through
  `may_resume_from`: with several allowed users they remain outbound-only. The
  dispatcher rechecks ownership on every inbound route and callback, so a binding
  written under an earlier single-owner configuration cannot survive a roster
  change as an authorization bypass. The gate covers the durable expectation store
  as well as the live map: a detached binding whose expectation survives resolves
  no key and no ambiguity, yet the binder still builds a notice from the dashboard
  session's TITLE, so for a non-owner ANY non-empty `RoutingDecision` becomes the
  generic refusal, which names nothing. Its settlement is deliberately left OWED
  rather than acknowledged by a message never delivered, so the real owner still
  receives the notice. Forum Topics cannot enumerate or resume
  dashboard history.
- **A restricted dashboard session resumed here writes no transcript.** The turn's
  durable write is skipped when `upload_gate.session_is_restricted` reports the
  resumed session incognito or temporary — the same predicate the upload ceiling
  reads, so one conversation cannot refuse the file and then record the text.
  `privacy_mode.is_restricted` is **not** sufficient on this path: it answers off a
  process-local tracker that only an inbound CHANNEL message populates, so for a
  `dashboard:` key it reports unrestricted and fails open. It remains the gate
  inside `_persist_turn` for Telegram's own native conversations. The decision is
  made on the loop, before either writer, because the live slot registry and the
  persisted-transcript fallback are not reachable from the worker thread. A
  restricted turn skips BOTH direct persistence and `project_channel_turn_live`:
  projection marks the dashboard slot dirty, and a later dirty-slot flush would
  otherwise persist the rows the direct writer refused. `/title` uses the same
  dashboard-aware predicate because its metadata write creates the transcript. On
  an unrestricted LIVE slot it updates `slot.title`, `_titled`, `_title_origin`
  and `_title_epoch`, persists through the dashboard's epoch-aware title writer,
  and broadcasts `slot_title`; writing only transcript metadata would let the
  slot's next save restore its old title. `/temporary` and `/incognito` are
  refused while resumed (including a modifier carrying a message, which is NOT
  processed): runtime memory-mode switching is not a dashboard capability, and
  marking only Telegram's channel tracker would promise privacy while the live
  persistent slot kept recording. The user must `/unlink` or `/new` first.
  The two ceilings deliberately differ on an UNREADABLE persisted mode
  (`unknown_denies`): an upload denies every unknown, because shipping bytes
  cannot be taken back, while history denies only an unknown whose transcript
  EXISTS — an ambiguous stem matching several transcripts, or a header no normal
  session wrote, which is exactly where an incognito session can hide. A legacy
  header missing `memory_mode` reads `persistent`, not unknown, so the sole
  unknown history allows is a truly absent record: nothing on disk claims the
  session is restricted, and denying there would stop recording every
  conversation whose transcript has not been written yet.
- **Dashboard link claims BEFORE it announces.** `POST .../mirror-link` writes the
  binding first, then sends "Session linked from dashboard" and the catch-up
  transcript. The old order announced first and claimed last, which left a window
  as long as the backfill takes — delivery is inline and one message per unit
  against the transport's rate limit, roughly a second each on Telegram — during
  which an inbound reply resolved no binding and ran in the channel's NATIVE
  session, the one the notice had just said the user left. Claiming first follows
  the endpoint's own reasoning that a binding can be unwound while posted messages
  cannot: every failure path after the claim (a governance narrowing at the send
  boundary or mid-backfill, a failed announcement) releases it, restoring the prior
  link and opt-out rather than unlinking a session that was merely being rebound.
  The claim and its release run in a worker thread, like the resume binder's, since
  `batched_save` rewrites the whole map file on exit. A `ConversationOwnershipConflict`
  now surfaces before anything is posted.
- **A temporary resumed session reads no memory either.** `temporary` blocks memory
  and lesson READS as well as writes, while `incognito` deliberately still reads —
  that is the whole difference between the modes. `upload_gate.session_blocks_reads`
  answers on the same three rungs (the channel tracker for a native key, the live
  slot's `blocks_reads`, else the persisted mode, with unknown-on-an-existing-record
  failing closed). `privacy_mode.is_temporary` cannot answer alone: it reads a
  process tracker a dashboard slot never populates, so a resumed temporary session
  would take yesterday's memories into today's prompt. The write ceiling does not
  cover this — the leak is inbound, into the model, not outbound to disk.

## Telegram forum topics (per-Topic sessions)

A Telegram **supergroup with Topics enabled** maps onto the same `thread_id`
abstraction Slack uses, so one bot serves many parallel, topic-scoped sessions
(Slack channel+threads) instead of a single session per user.

- **Routing / session key.** The transport captures each update's
  `message_thread_id` (the Topic id) and carries it as the neutral
  `InboundMessage.thread_id`. The dispatcher folds `(chat_type, chat_id,
  thread_id)` into a route and reuses the `chat_type` slot of
  `build_dm_session_key`: a Topic keys to
  `telegram:{agent}:forum:{chat_id}:{thread_id}`, while a private DM stays
  byte-for-byte `telegram:{agent}:direct:{user_id}`. `messaging.dm_scope="unified"`
  collapses **only** direct DMs into the `unified:{agent}` bucket — forum routes
  always keep the full per-Topic key, so no group Topic can share a session with
  a DM or another group.
- **Per-Topic generation.** `ConversationState` is keyed on the same route, so
  `/new`, idle/daily rotation and `/compact` are scoped to one Topic.
- **Gate — fail-closed AND Topic-scoped.** `forum_gate_outcome(chat_type,
  chat_id, message_thread_id, *, allow_forum, allowed_forum_chat_ids)` is the
  single predicate guarding **both** `TelegramTransport.receive` (frozen
  allow-list) and `TelegramDispatcher.on_callback` (live cfg). It authorizes a
  turn/callback only for a real forum Topic — `chat_type == "supergroup"` AND a
  `message_thread_id` — in an allow-listed chat (`telegram.allow_forum` **and**
  `chat_id ∈ telegram.allowed_forum_chat_ids`). Ordinary groups and the
  supergroup **General** chat (no thread) are denied and SEL-audited
  (`denied_forum_not_allowed` / `denied_non_private_chat`); the owner
  `allowed_user_ids` check still gates *who* may drive a turn.
- **Outbound.** Streamed answers, command/notice replies, queue receipts, the
  queue drain, callback re-dispatch, and the `/link` dashboard-mirror
  `ChannelLink` all carry `message_thread_id`, so every reply lands in its Topic
  and a queued message drains under the forum key (`editMessageText` is not
  threaded — the message id already identifies the message within its Topic).
- **Should it answer, above may it.** `telegram.forum_activation` (`always` |
  `mention` | `off`, anything else normalized to `always`) is the second decision,
  taken by `_activation_outcome` after `forum_gate_outcome` has authorized the turn:
  without it an allow-listed Topic cannot host a conversation between humans,
  because every message would start a turn. Scoped to non-private chats — a 1:1 DM
  is served in every mode, matching Slack's separate `slack_dm_activation`, since
  narrowing a noisy Topic must not silently mute the operator's own DM. A dropped
  message is SEL-audited (`denied_activation_off` / `denied_activation_mention_only`)
  and never reaches a turn.
- **`mention` reads Telegram's own entity classification, not the text.** Telegram
  marks a handle inside a link as a `url` / `text_link` entity and never as a
  `mention`, so `_mention_handles` (`telegram/client.py`) extracts the handles it
  called mentions and the gate tests membership. A text scan cannot tell the two
  apart: `https://host/@thebot/x` satisfies any `@handle` pattern, and
  `_flatten_text_links` appends a formatted link's TARGET into the text, so anyone
  able to post a link could otherwise hand the scan a handle to find and start a
  turn nobody asked for. Entity offsets are UTF-16 code units, which is why the span
  is sliced through a UTF-16 encode rather than by Python index — one emoji ahead of
  the mention shifts every later offset. A message carrying NO entity list at all
  (an album with no captions, a hand-built envelope) falls back to the token
  matcher, because "never parsed" is not "nobody was mentioned", and such a message
  has no auto-detected URL for the matcher to trip over either. A reply to one of
  the bot's own messages (matched on `bot_id`, not `is_bot`) also activates, since
  long-press-Reply is how a Telegram user addresses a bot without typing its handle.
  Both inputs are unresolved until `getMe` lands, and the gate answers False rather
  than True in that window so `mention` cannot behave as `always` at startup.
- **A host-wide LISTING also needs an UNAMBIGUOUS OWNER**, not just a DM. With more
  than one entry in `telegram.allowed_user_ids` the listing is refused and audited
  (`no_unambiguous_owner`), because an allow-list is a list of people permitted to
  talk to the agent and not a claim that one of them owns the install: under the
  default per-peer `dm_scope` those are separate sessions belonging to separate
  people, so listing every conversation hands one allow-listed human another's
  titles. This is the rule the owner notification already follows — "exactly one
  configured target, or nothing", which cites `/sessions`' owner-only rule as its own
  premise — reaching the surface it was named after. It costs an operator who lists
  two of their own accounts, the same cost accepted there, because the count is over
  ALL configured entries and a two-person allow-list is a guess either way. Scoped to
  the listings: a multi-person install still chats, stops, compacts and spawns.
- **A host-wide LISTING is refused outside a DM** —
  `TelegramDispatcher._require_direct_chat`, one gate for `/sessions` and `/cron`,
  refusing before the listing is built and auditing the refusal
  (`shared_topic_audience`). The allow-list gates who may DRIVE a turn, not who can
  READ the reply, and a Topic is readable by the whole supergroup: answering there
  would disclose every session on the host, or every scheduled job, to members who
  were never allow-listed at all. Slack's equivalents need no such rule (their reply
  lands in a DM or in a thread the caller is already in), which makes this the
  Telegram-specific half of one rule rather than a divergence from parity.
- **Scope follows the ARGUMENT, not the command name.** `/sessions` and `/cron` are
  listings outright; `/spawn` and `/task` are conversation-scoped with one argument
  and host-scoped with another, so they ask
  `messaging/commands.lists_host_state(command, arg)` — true for `list` and
  `status`, which
  render `manager.running` (every subagent on the box, with its task text) and the
  one global task runner, neither filtered on the session. That predicate lives
  beside the functions that BUILD those replies, because reading `/spawn <task>` and
  generalizing to `/spawn` is exactly how the listing first got through. It is not
  every host-touching argument: `task cancel` acts on the global runner but names
  nothing in its reply, and `/stop` and `/compact` are how a forum operator drives
  the Topic they are in, so refusing those would cost the forum surface with nothing
  disclosed in return. It takes the COMMAND as well as the argument because the
  normalization differs per command: `task_arg_reply` absorbs a leading `run`, so
  `/task run status` IS `status` by the time the listing is built, and both go
  through the one `normalize_task_arg` so the string dispatched on and the string
  classified cannot come apart.

## Mid-turn routing, queue receipts & cancel

A message that arrives while a turn is still generating is not a new turn: the
session semaphore is held, so running it directly would either block or open a
second conversation against the same key. Three channels carry the full
steer/queue/drain machinery — `telegram/transport_dispatch.py` (its steer-or-queue arm
in `telegram/dispatch/midturn.py`), `discord/transport_dispatch.py` and
`teams/transport_dispatch.py`; all read the
same `messaging.queue_mode` (`config/loader.py`, `"steer"` | `"queue"`, anything
else normalized to `steer`) and all implement the same three primitives
(`_handle_busy`, `_enqueue_with_receipt` + `_drain_queue`, `_handle_stop`).

The **channel-neutral half of the queue receipt is shared**, not duplicated:
`messaging/queue_receipt.py` owns the receipt registry, the lock, the three
lifecycle transitions and the receipt body formatting. Each channel reaches it
through a `ReceiptSurface` whose address is bound at construction, which is why
the shared module never sees a `chat_id` / `channel_id` / forum thread and
Telegram's forum routing stays entirely channel-local. What it does see is that
surface's `address_key` -- an opaque string, comparable and nothing else -- which is
how it can insist a bubble is only written from its own conversation without knowing
what a conversation is on any channel. `_handle_busy` and
`_drain_queue` deliberately stay per-channel: they re-enter their own
`handle_message` (whose signature differs per channel) and own the per-channel
`_active_renderers`. `_handle_stop` is NOT in that exclusion — see
[Where a command handler splits](#where-a-command-handler-splits).

**Webex** also queues, on the shared pipeline rather than a fork. `drive_turn` is
awaited and releases the session semaphore in its `finally`, so by the time the
call returns the session is free and the dispatcher drains by re-entering its own
`handle_message`. Its receipt lives on its own message, which matters here
because Webex caps edits **per message**: a receipt on a separate message has its
own allowance and never competes with the answer placeholder's reserved final
edit. Adapting rather than forking is deliberate — leaving the shared pipeline
would mean re-deriving mute substitution, identity publication, the PreToolUse
gate, the auto-approve hook and four guarded post-turn steps for one feature.

**Teams is not in the steer-only group either**, and the distinction there is the
editable-receipt affordance rather than channel maturity: the Bot Framework
Connector supports `PUT {serviceUrl}/v3/conversations/{id}/activities/{activityId}`
for a bot's own activities, so `TeamsClient.update_message` can grow one receipt
bubble in place exactly as Telegram and Discord do. Teams therefore carries the
full machinery.

The remaining channels (WeCom, Weixin, Feishu) implement `_handle_busy` as
**steer-only**: they fold the message into the running turn and reply with a
one-shot notice, or ask the user to resend when steer is unavailable. They have
no receipt and no drain because their reply is bound to the inbound request, so a
hold-then-deliver follow-up turn could not be acknowledged and delivered reliably
later.

WeCom keeps that posture even though it CAN now push proactively: a held message
would still have to be answered against a request that was already answered, so a
`/queue` directive there is refused with a resend prompt rather than silently
steered — merging text the user asked to keep separate is the one outcome worse
than refusing.

### `steer` (the default): fold into the running turn

`_handle_busy` injects the text into the in-flight turn via kiro-cli's
`_session/steer` ext-method. The write is fire-and-forget: the turn's read loop
is the single consumer of that process's stdout, so awaiting the response would
steal the turn's own messages. kiro-cli folds the steer at its next generation
boundary (a tool-call edge on an agentic turn, the end of stream on one long
text turn) and emits an inline `[STEERING steer-<id>: <ack summary>]` marker in
the text stream at the exact fold point.

Two preconditions gate the steer, and both matter:

- `provider.supports_steer` — membership in `ACP_BACKENDS_STEER`, since the
  dormant Claude backend seam has none. On this path `provider` is the
  registry's `AcpProvider`, which reports False for a backend with
  `steer_needs_loss_recovery` (codex, `ACP_BACKENDS_STEERING_REQUEST`) and
  refuses its steer, so a mid-turn channel message on a codex session always
  queues; codex's `_session/steering` is spoken only for the dashboard composer,
  which steers the inner handle. When false the message falls through to the
  queue path.
- `provider.has_active_turn()`, **not** `sessions.is_busy()`. `is_busy` stays
  true through post-turn bookkeeping (success record, turn persist, threshold
  notice, SEL audit, all await points), so it alone cannot distinguish a live
  turn from one that just ended. Steering an already-ended prompt is silently
  swallowed, which would leave the user with an acknowledgement and no answer.

On a successful steer the user's own message gets an emoji **reaction** as the
delivery receipt (`setMessageReaction` on Telegram, `add_reaction` on Discord;
both declare `reactions=True` in their `TransportCapabilities`). A reaction and
not a reply, so a mid-turn steer costs no extra bubble in the transcript. The
dispatcher also records the user's own words on the live renderer via
`note_steer` so the rendered chip quotes the user rather than the redacted
backend echo.

Attachments force the queue path on Discord: `_session/steer` carries text only,
so a mid-turn message with files would lose them.

**The dashboard composer makes the same choice per send.** While a web chat
slot is busy, `useComposerSend` (`website/src/components/chat-input/busySend.tsx`)
decides what Enter and the send button do: the split button's per-slot mode
picks between steering the running turn, queueing, and `Auto (Jev)` (the gateway
decides; offered only when the host passes `jevAutoAvailable`); in the Enter send
mode, ⌘↩ / Ctrl+Enter performs the other action for that one send; and a
`steer-only` surface (a member DM thread) has no queue and always steers.
`BusySendControls` in the same file renders that slot. `ChatInput.test.tsx` pins
steer versus queue, the one-send flip and the persisted mode, and
`ChatPane.steerOnly.test.tsx` the steer-only surface.

### `queue`: one collapsing receipt, then ONE combined turn

In `queue` mode (or under a per-message override, or when steer is unavailable)
the message is held and surfaced through a **single** receipt message that grows
in place:

```
⏳ Queued (2): "what time is it" · "and the weather?"
```

The first five items are listed verbatim (`RECEIPT_MAX_ITEMS`), the rest
collapse into `…and N more` so a large burst cannot blow the message cap.

**The receipt is EDITED, never deleted.** At the end of the turn it flips to
`▶️ Now answering (N): …`; a `/stop` finalizes it to `🛑 Cancelled (N): …`.
Neither dispatcher calls a delete API on it. This is deliberate: the receipt is
the durable record of what the user asked and how it was routed, so deleting it
would erase the only evidence that a message was accepted at all.

**A transition is published only once its edit LANDS.** `ReceiptSurface.edit_receipt`
returns whether the write landed, and each channel wrapper passes its client's own
answer through, because a refusal is an ordinary non-2xx answer rather than an
exception: a rate-limited chat, or a bubble past the per-message edit cap Webex
documents. A surface that cannot tell may return `None`; that is silence, not a
reported failure, and counts as landed -- reading it as failure would keep every
receipt in the registry for good.

A refused **grow** needs nothing further: that message is still queued, which is
exactly what the entry's lines track, so the registry and the queue still agree and
the next message's edit re-renders the whole list. Only a transition whose messages
have already LEFT the queue can strand a bubble, and for those the entry is KEPT and
becomes **terminal**, carrying `owed_bodies` -- the records it owes, oldest first. A
terminal entry is
not live (`has_receipt` reports it absent) and is never grown, because growing it
would put already-answered text back under `⏳ Queued` beside the new message; the
next mid-turn message writes the owed record first and opens a FRESH bubble. The body
travels with the entry so a retry writes the record that transition computed, and a
later transition never recomputes it: writing `🛑 Cancelled` over an owed
`▶️ Now answering` would say the opposite of what happened, permanently.

More than one record can be owed at once, and that is the point of a list. A
transition meeting an entry that already owes one is meeting a channel that is usually
still refusing, so its own record has nowhere to go either; a single slot dropped it on
the floor, and since those messages had already left the queue and a retired key is
revisited by nothing, that record reached nobody ever. It JOINS the debt instead, behind
the older one. The list is capped at `RECEIPT_MAX_OWED` at the same seam that stores a
body, so an outage cannot grow it without bound; on overflow the OLDEST is released,
because the newest record is the one that corrects what the reader can currently see.
What is released is COUNTED at that same seam and named on the next record to reach the
reader, since a shortened list is otherwise indistinguishable from a burst that produced
no such records at all.

A debt is bounded in three directions, all decided at that one seam, because each is a
way the same retention grows without end. How MUCH one holds is `RECEIPT_MAX_OWED`
above. How LONG one is held is `RECEIPT_MAX_PUBLISH_ATTEMPTS`: publications that move
nothing are counted on the entry, and past that many the debt is GIVEN UP -- emptied,
counted, and its key released. Landing a body is the ONLY thing that restarts the
allowance, and that restriction is the whole bound. Every retention past the first is
itself one of these refusals, so restarting the count when a record JOINS the debt leaves
it oscillating below the cap for as long as traffic arrives -- and the ordinary pattern is
a mid-turn message then the drain that answers it, both refused, so the case the bound
exists for is exactly the one that would never reach it. What the count measures is
refusals of the debt's OLDEST body, the only one an attempt offers before returning; the
newer records behind it share that body's fate rather than each earning an allowance,
because they are owed on the same conversation and the oldest must go first for a reader
to see them in order.

Its size is tied to `RECEIPT_MAX_OWED` because the two bounds race: a debt takes on one
record per refusal, so an allowance shorter than the records the size cap needs would give
the debt up before that cap could bite, leaving `omitted_records` describing a state
nothing reaches. Twice the size cap leaves room for the list to fill AND to shed. The
lifetime bound exists because the entry is the registry's only entry for its session key
and a key can span several conversations: one permanently unwritable chat -- the bot
removed from the thread -- would otherwise take the terminal branch on every burst
forever, so no HEALTHY sibling on that key gets a bubble or a drain record again either.
Releasing the key is what lets the next arriving message open a fresh bubble on its own
surface. What it costs is the stale `⏳ Queued` text in the conversation that takes no
writes, which no write could have corrected.

How MANY debts the registry holds is `RECEIPT_MAX_DEBTS`, enforced where the retention
happens. Attempts alone cannot reach every debt: one is retried only by a later
transition ON ITS OWN KEY, and a session key carries a `:gen{N}` generation that rotates
on reset, so an outage spanning a rotation leaves a debt nothing will ever attempt again
-- `finish_cancelled_locked` is reached only from the `/stop` handlers and clearing a
queue does not touch the registry. Past the cap the LEAST RECENTLY ATTEMPTED debt is
released. Position follows every attempt, not only every retention, because a debt refused
on each burst is the opposite of silent and still has a channel to hope for: ordering on
retentions alone would leave it at the front and evict it while an untouched orphan sat
behind it. A LIVE entry is never released -- its messages are still queued, so dropping it
strands that bubble on `⏳ Queued` and opens a second beside it.

Both releases go through one counted seam, which also releases the key, so "published"
and "given up" mean the same thing to every transition above -- this key owes nothing --
and none of them re-derives it. A drain meeting a spent debt is decided by WHOSE
conversation its own record came from. The debt's own chat: the attempt just tried an edit
and a post there, so that record has no channel either and it goes to the same seam rather
than being retained, since retaining would re-arm the very key the release freed. A
different chat sharing the key: the debt's refusals are evidence about the dead
conversation and none about this one, so that record is POSTED on its own surface and
counted lost only if that surface refuses it too. Giving it up unasked would be the exact
harm the release exists to end. The count is a WARNING log carrying the channel, the
reason, and how many records reach nobody, for the same reason the body cap counts what it
drops: a registry that quietly got smaller reads exactly like one that never owed anything.
Nothing is said to the reader, deliberately -- the conversation those records belonged to
is the one that would not take a write.

The key is released only once the record is on the bubble, because that entry is the
bubble's only handle. Editing is tried first, so the record lands in the bubble the
reader is already looking at; when the bubble refuses edits the record is POSTED as a
new message instead, since past a per-message edit cap no edit of that id will ever
land and retrying alone would owe the record for the life of the process. The stale
bubble still reading `⏳ Queued` and the posted record are together true; a silent
bubble alone is not. Several owed records publish OLDEST FIRST -- only the oldest can
take the bubble, since there is one bubble and the rest arrived after it, so each later
one is posted beneath it. Each leaves the debt only once it LANDS, one at a time, so a
failure part-way through keeps exactly what has not reached anybody and republishes
nothing.

Both of those writes go through `opened_on`, the surface the bubble was OPENED on,
and never through the surface of the transition that happens to retry it. That is the
one address in this subsystem not taken from the message in hand, and it has to be:
under `unified` the key spans several people's chats, so the arriving message may come
from a different one, while the edit targets an id valid only in the bubble's own chat
and the post arrives there as a fresh notified message. That the body is safe to show
there is established where it was BUILT -- every transition renders from
`texts_at_address` -- because at the retry there is nothing left to check it against.
An entry with no bound surface is not written at all rather than falling back to a
caller's.

The enqueue and the receipt create/grow happen together under
`ReceiptQueue.lock`, which the end-of-turn drain also takes across its dequeue
plus flip. The lock is deliberately **caller-held** rather than acquired inside
each transition (hence the `_locked` suffixes): moving the acquire inside would
read tidier and silently reintroduce the orphaned-bubble race. That is
what makes the two race-free: the drain sees either the message queued **with**
its receipt or neither yet, never a half state that would orphan a bubble.
`enqueue(..., force=False)` is a no-op once the semaphore is free, so if the
turn finished inside the window the enqueue returns false and the caller runs
the message as a fresh turn instead of stranding it.

**Queued messages collapse into ONE turn.** `_drain_queue` dequeues the whole
burst, joins the texts with blank lines in arrival order, and runs a single
combined turn, rather than replaying N separate turns. Three bounds gate the
collapse: `_MAX_COLLAPSE` (50) messages, on Discord the ingest attachment
limit across the combined set, and -- on every channel carrying a queue -- the
requirement that the entries SHARE a sender and a place. Once one item no longer
fits, it **and everything behind it** are re-enqueued so FIFO order stays exact,
the receipt notes `+N deferred`, and the drain loops to pump the remainder.
Messages arriving during the combined turn open a fresh receipt and drain after it.

`N` counts only the deferrals belonging to the sender this receipt answers. The
remainder can also hold another sender's messages and another transport's, and each
of those has -- or will have -- its own receipt; counting them here would tell one
person their own message is behind a queue that is not theirs, and would leak how
much other people are saying from a number rendered in their chat.

**One combined turn carries ONE envelope, taken from the messages and not from
the opener.** Under `dm_scope = "unified"` a single session key, and therefore a
single queue, is shared by every allow-listed person, so a queue can hold messages
from several of them. A turn replayed under the envelope that merely opened the
finished turn would be delivered to the wrong chat and attributed to the wrong
author in the transcript and audit rows. So each channel that can fold several
principals onto one queue records each queued message's own origin on its queue
entry, replays from the origin of the FIRST entry it collapses, and defers any
entry whose sender or place differs -- that entry drains next as its own turn under
its own envelope. Every channel carrying a queue now does this, and each keys the
grouping on sender and place ALONE:

- Teams (`teams/transport_dispatch.py`, `_QueuedOrigin`) excludes the per-message
  activity id.
- Telegram (`telegram/dispatch/origin.py`, `_QueuedOrigin`) records user, chat,
  Topic, chat type and the sender's `@handle`, and excludes the handle: it is a
  mutable label for a sender `user_id` already pins, so a rename between two
  messages would split one person's burst.
- Discord (`discord/transport_dispatch.py`, `_QueuedOrigin`) records user, channel
  and thread, and excludes nothing -- none of those names an individual message.
- Webex (`webex/transport_dispatch.py`, `_QueuedPlace`) records room, thread, the
  sender's email and the room type, and groups on room and thread: a Webex direct
  room is one per person, so the room already names the sender. The email and room
  type ride along because the replayed envelope needs them -- the room type is what
  the session key itself is derived from.

Including a per-message field is the trap: it would make one person's own burst
compare unequal and stop the collapse entirely, so every burst would drain as N
separate turns. Telegram and Discord avoid it structurally rather than by exclusion,
because their drains BUILD a fresh inbound message instead of copying the opener's,
so neither origin carries a message id at all.

Every drain takes the session key FIRST, and the finished turn's inbound message is
optional on all four -- a drain woken by a peer channel has no opening envelope to
be handed. Telegram and Discord take no envelope at all. Teams and Webex still
`replace` onto one because their inbound types carry fields a replay does not read,
and they fall back to a bare template built from the entry's own origin; every field
that addresses or attributes the replay is overridden from that origin either way.
So the opener's identity is not an input any drain could fall back to.

**One queue can hold more than one TRANSPORT, and neither may answer the other's.**
Every DM dispatcher is constructed with the orchestrator's single `SessionManager`,
and under `unified` the bucket is `unified:{agent}` — the channel is dropped along
with the user — so a Telegram DM and a Discord DM to the same agent resolve to the
SAME session key, and therefore the same queue. Every entry therefore records a
NEUTRAL `queued_channel` beside its channel-specific origin fields, and ownership is
read off that field alone: it is the one thing every drain can read on every entry,
and it names which peer to hand a foreign entry back to.

An entry another transport recorded carries no field this channel can address, so it
is set aside for its owner rather than replayed or dropped. It is re-enqueued
VERBATIM, and it does NOT set the defer-the-rest flag — order matters within one
sender's messages, which the sender key already keeps exact, while blocking a
channel's own queue behind a foreign entry would strand it whenever that transport
sends nothing further. Raising on a foreign entry would be worse than the defect this
contract prevents: the entry is already dequeued by then, so an exception discards
every message dequeued in that iteration. An entry naming THIS channel but missing
one of its own origin fields is a different case — a producer bug inside that
channel's own module — and raises a `KeyError` naming the field, because defaulting
would address a reply to an empty conversation id.

An entry carrying NO `queued_channel` is owned by nobody: every drain sets it aside,
and no drain is woken for it, because the tag is also what names the wake target.
Every enqueue path on all four channels writes the tag, so this shape is reachable
only from a queue persisted before this contract existed, and its entry is held
rather than answered or discarded. The alternative would be to let whichever channel
drained next claim it, which is the original defect.

**`queued_channel` answers which transport must answer an entry; it does not answer
WHOSE the entry is.** A caller-scoped `/stop` needs that second question, and the
channel tag cannot answer it: under `unified` two people on the SAME transport share
one queue, so their entries carry the same tag. Every entry therefore also records a
neutral `queued_owner` — `messaging/queue_drain.py::owner_token(channel_type,
sender_key)`, built from the very `sender_key` that already decides whether two
queued messages may collapse into one turn, so ownership and collapsing can never
answer differently. The channel name leads the token, so two transports that happen
to spell a user id the same way are still two principals, and it is built in one
place so a producer and a clear cannot disagree about the spelling. An entry
carrying NO `queued_owner` is nobody's to withdraw: every partial clear leaves it
queued rather than guessing, the same way an untagged channel makes it nobody's to
answer.

**Setting a foreign entry aside is not enough, because it was already accepted and
receipted.** A drain runs only from the tail of its own channel's turn, so a
cross-transport entry left in the queue waited for that transport to finish some
unrelated turn, and waited forever if it went quiet. `messaging/queue_drain.py` is
the wake: each dispatcher publishes "drain this session key" under its channel type,
and a drain that set entries aside calls the owner's. The registry holds channels,
not addresses — every conversation id, chat id and thread stays inside the channel
that owns it, the same boundary the receipt module keeps.

Three properties make that safe. The wake runs after the pump, so the waker's own
messages are already answered and its queue lock is released — a woken peer takes its
own lock and runs a whole turn, which must not happen under the waker's. It runs
INSIDE the waker's active marker, and that is what bounds the cascade: a woken peer
sets aside whatever the waker queued during its turn and would wake it straight back,
so a target already draining that session key is refused, and the depth is at most one
hop per peer. Those entries are not lost — they drain at their own channel's next turn
tail, the ordinary contract for any mid-turn message. And a peer whose drain raises
(its client is not connected) is logged and skipped rather than aborting the loop: the
waker has finished its own work by then, and one dead channel must not strand the
others' accepted messages.

The receipt registry itself is still keyed on the session key alone, so one bubble can
list lines from more than one conversation; that is shared cross-channel state and is
tracked in #12575. What each transition may write to it is settled, by the surface's
`address_key`: a mid-turn message from the bubble's OWN address edits it (which is
every single-conversation channel, and every member of a group space), and one from a
different address is recorded without a write. The drain's own receipt FLIP asks the
same question: it edits only when the origin it is answering addresses the bubble,
taken from that entry's origin.

The combined turn itself runs outside `ReceiptQueue.lock`, and the drain replays via
`handle_message(..., interpret_commands=False)`. Drained payloads therefore
bypass both the command intercept and override parsing, so a queued `/new`
reaches the model as literal text instead of executing on drain.

### Per-message overrides

A `steer` / `queue` directive prefix forces that one message down the
corresponding path, overriding `queue_mode` for that message only.
**Discord's text commands are `!`-prefixed** (`!new`, `!compact`, `!model`,
`!status`, `!link`, `!unlink`, `!stop`, `!help`, `!sessions`, `!queue`,
`!steer`) because Discord's client swallows a bare `/`
message into its own slash-command UI; the `/` forms are also accepted as message
text for muscle-memory parity with Telegram, which uses `/` only. Since the
registered application commands landed (below) a `/` form may arrive by EITHER
route, so both resolve through the same `parse_command`.

The prefix is recognized only when the original text is not itself a command,
and the payload after it is **turn content, never a command**: `/queue /new`
queues the literal text `/new`.

A bare `/steer` or `/queue` carrying no message body matches neither the command
parser nor the override parser, so **both channels answer it with the
directive's usage**: the alternative is handing the literal string to the model,
which then answers it as chat text, indistinguishable to the user from the
feature not existing. `is_bare_mid_turn_override` is the predicate, one per
channel (`telegram/commands.py`, and `discord/commands.py`, which matches the
token as typed because Discord has no `@BotUsername` suffix to strip), and each
dispatcher consults it under the same two gates: `interpret_as_command`, so a
caption on an attachment is never read as a bare directive and its file silently
dropped, and `override_mode is None`, because a directive that HAD a body has
already been stripped off the text. Each reply names that channel's own prefix
(`!queue <msg>` on Discord, `/queue <msg>` on Telegram).

Discord adds a second guard at the same site: an unrecognized `!token` that
Discord's own name grammar would accept gets the usage card
(`unknown_command_usage`), so a mistyped `!sesions` reads as a typo rather than
reaching the model. It is a shape test and not a list of near-misses (at least
two characters, leading letter, so `!!!`, `!?` and `!5` fall through), `!`-only
because a `/`-leading message the client did send is more likely a path than a
command, and it defers to `parse_command` and the directive alias sets so a real
command can never be answered with the card.

### A busy RESUMED dashboard session takes the slot's own machinery (Discord)

A DM bound to a dashboard session (`!sessions`, or the dashboard's mirror menu)
that messages that session mid-turn cannot use the channel's steer/queue above:
`_handle_busy` enqueues into the CHANNEL's queue, `_drain_queue` drains that queue
only at the tail of a Discord-driven turn, and the replay dispatches with resume
routing off (a drained item's affinity is native by construction) — so a message
queued there while the dashboard drives would sit until some later Discord turn
and then run in the NATIVE session. Discord's dispatcher therefore hands the
message to the dashboard slot instead (`_handle_resumed_busy` →
`dashboard/channel_handoff.py::hand_to_resumed_slot`), under the same mode ladder
(the `!queue`/`!steer` override, else `messaging.queue_mode`):

- **steer** → `chat_delivery.steer_into_running_turn` on the slot's published
  client, the injection the dashboard composer uses, with `user_origin=True`
  (the owner gate on resume makes the author the session's own human) and
  `channel_origin=True`, recording the same **audience fence** the peer-steer
  path records (`slot._steer_audience_fences`, the containment holding at
  admission, recorded before the RPC and kept for the whole turn, so the
  publisher's `cross_surface_withheld` withholds the reply's cross-surface leg
  when a constraint newly holds). The channel's records are **bounded**: keyed
  by the audience (`channel_handoff.audience_fence_key`, a digest of the
  containment snapshot) rather than by message, so a turn that takes many
  Discord steers holds one record per distinct audience, re-recording the same
  audience is a no-op, the set shares `MAX_PENDING_STEERS` with the other
  per-steer stores, and the turn's teardown clears it. At the cap a new
  audience is never recorded over an existing fence — a dropped fence is a
  cross-surface leg published that should have been withheld — and the message
  is not refused for it either: it takes the queue arm, which records no fence
  and is already where a declined steer goes. **The fence follows the message
  into the turn**: every admission under an audience counts a holder
  (`_ChatSlot._steer_audience_fence_holders`), a steer whose text does not enter
  the running turn — unavailable or declined before or after the RPC, requeued by
  the teardown to run as its own turn — releases its hold, and the record is
  popped once no holder remains. A fence a landed sibling relies on therefore
  survives another steer's decline, while a fence for text that never reached
  the turn cannot withhold that turn's cross-surface leg — the release the peer
  path performs on its per-token record when it is not steered (see
  session-control). The release is bound to the turn the steer was admitted to
  (`slot._turn_generation`, captured before the RPC, as the peer path binds its
  stop): a steer that wakes after that turn's teardown finds its hold already
  cleared with the maps, and a record under the same audience key belongs to the
  next turn's steers, so it releases nothing. The peer path's containment STOP is not repeated:
  it narrows a delivery a gate authorized against containment, and a human's own
  message has no such gate. A codex client (`steer_needs_loss_recovery`) is not
  steered — the composer accepts that a denied approval can drop a steer because
  its human watches the turn; a channel human cannot see the dashboard's turn —
  and a declined or unavailable steer falls through to the queue. **The RPC
  suspends and the slot can move under it**, so after it the key is resolved
  again and compared by object identity, as `send_to_target` re-gates its own
  fallback. A moved slot is not refused outright, because the text may already
  be somewhere that runs it: a close during the RPC cancels the turn, whose
  teardown requeues the pending steer onto the queue the close archives
  (`queued_prompts`), and that entry drains when the session is next resumed —
  a refusal there reads as "NOT delivered" to a human who then resends and runs
  the text twice. `channel_handoff.standing_after_move` reads the queue and
  turn RECORDS of both objects, for every RPC outcome, by the **delivery id**
  the hand-off mints and hands to `steer_into_running_turn` (which writes it
  into the pending registration, the requeued entry's durable
  `meta.steer_delivery_id`, the drained row's `steer_delivery_ids`, and the
  steer's own row) — never by content, since a slot recreated under the same
  key restores its whole prior transcript and a recurring short message would
  prove a delivery that never happened; never by timing. The slot the text was
  HANDED TO is judged first, successor or not — an accepted steer left its row
  there, a teardown requeue its entry, a suspended registration its id, and a
  successor knows none of that; only when it holds nothing does the successor
  answer. The successor's queue carries the id → the ordinary queued
  confirmation; the successor's transcript carries it → `✅ Delivered to that
  session — it was reopened while your message was in flight, and the message
  ran there as its own turn.`; the queue the close ARCHIVED carries the id — read off the
  persistence layer's own witness, `queue_persist_pending` False with the entry
  present, because the close saves the popped slot once and nothing revisits a
  popped object → `⏳ Queued for that session — it closed while your message
  was in flight; the message runs when the session is next resumed.`; the id
  held only in memory on the handed-to slot (the pending registration, a requeue
  the archive missed, a row appended after the save) → refused with
  `REFUSED_UNSAVED_CLOSE` (`⏳ That session closed while your message was in
  flight, and the message had not been saved with it yet. If it does not run once
  the session is reopened, send it again.`); no record carries the id (a
  declined steer's unwound registration, an entry left on the detached object
  while a live successor holds the key, a hard stop's cleared pending list) →
  refused (`REFUSED_MOVED`, `⏳ That session changed while your message was in
  flight …`). The fallback never appends to the detached object, and on an
  unmoved slot it re-runs the admission gate, since a slot that went idle or
  started closing during the RPC can no longer take the text. The queue arm
  itself is bounded: at `MAX_LIVE_QUEUE_ENTRIES` the hand-off refuses before the
  append (`REFUSED_QUEUE_FULL`, `⏳ That session's queue is full, so this
  message was NOT added …`) rather than appending past the bound or evicting a
  waiting entry, the shape every producer guarding the live queue takes.
  **A channel steer narrows the running turn's directive provenance.** The
  turn's `_directive_channel_origin` is its opener's — False for a
  dashboard-driven turn — and every directive the model emits is stamped with
  it (`apply_session_directive`'s `producer_is_channel`); a channel human's text
  injected mid-turn can shape the `monitor_watch` the model emits next, so
  unchanged the stamp would hand a channel-shaped input the dashboard's
  authority. `steer_into_running_turn(channel_origin=True)` therefore sets the
  slot's `_turn_channel_narrowed` at admission — before the RPC, since the client
  can inject the text and the model can act on it before the RPC returns — and
  the turn reads that flag beside its opener's provenance at both
  directive-application sites for the remainder of the turn, so a directive
  emitted after channel text reached the turn is filed as channel-created, the
  authority a channel-origin turn's directive carries. The narrowing holds even
  when the steer is declined or requeued (narrowing is the direction that cannot
  be wrong; a requeued text runs as its own channel-origin turn), and the turn
  resets it at its end and at the next turn's start, whose provenance is its own
  opener's. The composer's own steer narrows nothing.
- **queue** → `chat_delivery.queue_for_next_turn` on the slot's queue, drained by
  the dashboard turn loop (so ordering is the dashboard's and the Discord-side
  drain never sees the entry), stamped with the drain's admission snapshot and
  BOTH provenance marks a channel human's text carries on the Slack
  linked-thread path: `_directive_user_origin` and `_directive_channel_origin`
  (channel authority is the narrower credential boundary, so a directive the
  drained turn issues is filed as channel-created). A steer the turn never
  consumed is requeued with the same two marks, through the slot's lockstep
  `_steer_channel_origin` map. The entry also carries the sending conversation
  as its **drop-notice recipient** (`session_control.channel_recipient_meta`:
  channel type, conversation id, and — for a DM route only — the platform user
  the channel authorized on inbound; a thread route supplies no principal, so
  `may_send_to` answers it from the thread roster alone and a thread since
  removed from `allowed_thread_ids` refuses the notice instead of passing the DM
  arm on a user roster it was never checked against), on the queue entry directly — `queue_for_next_turn`'s singular
  `channel_recipient` parameter writes that one key beside the containment
  stamp, which nothing passed there can reach — and, for a steer, through the
  admission dict the requeue copies. When the drain's re-validation drops the entry
  (`chat_runner._drop_stale_admissions`), `notify_channel_recipient_dropped`
  schedules a notice into that conversation — the DM was told "queued" and reads
  neither the target's transcript nor the SEL — through the same cross-surface
  send ladder every proactive channel delivery takes (channels governance, a
  registered proactive transport, the recipient re-check with the stamped
  principal, since a dashboard session key names no channel peer); a revoked
  recipient gets no notice, and the quoted excerpt takes the egress redaction.
  The stamp names a write target on a network surface, so
  `sanitize_restored_queue` strips it like the dashboard sender stamp: a drop
  after a restart is reported nowhere rather than to whoever an edited line named.

**The hand-off runs as one task, awaited through `asyncio.shield`.** The caller
is the channel's message handler, and a transport close cancels those handlers
as an ordinary path (Discord gathers its handler tasks on close). Awaited inline,
that cancellation lands inside `steer_into_running_turn`'s RPC: the pending
registration is made, the client may already have accepted the text, and
everything behind the RPC — the transcript row for an accepted steer, the unwind
of a declined one, the fallback to the queue — is skipped, so accepted text runs
with no row while the per-steer maps keep its entry for the slot's lifetime (the
`steering_consumed` settle removes the pending entry and patches an existing row;
the turn's teardown requeues only UNconsumed steers). Shielded, the caller's
cancellation cancels the shield's outer future alone: the hand-off task — gate,
RPC, reconciliation, fallback — completes, held by a strong reference
(`channel_handoff._HANDOFFS_IN_FLIGHT`, since the loop keeps only weak references
to its tasks) that the task's done callback releases on every completion, and
the caller unwinds without the outcome, so no confirmation reaches the closing
DM. The audience fence recorded before the RPC is not the hand-off's to release:
it is the audience's record for the turn and the turn's teardown clears it.

Every outcome is confirmed in the DM (`↪️ Steering that session …` /
`⏳ Queued for that session …`): a dashboard-driven turn's reply reaches the DM,
if at all, through the dashboard's own cross-surface leg and not through this
dispatcher, so a silent hand-off would read as a drop. The refusal (`⏳ That session is busy with a turn started elsewhere …`)
stays for the cases the slot cannot take (`slot_unable_to_take`, fail-closed on
an attribute the slot cannot answer): no open slot for the key, a closing slot, a
remote-bound slot (no local drain), and a slot that is NOT itself driving the
turn (`running or _in_stage_execution` false while the lease is held — Discord's
own turn on the resumed key is that case; the slot then has no client to steer
into, no drain coming, and the queue-or-run admission would start a second turn
against the held lease). A message carrying attachments is refused with wording
that names them: `_session/steer` carries text only, and the slot's queue cannot
carry Discord attachment material (temp files owned by the consuming turn, which
the dashboard drain has no hook to own), so the files stay with the user instead
of being dropped or answered without. Discord-native conversations keep
`_handle_busy` unchanged; Telegram's resumed branch still refuses.

### Hard cancel: `/stop`

`/stop` (alias `/cancel`; `!stop` / `!cancel` on Discord) aborts the running
turn, drops the CALLER's queued messages, and withdraws that caller's lines from
the receipt -- finalizing it to `🛑 Cancelled` only once nothing else is queued.
`clear_queue` and the receipt finalize run together under `ReceiptQueue.lock`.
All of that, including both reply strings, is
`messaging/commands.py::stop_running_turn(sessions, session_key, *, queue,
surface, owner, deliver)`; a dispatcher supplies the session key, its bound
`ReceiptSurface`, the caller's owner token and a `deliver` that sends one reply
to the caller's own address and hands back what landed.

**The queue drop is the CALLER's, not the session's.** Under `unified` one queue
holds several principals, so `clear_queue` takes an ownership predicate over an
entry's kwargs and drops only the entries whose `queued_owner` matches. Everybody
else's messages stay queued and still owed an answer. `owner` has no default, so
a channel wired up later cannot inherit a whole-queue clear by leaving it out;
omitting the predicate at `clear_queue` still clears everything, which is what
the whole-session callers mean (`/new`, a generation bump, teardown). The receipt
follows, and what it may WRITE is bounded by the fact that one bubble can carry
lines from several conversations while its `msg_id` addresses a message in exactly
one of them -- the one it was OPENED in. `ReceiptSurface` therefore carries an
`address_key`, built by `receipt_address_key` from the very values the channel's own
edit call addresses a message with (Telegram's `chat_id`, Discord's `channel_id`,
Teams' `service_url` + `conversation_id`, Webex's `room_id`), and every write rule
below is decided on that key rather than on who is calling. Each part comes from the
provider's own inbound payload, so the key names a conversation the provider
assigned; a missing part makes it EMPTY, which reads as unknown and matches nothing,
not even another empty one. A surface that cannot name its address opens no bubble at
all -- without a key every later write would have to guess which chat the `msg_id`
belongs to, and a wrong guess rewrites a stranger's message.

Deciding on the address is what makes the rule true on both shared-key routes at
once. Under `dm_scope = "unified"` two people's DMs share a session key and bind
DIFFERENT chats, so neither may write to the other's; in a GROUP SPACE (`space:{room_id}`,
shared under any scope) every member's surface binds the SAME room, so a second
member's message both may and must update the one shared bubble. A test on who is
calling cannot tell those apart -- it is the same "somebody else" in both, and
treating the group-space member as a stranger leaves their message recorded but
never shown.

So a caller-scoped `/stop` withdraws the caller's lines from the record, and writes
only when the caller's surface addresses the bubble: it finalizes as `🛑 Cancelled`
over the caller's own withdrawn lines, never over what remains, which may have
arrived from another chat. A SECOND condition precedes that one and has nothing to do
with addressing: while the bubble's OWN chat still has lines listed on it, nothing is
written and the entry stays LIVE. Those messages are still queued, so "Cancelled"
would say they went -- and retiring the key would strand the bubble on `⏳ Queued` for
good, because the later drain finds no entry to flip and the next burst opens a second
bubble beside the stale one. Lines from another chat do not hold the bubble: they were
never rendered on it, so it owes them nothing and is finalized without them.

The entry is dropped once it owes nothing, and a refused final edit does not by itself
create a debt: the record is POSTED at the bubble's own address right away, because a
retained body is written only by a LATER transition and a burst that ends at that
refusal would otherwise leave the bubble asserting `⏳ Queued` over messages that were
answered or cleared, with no path that ever corrects it. The stale bubble plus the
posted record are together true. The entry is RETAINED only when that post fails too,
and then it is terminal and carries what it owes. A refused GROW is the branch that
matches this shape and must NOT take it: its message is still queued, so it owes no
record and a post would announce something that has not happened.

What keeps a later transition safe is therefore not the drop but the ADDRESS: an owed
record is written through `opened_on`, the surface the bubble was opened on, so no
transition is ever handed an id minted in a different chat -- `edit_message`
addresses a message by its per-chat id pair, and in another conversation the same
number is an unrelated message. That address also decides where the POST lands: it
arrives as a fresh notified message, and on a channel with forum Topics in the Topic's
own send address rather than the parent chat. A terminal entry keeps only the records it
owes -- `terminalize` drops `lines` at the same moment, so the bound on what is
retained is applied where the retention happens rather than at a render site below it,
each body is already bounded by the item cap and the per-item truncation, and how MANY
are held is bounded at that same seam. A retained
entry is not live and is never grown, so a later burst opens a fresh bubble instead of
joining this one. A mid-turn message meeting a terminal entry therefore gets no bubble
of its own yet and its line is not recorded either: no path reads a terminal entry's
lines, so keeping them would change nothing a reader sees while holding a verbatim burst
for as long as the channel refuses. Nothing is lost by that -- the caller enqueued
before calling and the drain renders its record from what it dequeued -- and the
residual is one missing `⏳ Queued` acknowledgement -- one per message that arrives while
the debt is held, which is exactly what `RECEIPT_MAX_PUBLISH_ATTEMPTS` bounds the number
of.

Retiring an owed record does not retire the transition that retried it. A drain
meeting a terminal entry publishes the OLDER record first -- writing this turn's words
over what happened would say the opposite, permanently -- and once that lands the
bubble is spent, so this turn's own record has no bubble left to edit and is POSTED
beside it. The entry REMEMBERS that, because publishing a debt is resumable: a channel
that recovers part-way lands the oldest record and then refuses the next, and a later
retry that edited would erase the record the reader can already see and show the two in
the wrong order. Publication is what spends the bubble, by either route -- a record that
had to be posted sits BELOW the bubble, so the bubble is no longer ahead of it.
Returning there instead would lose the drained burst's receipt for good: a
retired key is revisited by nothing, and those messages have already left the queue.
When the older record cannot be published at all, this turn's record is RETAINED behind
it rather than dropped: that failure already tried an edit and a post, so a post for
this body would fail the same way, and the debt is the only thing left that can carry
it. The post, and that retention, are both withheld when the drain belongs to a
different chat, because then its body is that chat's text.

Which conversation a shared bubble belongs to is NOT settled here: it stays with the
receipt registry's own key, which is `session_key` alone (#12575). What IS settled is
that no write takes an address the bubble does not have, and that no body written
there quotes a line from another conversation -- every rendered body comes from
`texts_at_address`, the lines that arrived at the bubble's own address, so a
whole-session cancel shows one DM's line under a unified scope and the whole room's
under a group space. The remaining transitions each answer the same question. An owed
record reads `opened_on` outright. The end-of-turn flip is addressed: one drained turn
carries ONE envelope -- same sender, same chat, same Topic -- so a flip arriving on
another chat's surface is answering that chat's messages, and writing it here would
quote their text; nothing is stranded by staying silent, because those messages are
still queued, which is why the entry goes back LIVE rather than being dropped.

A flip addressed to the bubble has a SECOND condition before it retires the key, and it
is the partial stop's condition asked at the other transition: while a line belonging to
ANOTHER principal is still listed at the bubble's own address, the bubble is re-rendered
as `⏳ Queued` over what remains and the entry stays LIVE. A shared ADDRESS makes this
ordinary rather than an edge -- a group space gives every member one session key and one
receipt address, so both members' lines sit on the one bubble and the flip is addressed
by either of them -- while the drain still answers ONE principal per turn. Retiring the
key there wrote `▶️ Now answering (1)` over a list of two: an acknowledgement erased for
a message still on the queue, and then no record for it at all, because that entry was
its only handle and its own later drain finds nothing to flip. So the flip is told WHOSE
messages it answered (the same owner token the queue entries carry) and takes only those
lines off the list; every drain passes it, pinned by a source check, because a channel
wired up later cannot be covered by a behavioural test written now. It is told HOW MANY of
that principal's the drain put back as well, and keeps their newest that many rather than
dropping as many lines as it answered texts: a queued message does not always open a line
here -- a refused `send_receipt` opens no bubble at all, and a message arriving while the
entry owes a record is not retained -- so a principal can hold fewer lines than they have
messages queued, and a positional count would then consume a line whose message is still
queued, which is the erasure this whole condition exists to prevent. Counting from the
newest end is what makes the two numbers unable to disagree, and where it is still
ambiguous it keeps: a line left listed is re-rendered by the next transition, a line
removed is gone. A refused re-render owes no record, exactly as a refused grow does not:
those messages have not left the queue.

Two remainders deliberately do NOT hold the bubble. A line at another ADDRESS was never
rendered on it, so it is owed nothing and is excluded by the same `texts_at_address`
every body here is built from. And the answered principal's OWN messages past the
collapse cap are answered by that same principal's very next drain, which the flip body
already states as `+N deferred` -- so that contract stands unchanged, and the third
category is named in `others_at_address` rather than left implicit.

A **grow** from another conversation is the one case with no correct address at all.
The bubble's chat would receive this sender's text, which this module has always
refused; this sender's own chat holds no bubble, so the per-chat `msg_id` names an
unrelated message there and the whole line list would overwrite it, permanently. So
the line is RECORDED and nothing is written. That costs only a bubble not yet showing
this line, because a grow owes no record: the message is still queued, and the next
render in its own chat shows it. A grow from the SAME address -- the group-space
member, and every single-conversation channel -- edits as before.

The running turn is cancelled whoever it belongs to: a session records the
asyncio task holding it, not the sender that task is answering. `session.cancelled`
is likewise left alone by a caller-scoped clear, because its bare message
timestamps say nothing about whose they are.

**Cancel is cooperative before it is fatal.** The shared handler calls
`provider.cancel(wait_ack_timeout=0)`, which writes an ACP `session/cancel`
notification and returns without waiting, so the acknowledgement to the user is
immediate; the turn stops at its next safe point. Per the ACP spec the ack is
not a response to that notification, it arrives as `stopReason: "cancelled"` on
the `session/prompt` response. The client arms a cancel grace window
(`_CANCEL_GRACE_SECS`, 10s floor, raised to the caller's budget when larger) and
only treats the agent as unresponsive after it elapses. The dashboard and Slack
Stop paths go through `SessionManager.stop_turn`, which waits out
`agent.soft_stop_budget_secs` (default 10.0, clamped to [0.5, 60]) for that ack
and escalates to a hard kill plus eager respawn only on timeout or error. See
`../../architecture/design-notes/soft-stop.md`.

On a shared runtime the cooperative cancel cannot force-kill a co-tenant
process, which is why the soft path exists at all rather than always killing.

**The dashboard composer renders the same soft-then-hard stop.** While a turn
runs, `BusySendControls` (`website/src/components/chat-input/busySend.tsx`)
replaces the send button with the stop for the phase the host reports: an armed
Stop, a pulsing force-kill while the soft stop is pending, a disabled spinner
while the kill runs, and a force-reset once `useStopEscapeHatch` sees that kill
outlive 15 s. Every press is the host's `onStop`; the composer only renders the
phase. `ChatInput.test.tsx` and `integration/ChatFooter.integration.test.tsx` pin
the phases, and `stopButtonEscalation.test.tsx` the 15 s force-reset.

### Where a command handler splits

A dispatcher's command handler is two things welded together: a **decision**
(what the grant becomes, whether a turn was actually cancelled, how long a login
link lives, which bindings a rebind displaces) and a **send**, which needs a
`chat_id`, a `channel_id`, or a `(conversation_id, serviceUrl)` pair. The
decision half is identical across channels and is shared; only the send stays
behind. Every shared handler therefore **returns the reply text rather than
sending it** — the shape `release_conversation_location` already used — so a
user-facing string has exactly one owner.

| Command | Shared half | Per-channel half |
|---|---|---|
| `/stop` | `commands.stop_running_turn(sessions, session_key, *, queue, surface, owner, deliver) -> str` | the `deliver` that performs the send and reports what landed; which session key a resumed conversation stops; the caller's `owner_token` |
| `/yolo` | `commands.run_yolo_command(arg, *, source, caller, phrasing) -> str` | the send; `source` (also the grant's audit source), the trusted `caller`, and a `YoloPhrasing` |
| `/link` | `link.rebind_conversation_location(sessions, *, key, location, unlink_command) -> str` | the send; `location` (the channel's one spelling of "this conversation"); any refusal only a resume-capable channel can hit |
| `/unlink` | `link.release_conversation_location(sessions, *, key, location, channel) -> (str, swept)` | the send; the opt-out write ordered before it; any dashboard nudge for a swept binding |
| dashboard link | `commands.parse_dashboard_ttl(arg, *, parse_duration) -> int`, `commands.format_ttl` | the command GRAMMAR — which word the TTL is (Telegram's `parse_dashboard_argument` reads the third; Teams' `/dashboard <ttl>` the second) |

Four constraints shape those signatures:

- **No address reaches `messaging/commands.py`.** It takes no `chat_id`,
  `channel_id`, `conversation_id` or thread, and reaches a receipt bubble only
  through the already-bound `ReceiptSurface`. That is what keeps Telegram's forum
  routing and Teams' service URLs channel-local, and a parameter named for one
  channel's address is how the module would acquire its first per-channel branch.
- **Command spellings are data, not prose.** A channel that renders inline code
  writes `` `/yolo on` `` where Telegram writes `/yolo on`; the two spellings are
  `YOLO_PHRASING_PLAIN` / `YOLO_PHRASING_MARKDOWN` and the `unlink_command`
  argument, so a channel picks a value instead of restating the sentence —
  restating it is how three copies drifted.
- **No word count crosses a channel boundary.** `parse_dashboard_ttl` takes the
  already-extracted ARGUMENT, never the message, because indexing into the split
  text would read one channel's grammar on another's behalf.
- **`parse_duration` is injected, not imported.** It lives in
  `dashboard/token_auth.py`, and `kiro_crew.messaging` imports nothing from
  `kiro_crew.dashboard` at any nesting depth (`test_messaging_commands.py`
  scans for it, deferred in-function imports included).

Two things deliberately stay duplicated. `_handle_busy` and `_drain_queue`
re-enter their own `handle_message`, whose signature differs per channel, and own
the per-channel `_active_renderers` (see
[queue receipts](#mid-turn-routing-queue-receipts--cancel)). And `/yolo` has no
Discord counterpart at all: Discord renders real Approve/Deny buttons, so an
out-of-band grant is not what makes tools usable there the way it is on Teams.

### Streaming and steer rotation in the renderers

Both renderers stream a turn live through one real message edited in place
(throttled frames, a transient `🔧 {tool}…` footer during tool calls, trailing
`[OPTIONS:]` markup held back from live frames), and rotate to a new message at
the driver's structured steer boundary. Telegram seals segments to Telegram-HTML
and caps source at 4000 chars; Discord sends markdown as-is and caps at 1900,
under the platform's 2000 hard limit.

At a rotation the pre-steer output **seals** as its own message and the
continuation opens a fresh message headed by a chip quoting the marker's ack
summary (falling back to the user's own steer text recorded by `note_steer`):

```
> ↪️ answered the weather question in parallel with the directory summary
<steered continuation…>
```

**The chip is lazily materialized.** `_materialize_chip` prepends it only once
real post-steer text exists in the segment, so a marker at the very end of the
stream (the steer was already covered by the answer) posts **no tail message at
all** and the reaction remains the only acknowledgement. Without the laziness
every trailing steer would leave a chip-only bubble carrying no content.

A trailing `[OPTIONS:]` block belongs to the visible pre-steer answer, so it is
extracted before the seal and shipped as a keyboard on the sealed message,
rather than frozen as literal protocol text the user cannot act on. Length
overflow rotates too, fence-balanced so a code block spanning the cut is closed
at the seal and reopened after it, with a trailing incomplete directive detached
before the split. Discord gets that from the shared `split_markdown_safe`, whose
final chunk is deliberately left open as the live buffer; Telegram still carries
its own splitter. Raw markers never reach posted text; each renderer keeps a
defensive raw-marker parser only for callers that bypass `TurnDriver`.

## Session privacy modes (`privacy_mode.py`)

`!temporary` (blank-slate: no memory reads, no writes, no persistence) and
`!incognito` (reads allowed, writes blocked, ephemeral log discarded on close)
were Slack-only machinery in `slack/handler.py`. The channel-neutral core lives
here so a second channel inherits the trackers, the durable flag and the audit
rather than a second copy of them; `slack/handler.py` keeps every public symbol
(`is_thread_temporary`, `is_thread_incognito`, `_is_slack_restricted`,
`maybe_apply_privacy_modifiers`) as a thin wrapper, with `_thread_temporary` /
`_thread_incognito` as **aliases of the shared objects**, not copies. The
predicate and tracker aliases sit on `slack/handler.py` itself; the wrapper
functions (`_is_slack_restricted`, `_hydrate_conv_flags`, `_apply_privacy_mode`,
`maybe_apply_privacy_modifiers`) are defined in `slack/handler_runtime/inbound.py`
and composed onto it.

- **Keyed by session key, never by a platform thread id.** That is what lets one
  copy serve a Slack thread ts, a Telegram DM route and a forum Topic, and it is
  why `is_restricted(session_key)` answers correctly for a
  `telegram:{agent}:direct:{user}` key. `PRIVACY_LRU_MAX` (10,000) bounds each
  tracker; eviction is least-recently-marked.
- **`hydrate(sessions, session_key)`** rebuilds the process-local trackers from
  the durable `SessionMap` flag (the mode name IS the flag name), so a mode
  survives a gateway restart. `conv_state_map` requires the real `SessionMap`
  class rather than any attribute: a `MagicMock` stand-in returns a **truthy mock**
  for every flag, which would mark every session both temporary and incognito —
  failing closed, but wrongly and silently.
- **Two durable records, two readers.** The `SessionMap` flag is what `hydrate`
  restores the channel's own gate from on every inbound message, and it keeps
  the map entry alive through `SessionMap.prune` and the per-read repair (both
  loop-side and lock-held, so neither reads a transcript) -- and through every
  other path: because this gate hydrates from the map alone, a flagged row is
  never removed, however complete the transcript header, until the gate can
  read the header (a separate change). `SessionMap.stamp_privacy_headers` --
  awaited by `start_pool` right after `prune`, the header probes on a worker
  thread, the map-lock-held half touching no file, each row re-read and stamped
  under the session's durable-write lock (`_serialized`, below) so a release
  landing after its snapshot is never re-stamped -- only ensures each flagged
  row's existing transcript header carries the mode.
  The transcript header's `memory_mode` is the record the memory readers
  consult: `apply_mode` stamps it through `_persist_transcript_mode`
  (`ConversationLog.update_metadata_if` on the default `ConversationLog`, off the
  loop, and READ BACK -- the writer's answer is not the record) so a transcript read never depends on the map being loaded,
  and every memory reader already refuses on that field (`is_incognito_transcript`
  behind the consolidator's pre-snapshot check, the transcript derivation seam and
  the publication hold around each durable write, the consolidate route's header
  read, and the dashboard's persisted probe). Tighten-only: a `!incognito` typed after
  `!temporary` leaves `temporary` in place -- and the compare reads the header's
  mode NORMALIZED (`history.transcript_privacy_mode`, the companion of
  `is_incognito_transcript`: same `lower()`, same set, the mode returned), so a
  header a hand edit or a foreign writer spelled `Temporary` is the stricter mode
  it is, not an unknown string that would lose to the incognito stamp; the
  startup stamp (`SessionMap.stamp_privacy_headers`) and the consolidate route's
  header read go through the same helper, and every reader agrees with
  the predicate on every input (whitespace is not stripped by either: a header no
  reader recognizes is one the stamps may repair with a recognized mode). Both
  stamps decide through `needs_tightening(current, mode)`, which is False at
  equality as well as for a stricter header, so a header that already records the
  mode costs no write -- the startup stamp visits every flagged row on every boot,
  and a restart re-applies a modifier from an empty tracker. Upserted: a thread flagged before its
  first turn gets a metadata-only header — the mode marker, no user-authored
  content, the same shape `bind_session_execution` writes for a restricted
  session — and `ConversationLog.append` keeps an existing header, so the first
  row any later writer appends lands under it. This is not the `/title` defect
  below: the header carries the mode and nothing the user typed. A thread flagged
  before the stamp existed is covered by its map entry, and the startup step
  copies the mode into its existing transcript's header while the row stays.
- **`apply_mode(mode, session_key, *, source, caller, resources, sessions, notify,
  on_applied) -> bool`** is idempotent and returns whether the mode was NEWLY
  applied. The application itself is **`_commit_mode`**, the ONE path from a
  request to a published mode, and it publishes in one order: the durable map
  row is written and its write AWAITED to disk (`_land`: `set_flag`, then
  `aflush`); then the durable transcript header (`_persist_transcript_mode`,
  tighten-only) -- the record the out-of-process gates read
  (`capture_session_execution` takes an absent `memory_mode` as `persistent`,
  and MCP `register_hook`, the task runner and workflow memory decide on it), so
  a header write that fails, or returns with the header NOT recording the mode,
  is the same refusal as a row that cannot land. The writer's answer is consumed
  and read past: `update_metadata_if` has two silent no-write answers -- `False`
  for a damaged first line it cannot read (the same answer as "already at least
  this strict") and `True` for a first line that is valid JSON but not the
  metadata record (a legacy message-first transcript), which it skips -- so the
  stamp reads the header back and raises `HeaderNotRecorded` unless it carries
  at least the mode. Either way the
  row is taken back (`_land` to the value it had BEFORE the commit, never forced
  off: after a restart a re-sent modifier commits over a row already on disk,
  and clearing it would erase the thread's one durable private record) and the message is
  NOT processed; only then the in-memory mark, the audit
  (`f"{source}.{mode}_mode"`), the caller's `on_applied` hook and the notice. A
  task cancelled during the header write publishes nothing in-process -- the
  write itself completes on its worker thread beside the row, and the next
  inbound `hydrate` restores the mark. A row the map refuses (`SessionMap.PRIVACY_ROW_CAP`
  reached, a key over `PRIVACY_ROW_KEY_MAX`), cannot write or land, or whose
  header cannot be written (`persist_failed`) publishes NOTHING: one SEL `denied` record
  (`private_session_refused:<reason>:<target>`), `refusal_notice` (the mode was
  not applied, the message was NOT processed, nothing ran and nothing was
  saved), then `PrivacyModeRefused` -- no mark, no header, no mode-on notice, the
  flag out of the map's memory again, so no record claims a mode the next boot
  would not find. A header the writer SKIPPED -- the transcript's first line is
  a message, not a metadata record (the legacy shape `update_metadata_if`
  deliberately leaves alone) -- is the same refusal under its own reason,
  `header_legacy`, because no retry can land it: its notice names the remedy
  ("Start a new thread and send it there with the modifier") where
  `persist_failed`'s says try again; migrating a metadata record onto legacy
  transcripts is a separate change. There is no best-effort form: the mark that used to precede the
  write and survive its failure is exactly what a restart lost, under a notice
  that said the mode was on. The caller must not run the turn: the Slack applier
  answers `only_modifier=True` (the contract both Slack callers already honour
  by returning), the Telegram command and turn paths return, and the Telegram
  steer path RESERVES before it steers. Refusing is the fail-closed answer;
  running the message with the mode silently dropped would be the leak the
  modifier exists to prevent, and evicting a retained row to make room would run
  THAT thread as persistent after a restart. While the row is landing the key is
  HELD, not published: the first caller for a (mode, key) registers the group in
  `_pending` before its first await, and `is_temporary` / `is_incognito` /
  `is_restricted` answer restricted for a held key beside the
  trackers, so a message arriving mid-write runs restricted rather than
  persistent; nothing is announced, and the hold is gone with a write that
  fails. `hydrate` restores only a row the map holds durably -- a flag whose
  commit is still in flight is skipped, since marking it would publish a row the
  write may yet fail to land. A concurrent second `apply_mode` for the same
  (mode, key) joins the group and waits instead of re-committing (one row, one
  audit, one notice), and because its message runs under the mode it COMMITS the
  group, as does a plain modifier arriving while a reservation is pending on an
  already-marked key. The shape is pinned structurally by
  `test_messaging_privacy_mode`: `set_flag` and `aflush` are called nowhere but
  `_land`; `_persist_transcript_mode` nowhere but `_commit_mode`, after `_land`
  and before `mark`; `mark` nowhere but `_commit_mode`, `hydrate` and the
  two in-memory wrappers; `_tracker(...).pop` nowhere but `_release_mode`; and no
  module outside `privacy_mode` calls a publication function or writes a privacy
  flag.
- **`reserve(mode, session_key, …) -> Reservation`**, **`commit(reservation)`**,
  **`release(reservation, *, sessions, source, …)`** — the form for a caller about
  to take a step it cannot take back. `reserve` is `_commit_mode` plus the
  bookkeeping a release needs: the group is HELD (a holder counted) and the
  header the transcript carried before is remembered; a session already in the
  mode is held without a second application and left exactly as it was by a
  later release. The group for a (mode, key) is registered BEFORE `reserve`'s
  first await, so a concurrent second caller always finds it, joins it and waits
  for the first application to settle instead of running its own — no window in
  which two callers each hold "the only" reservation and the loser's release
  erases the winner's committed mode; a failed first application retires the
  group and the joiner registers one of its own. A landed step `commit`s; a step
  that did not land `release`s through **`_release_mode`**, the mirror of the
  primitive, which loosens the records in the OPPOSITE order to the commit: the
  transcript header is restored first, then the map flag is cleared and its
  write AWAITED (`_land`), and only then is the tracker mark dropped and the
  reversal reported, one SEL `released` record beside the `allowed` one. The
  row goes LAST because it is the record a restart trusts -- `hydrate` restores
  the mark from the map row alone, and the startup sweep re-stamps headers FROM
  rows, never rows from headers -- so a sequence that stops anywhere leaves the
  next boot reading the mode. The
  header is restored to the STRICTEST claim still standing (`_restore_target`):
  the mode it recorded before this reservation (normalized) and every OTHER mode
  still recorded for the session -- in a tracker, in the map, or held in flight
  -- never a bare `persistent` while another mode holds the conversation, so a
  `temporary` reservation released after an `incognito` one committed leaves the
  header at `incognito` (restoring the released mode's own `header_before` alone
  wrote `persistent` there, which every header-only reader took at its word).
  Written only if the header still records the released mode, and READ BACK. A
  header restore that raises, or that leaves the header still recording the
  released mode when its target was another value (the writer's silent
  no-write answers, `HeaderNotRecorded`), RETAINS the mode with NOTHING
  loosened yet -- the row and the mark stand as they were; a clear that cannot
  reach disk RETAINS it too -- the flag is back in the map's memory (its next
  write retries), the mark never left, and the header loosened a step earlier is
  re-stamped with the mode (`_persist_transcript_mode`, tighten-only, best
  effort in the safe direction: where that fails too the row still says the
  mode and the sweep re-stamps the header from it at the next boot). Either way
  one `retained` record (`release_failed:persist_failed:<target>`) reports the
  failure in place of `released`; `release` returns whether the mode was
  released. Cleared first (the earlier order), the row was put back after a
  failed restore, and a put-back that failed too left it clear under a header
  and a mark that still said the mode: the next boot hydrated nothing, so the
  channel gate read the private session as persistent while every header-only
  reader still read it private. A header left
  STRICTER than the restore's target is another mode's commit landing, not a
  failure; a header that says nothing (deleted, damaged) claims no mode, so the
  release has nothing left to loosen there. Publishing the release with the
  header still private (the earlier best-effort restore) read as released to the
  channel gate and as private to every header-only reader. On ONE session the
  durable sequences run one at a time, under a per-session-key lock
  (**`_serialized`**, refcounted, made on first use and dropped with its last
  user) shared by `_commit_mode`'s two durable steps, `_release_mode`'s
  whole sequence and the startup sweep's per-row re-read and stamp
  (`SessionMap.stamp_privacy_headers`, which otherwise re-stamped a mode a
  release had taken back after its snapshot): two modes on one key are two groups, and two releases
  interleaved each read the other's mode as a standing claim (tracker and group
  retire only after the header write), each wrote the other mode into the
  header, both retired, and the header stayed private over a session with no
  row, mark or group left on it. Serialized, the first release restores to the
  second's claim; the second must then restore what the header held before
  EITHER, so a successful release **re-roots** the other pending groups' claims
  (`_reroot_claims`): a group whose `header_before` records the released mode
  read that mode's stamp when it reserved, not a claim of its own, and now
  records the released group's own `header_before` -- `!temporary` then
  `!incognito`, both steers declined and released in that order, otherwise left
  the header saying `temporary` for good, with nothing on the session claiming
  it. `_release_mode` reads the group's `header_before` only once it holds the
  lock, for the same reason. A cancellation during the durable steps (a
  gateway shutdown mid-release) does not abandon the sequence: the header write
  is a thread the cancellation cannot stop and the clear's flush may already be
  on its way, so both steps run as one task SHIELDED from the release's, their
  outcome is awaited, and the sequence ends released or retained before the
  cancellation propagates; only a second cancellation while that outcome is
  awaited propagates at once and leaves the outcome to the shielded task --
  whatever it lands, the row is loosened last, so a boot that reads a
  half-finished release reads the mode (the group settles failed). Loosening is
  otherwise never done, so a release checks three things first — refcounted per
  (mode, key): only the LAST pending holder releases, never when any holder
  committed (a reservation's step, or a plain modifier's message, landed under
  the mode), and never when the group did not newly apply the mode. The group
  stays registered, `releasing`, for the whole awaited clear: the mark is dropped
  last, so a same-mode request arriving in that window must not read "already
  applied" off it and run (the clear would then land under the message and lose
  the mode) -- `apply_mode`'s shortcut skips a releasing group, `_enter` waits
  for the release to settle, and the request then lands a row of its own; a
  release settles as failed for its joiners. The CONFIRMATION is not `reserve`'s to send:
  the step it protects may still decline or fail, and a "mode ON" for a message
  that then ran elsewhere or not at all is false, so `reserve` applies with
  `announce=False`, keeps the notice with the group, and it goes out once,
  through the producer the reservation was given, from whoever commits the
  group first -- `commit` (the steer landed) or a plain modifier's message
  that runs under it (`_announce_deferred`); `_notice` has exactly these two
  producers, `_commit_mode`'s last step and that one. A step that DECLINED
  (the steer answered False: the message provably runs elsewhere) releases and
  says nothing here -- the path that then runs the message announces. A step
  that RAISED, or was cancelled mid-flight, is AMBIGUOUS: a steer's bytes are
  written to the backend before the awaited flush that fails, so the message
  may already be in the turn and on its way into a transcript. Fail-closed,
  it is **`commit(reservation, unconfirmed=True)`**: the mode stands exactly
  as a landed step leaves it -- row, mark, header, the one `allowed` record --
  and the confirmation goes out with `NOTICE_UNCONFIRMED_SUFFIX` appended (the
  mode is on; the message itself may not have run; send it again if no reply
  comes). Releasing there would strip the protection from a message the
  backend may be recording, and telling the user the mode was "not applied"
  would be false for exactly that message (the Telegram steer path; both the
  raised and the cancelled arm commit with the notice best-effort -- `commit`
  records the mode before it sends, so a sender that fails changes nothing
  else and is suppressed rather than allowed to replace the step's own
  exception -- and let the failure or cancellation through). `reset()` drops
  pending groups with the trackers.
- **`strip_and_apply(text, session_key, *, source, …) -> (text, only_modifier)`**
  is the single-text entry point. `only_modifier` means the message was nothing
  but modifiers and the caller MUST return without starting a turn. Slack drives
  the primitives (`strip_token` + `apply_mode`) directly instead, because it
  carries two texts and only the mention-stripped command text decides
  `only_modifier`.
- **Everything platform-shaped is a parameter**: `source` (the audit label),
  `sessions` (supplying it is what makes the mode durable; it is used only to
  reach the one `SessionMap`), `notify` (delivers `NOTICE_TEMPORARY` /
  `NOTICE_INCOGNITO`, held here so two channels cannot describe the same mode
  differently), and `on_applied` (Slack's `set_slack_link`, so follow-ups pass
  its in-active-thread gate). The header write takes no parameter: every
  production `ConversationLog` reads the one configured sessions directory, so
  the default instance reaches the file the channel writes.
- **`strictest(modes) -> str`** collapses several requests into the one mode a
  shared turn can carry, for a channel whose queue drain answers a burst of
  messages as a single turn under a single key. Ranked on `_STRICTNESS`, which is
  declared SEPARATELY from `_MODES` — that order is about which token to strip
  first, and a third mode could need one position for parsing and another for
  strength — with a test pinning that every mode appears in both, since a mode with
  no rank would sort last and a privacy mode failing toward permissive is the wrong
  direction. Temporary outranks incognito because it forbids a superset. An
  unrecognized name is ignored rather than raised: this runs on the delivery path,
  where refusing a turn over a mode that does not exist would cost the user their
  message.

**A modifier typed MID-TURN has to travel with its message.** On the channels that
carry the queue, the command ladder strips the modifier off the text and defers the
apply until after rotation, so the mark lands on the key the turn really runs under.
The busy path returns before that point, and the drain re-enters `handle_message`
with `interpret_commands=False` on text the modifier is already gone from — so
nothing downstream can re-derive it. Telegram therefore carries the request as queue
state (`enqueue(..., privacy_request=)`, alongside `attachments`) and applies it to
the key the drained turn resolves, including on the re-enqueue that defers a burst
past `MAX_COLLAPSE`. The two mid-turn branches get different treatment because they
run under different keys: a STEERED message folds into the turn already running on
the current key, so its mark lands there immediately (and only once the steer is
known to have landed, so a refused steer that falls through to the queue does not
leave the session restricted); a QUEUED message is marked later, where its own key
is known.

**Every durable write is covered, not just the transcript.** `set_title` reaches
`ConversationLog.update_metadata`, which CREATES the session file — so a
`/title` on a restricted conversation persisted user-authored content for a mode
that had just promised not to. Telegram's `_handle_title` now gates on
`is_restricted` and says so in its reply, matching `_persist_turn` and Slack's own
`/title`. The predicate is the channel's in-process tracker and NOT the transcript's
`memory_mode` header alone. Both dashboard and channel Incognito/Temporary
sessions suppress Crew transcript/body persistence; the canonical execution
carrier supplies privacy to child work before dispatch. `test_telegram_parity.py`
enumerates the title writes in every dispatcher that reaches `privacy_mode` and
requires each to consult the predicate — scoped that way because the eight channels
that do not offer the modes have no session that can BE restricted.

**Enforcing temporary takes TWO gates, and they are not the same predicate.** The
write half is `is_restricted` (`_is_slack_restricted` on Slack), consulted at every
transcript, memory and artifact write. The read half is one kwarg —
`ContextBuilder.build_message(..., blocks_reads=)`, which suppresses the memory and
lesson blocks — and it defaults False, so a channel that omits it injects yesterday's
memories into the prompt of a thread `NOTICE_TEMPORARY` told the user reads nothing.
Every dispatch path passes it: Slack's native `handle_message`, Slack's default
`transport_dispatch`, and Telegram's. The predicate there is **`is_temporary`, never
`is_restricted`** — incognito is documented as reading memory and refusing only to
write, so the combined predicate would take memory away from a mode meant to keep
it, and it would do so silently.

The dashboard's `_is_restricted_session` / `_blocks_reads_session`
(`dashboard/handlers/_shared.py`) reach this through `is_channel_session_key(sk)`,
not `sk.startswith("slack:")`. The narrow test made that branch structurally
unreachable for every other channel, so a Telegram session the user marked
incognito could never enter it and the ~30 dashboard mutations gated on the
predicate stayed open for it.

## Auto-titling (`auto_title.py`)

After the first successful turn a channel conversation is named only if the user
typed a name; otherwise every surface shows a deterministic fallback. One short
background turn asks the model for a name instead. This was Slack-only AND dead on
Slack's own default path: `_maybe_auto_title_slack` was called from the native
loop and nowhere else, while `messaging.use_transport` defaults `True` — so on a
default install no Slack session was ever LLM-titled.

- **`maybe_auto_title(sessions, conv_log, session_key, user_text, assistant_text,
  *, pin, source, resources="", set_channel_title=None) -> str`** returns the
  applied title, or `""` when nothing was applied. `set_channel_title` is the
  optional caller-side callback that renames the conversation on the platform
  (Slack's `set_thread_title`), which is what keeps `messaging` free of any
  channel import; a channel with no renameable conversation omits it and still
  gets the transcript title. `conv_log` may be `None`.
- **`pin` is REQUIRED and comes from the CALLER**, which takes it with
  `pin_record(conv_log, session_key)` before the naming task is fired and, when the
  caller holds a per-session permit, before that permit is RELEASED. It is a `RecordPin(state, identity)`: the record's existence —
  `RECORD_PRESENT`, `RECORD_ABSENT` or `RECORD_UNKNOWN`, read through
  `get_metadata_status` so an unreadable record is not mistaken for a deleted one
  — paired with the record's creation stamp, because a state alone cannot tell
  the record apart from a replacement. A channel
  session key is derived from the THREAD rather than from the record, so a
  deletion plus a re-message landing in either window below mints a NEW record
  under the SAME key, pins the replacement, and writes the deleted conversation's
  title onto it. There is deliberately no default, so a call site added later cannot
  inherit that window silently. A `conv_log` of `None` has no record to pin and
  pins UNKNOWN. The persisted guard `_untitled_and_still_ours` re-checks both
  halves inside the write's own lock, where ABSENT and UNKNOWN both refuse.
- **Two windows, not one.** Reading the pin inside the scheduled task leaves one
  event-loop tick between the claim and the pin. Reading it after the permit is
  released leaves a much wider one: a queued turn takes that permit and can delete
  and re-mint the record while the released turn is still finishing its channel
  I/O. Holding the permit is what makes the read exclusive; adjacency to
  `try_claim` alone does not.
- **An ABSENT permit-held pin is re-read once the turn's own row has landed.**
  Slack's native path holds the permit until before it writes this turn's
  transcript row, so a key whose record does not exist yet reads ABSENT under the
  permit. An absent record has no replacement it could be confused with, so that
  one state is re-pinned at the scheduling site, which is what keeps a brand-new
  conversation nameable from its first exchange. PRESENT is never re-read: that is
  the identity a replacement would overwrite.
- **The claim is shared, and it is check-and-mark in ONE synchronous step.**
  `try_claim(session_key)` is called by the caller *before* it fires the task, so
  two turns racing — including two turns on two different channels that resolved
  to the same session key — produce exactly one naming turn. A message arriving
  inside that window is intentionally skipped rather than double-titling.
  `TITLE_LRU_MAX` (10,000) bounds the tracker.
- **Whether the claim is released turns on WHOSE record the key still names, not
  on whether the turn succeeded.** The claim lives in a process-wide LRU, so one
  held on a key whose record is gone silences auto-titling for whatever takes
  that key next for as long as the process runs, while one released on a record
  somebody has already named bills a second naming turn on it. `release_claim`
  therefore runs when the pin is ABSENT — decided before the model turn, since a
  record that was not there to pin cannot be written whatever the turn produces —
  when the title comes back empty (a SKIP verdict), on a timeout or any other
  exception, and when the durable write is refused AND
  `_key_no_longer_names_our_record` reads the key as gone or replaced. The claim
  is KEPT when a title landed, when a manual rename won while the turn streamed,
  when the refusal was the record already carrying a name, and whenever the state
  is UNKNOWN — pinned, or on that recheck — because a record that merely could
  not be read would otherwise bill a fresh naming turn on every following
  exchange for as long as it stays damaged.
- **A person's name always wins, and it takes TWO guards** because they cover
  different windows. The in-process one (`TITLE_KIND_MANUAL` recorded on the claim)
  catches a rename that lands while the naming turn streams. The persisted one is
  `ConversationLog.update_metadata_if` with a "the record still carries no title"
  guard, evaluated under the cross-process lock: after a restart the claim tracker
  is empty and the claim is taken again, so without it a manual rename made in an
  earlier process is silently replaced. When that guard refuses, the channel title
  is left alone too — otherwise the two surfaces would disagree about what the
  conversation is.
- **The turn is tool-free and bounded.** Every `EVENT_PERMISSION_REQUEST` is
  rejected and audited (`auto_title.tool_rejected`): the prompt is built from text
  the model itself produced, so a tool call there is prompt-injection reach, and an
  unanswered request wedges the agent process. One turn,
  `TITLE_TURN_TIMEOUT_SECS` (30s), `TITLE_INPUT_CHARS` (200) per side, capped at
  `TITLE_MAX_CHARS` (80) after credential/exfiltration redaction. `get_lock()`
  serializes the shared background session and rebinds per event loop.
- **No model id, anywhere.** The turn runs through `llm_helpers.background_turn`,
  so the model is whatever the shared background session was created with
  (`agent.role_models.background`, default `"auto"`). Spend is labelled
  `bg:{source}_auto_title` so it is attributable per channel.
- `clean_title` keeps the first line, trims quoting, and drops `<`/`>` — they open
  a link in Slack's mrkdwn and a tag in Telegram's HTML, and a title is rendered
  as-is on both. It then runs the two checks every label path shares from
  `kiro_crew.label_guard`: the taught `SKIP` verdict means "no title" alone or
  with a reason attached (`is_verdict_reply`: `SKIP - too vague`), and a reply
  shaped like a sentence about the task (`looks_like_prose`: a refusal opener,
  a terminator mid-line, more words than a name carries) is discarded the same
  way. The disposition is the one the dashboard title uses — no title, keep
  the fallback, never store the refusal — and it matters most here because a
  `set_channel_title` hook writes this name to the Slack thread itself.

## Slack reference implementation

### `SlackTransport` (`slack/transport.py`)

Wraps `SlackClientOps` in the Layer-1 contract; declares Slack's real (rich-end) capabilities: `streaming/edit/reactions/files/rich_blocks/threads=True`, `max_message_chars=3900` (`SLACK_MSG_LIMIT`, the shipped send path's split point), `max_buttons=10` (the checkboxes-element options cap). `authorize()` is **deny-by-default & owner-only** — an empty `allowed_users` frozenset (copied at construction so it can't mutate mid-decision) authorizes nobody, and every denial (including empty/missing `user_id`) is SEL-audited (`operation="slack_transport.authorize"`, `outcome="denied"`). `receive()` acks → runs the trusted-bot gate → normalizes to `InboundMessage` → authorizes → invokes the injected `dispatch` callback. Bot-authored events are admitted ONLY on a positive `bot_id` match against the `trusted_bot_ids` allow-list (a constructor param mirroring `allowed_users`, frozen at construction, empty by default so every bot event drops); the gate calls the ONE owner of the rule, `slack.enterprise.trusted_bot_admission`, which the Socket Mode drop site in `slack/events.py` calls too — what each site still owns is the READ TIMING of the allow-list it passes in (this transport freezes a constructor snapshot to match `allowed_users`; the event gate passes the live config) — the gateway's own bot id is never trusted even when listed (`error=own_bot_id_never_trusted`), an unverified self identity fails closed (`error=trusted_bot_requires_verified_self_id`), untrusted-bot denials are SEL-audited (`operation="slack_transport.receive"`, `error=untrusted_bot`) with the trust decision running before the `subtype == "bot_message"` filter so a trusted bot's `bot_message` is not eaten, and an admitted bot's `bot_id` stands in as `user_id` with the admission audited (`outcome="allowed"`, `resources="trusted_bot"`). Loop bounding (the per-thread trusted-bot turn cap) stays the dispatch layer's job. The client is held **and exposed** via a `client` property (guardrail G2).

### `SlackRenderer` + `SlackApprovalDecider` (`slack/renderer.py`)

`SlackRenderer` maps the abstract `OutputEvent` stream onto Slack's streaming + Block Kit surface, reusing the native streaming machinery verbatim (bracket-hold `[OPTIONS:…]` filter, `_EDIT_INTERVAL` edit-throttle, `chat.update` cursor fallback when no streaming surface, `StatusReactionController` phase/emoji, per-tool task cards with a 30s elapsed timer, a timing footer at `on_done`). `on_turn_start` is idempotent (guarded by `_started`) so the dispatcher can fire the ack reaction early and the driver's later call no-ops.

`on_prompt_choice` renders `build_approval_blocks()` — three Block Kit buttons whose `action_id`s encode the request id:

| Button | `action_id` prefix | Scope |
|--------|--------------------|-------|
| Approve | `mc_tool_approve_` | this tool |
| Trust session | `mc_tool_trust_` | per-session auto-approve (not global YOLO) |
| Deny | `mc_tool_deny_` | this tool |

`SlackApprovalDecider` is the `TurnDriver` `decider`. The decision window opens where the prompt is rendered, not where the wait starts: `SlackRenderer.on_prompt_choice` calls `reserve(request_id)` before `post_blocks`, which creates the per-request future, registers the decider in a process-global `_REGISTRY` keyed `session_key:request_id`, mints this prompt's nonce into `_NONCES` under the same key, and RETURNS that nonce for the buttons to carry; `__call__` adopts that reservation, awaits it with `asyncio.wait_for(..., timeout=_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT)`, and **denies by default** on timeout. `TurnDriver` dispatches `PROMPT_CHOICE` and only then awaits the decider, so a click landing between the blocks going out and the wait starting resolves the reservation and `__call__` returns that decision without waiting; minting the future in `__call__` instead discards such a click, reports it as an approval that already expired, and denies when the window elapses. `reserve` never replaces a live future (a second reserve, or one after the wait, keeps the object the waiter holds) but always re-mints the nonce, so only the buttons now on screen can decide; it is inert off the event loop, where no waiter can exist, and returns no nonce there. A window no wait adopted is closed by `discard(request_id)` when the post raises and by the classmethod `discard_session(session_key)` in the dispatch's per-turn `finally`, each retiring the nonce with the window, so a click cannot later resolve a future nobody reads; both drop every reservation no WAIT owns (`_AWAITED`), whatever state its future is in, because a decision no wait adopted has no reader and retaining it leaves a live nonce behind buttons that stay in the thread. The Slack interaction handler (`slack/interactions.py`) — which has no direct reference to the per-turn decider — splits a press's token with `split_approval_token` and resolves clicks via the classmethods `resolve_global(registry_key, approved, nonce=)` and `session_for(registry_key, nonce=)`, both of which refuse a press whose nonce is not the live one; `session_for` additionally requires the prompt's future to exist and still be PENDING, since the nonce is retired by the wait's `finally` rather than by the decision, so between a Deny landing and that wait resuming the nonce still matches a prompt nothing can answer. A Trust click calls `add_trusted_session()` before resolving so subsequent tools in the session are auto-approved (via the driver's `auto_approve_session` predicate), and is therefore gated on the same nonce and skipped entirely when the lookup yields no session — without the pending requirement it would escalate the session for every later tool while the handler reported the press as expired. The token travels in each button's `value` as `session_key:request_id|nonce` and NOT in its `action_id`, whose valueless fallback splits on `_` — a character the nonce alphabet contains.

### `handle_message_transport` (`slack/transport_dispatch.py`)

Full new-path dispatch: fires the ack reaction + working status immediately (constructing the `SlackRenderer` before the potentially slow session acquisition), acquires/creates the session, builds the message with context, then drives `TurnDriver.run()`. Agent resolution: thread override (`!agent`) → per-channel `agent_override` → configured default → the canonical `_DEFAULT_KIROCREW_AGENT = "kirocrew"` fallback (so the session loads kirocrew-core / `spawn_run` rather than kiro-cli's bare built-in default). It injects `auto_approve_tool=lambda title: _should_auto_approve_spawn(context_builder, title)` and `auto_approve_session=lambda: is_slack_session_trusted(session_key)`. Post-turn bookkeeping (context-usage accounting, conversation logging, the fire-and-forget [auto-title](#auto-titling-auto_titlepy), success SEL audit) is each isolated in its own `try/except` so a bookkeeping failure never re-records a successful turn as a failure; `sessions.release()` runs in `finally`. The auto-title requires a non-empty reply and an unrestricted session, and claims through the shared tracker so the native path cannot title the same conversation twice.

**Partial-progress rescue on the failure path.** A turn killed mid-flight (transient backend fault, dropped stream) used to discard everything the model had already produced, so a retry re-read a transcript ending at the question and started over — observed as five consecutive attempts on one thread with the session file still 625 bytes at the end. The `except` branch now persists what the user was already shown, suffixed with `PARTIAL_TURN_MARKER` (defined in `slack/renderer.py`) so the next turn can tell a reply that stopped mid-sentence from a finished one and does not treat the work as already reported.

What it persists is `SlackRenderer.delivered_text`, a **delivery ledger** — not the model's output. The distinction is the whole point: `_accumulated` grows the moment a chunk arrives, but a chunk only reaches Slack when the `_EDIT_INTERVAL` throttle opens, so persisting that would record text nobody saw as established fact and the retry would build on something that was never on screen. Only `_append_stream` advances the ledger, and only when Slack acknowledged the append. Two cases deliberately do **not** advance it:

- **The `chat.update` cursor fallback** (no streaming surface). `_safe_update` returns `None`, swallows its own exceptions and truncates at `SLACK_MSG_LIMIT`, and the frame it sends is a fence-safe prefix rather than the whole text — so delivery is unconfirmable there. The ledger stays empty and the rescue no-ops, which is the correct outcome.
- **A rejected append**, including after the one stream rotation retry. A send Slack refused is not delivery.

The ledger holds text as SHOWN — thinking tags stripped, `[OPTIONS:…]` markup suppressed by the bracket-hold, image-adjacent text still withheld by `_ref_hold` until the seal releases it. It is always a subset of `_accumulated`, never a superset. Appends are cumulative and final on this path (`chat.stopStream` does not replace them), so the ledger needs no reconciliation when `_accumulated` is reset at a `wait` boundary.

Guards, so the rescue can never make a failure worse: skipped when the reply already landed (`_stamped_turn`); skipped when the turn already ended normally (`SlackRenderer.turn_finalized`), because a fault raised after a finished stream unwinds through the same `except` and marking that complete reply as cut off would tell the next turn to resume finished work; the rescued row carries `source_user` so it keeps the same Slack-user provenance as every success-path write; skipped for Slack-restricted (incognito/temporary) sessions, matching the existing write points; `strip()` decides emptiness only, and the ledger text is persisted verbatim because leading indentation is content in a transcript; run off-loop via `asyncio.to_thread` because `ConversationLog.append` takes a cross-process flock; wrapped in its own `try/except` so a disk fault cannot replace the real exception in the log.

The rescue also runs **only when the user row is confirmed on disk** (`_logged_user_turn`). When the receipt append raised, whether the row landed is unknowable from the dispatcher: `ConversationLog.append` writes the row and only then invalidates caches and calls `_maybe_rotate`, whose own guard covers just the `stat` — so a rotation fault on an oversized transcript raises with the row already durable, while a lock timeout raises with nothing written. Writing both rows there would duplicate the question; writing the assistant row alone would orphan the answer. So the rescue no-ops and that retry starts from the question, exactly as it did before this change — the same rule the ledger applies to an unacknowledged send: when an outcome is unconfirmable, record nothing.

This is why the rescue never writes the user row itself. The receipt append always precedes streaming, so any turn with text worth rescuing has already attempted it, leaving only "confirmed written" and "unknowable" — there is no reachable state in which the rescue both has text and must recover the question.

**This is the only rescue in the codebase, and that is deliberate — because Slack is the only renderer that can say WHICH bytes the user retained, not because it is the only one that emits mid-turn.** Several renderers the shared `drive_turn` pipeline serves do send during a turn: `telegram/renderer.py` live-edits the current segment per chunk (`_stream_live`), `wecom/renderer.py` pushes stream frames from `on_text_chunk` (`_push`), and `webex/renderer.py` rides the buffer tail on a status frame. None of them yields a per-append record of acknowledged output — those frames are throttled, replaced wholesale, or truncated — so on those channels there is no honest ledger to rescue from, and persisting produced-but-undelivered text would record an undelivered reply as a completed turn, which `weixin/turn_renderer._send` documents and `test_weixin_dispatch.py::test_delivery_failure_is_not_recorded_as_success` guards. `capabilities.streaming`/`edit` cannot be used to tell the cases apart either, because `transport.py` marks both aspirational and explicitly unenforced.

### Two Slack features are deliberately NOT the reference

Slack is the reference for the LAYERS — transport contract, renderer, turn
dispatch — not for its feature list. Two of its features are decisions against
replication rather than parity gaps, so an audit that finds another channel
lacking them should close the finding, not file it:

- **A channel-local auto-approve switch** (`is_slack_session_trusted`, the
  `mc_tool_trust_` button). Approval posture is a property of the agent, not of
  the surface a message arrived on: a second place to turn approvals off is a
  second place to forget one is off, and it makes a session's ceiling depend on
  which app the user typed into. Every other channel routes `/yolo` through the
  one `safety_override` grant — see "There is ONE auto-approve grant" under
  [Invariants](#invariants).
- **A channel-local reply redirect.** Reply routing is owned by the session's
  origin binding that every channel already shares through `drive_turn`. A
  second router for the same question disagrees with the first the moment either
  changes, and the disagreement surfaces as a reply delivered to the wrong
  conversation.

## Cron output delivery: one run, one surface

An unattended cron run has no inbound message to answer, so its output is
delivered proactively, and the Slack gateway chooses ONE surface instead of
broadcasting to every one it can reach. The cron callback, `_deliver_cron_response`,
`_deliver_channel_reply` and the failure alerts in `slack/gateway.py` choose and
redact each leg; the origin and channel-conversation helpers they call are
`slack/gateway_runtime/delivery.py`. The choice is that a job belongs to the
conversation that scheduled it: `job.session_key` records the creating session's
key, and `_cron_origin_key(parent_key)` recovers it from the run's
`cron:{job_id}` / `cron:{job_id}:{run_id}` key, which carries no channel namespace
of its own and so can never name the surface itself.

- **An explicit `job.channel` still wins, on all three legs.** A pin means the
  user named where they want to be told, so the channel leg is SKIPPED for a
  pinned job and Slack delivers to the pin. This has to hold on the result leg,
  the run-failure alert and the crash alert alike: because the Slack leg stands
  down on a confirmed channel delivery, a channel leg that ignores the pin does
  not merely add a surface, it REPLACES the pinned one — the alert lands on the
  origin conversation and never where the user asked.
- **Otherwise a DELIVERED channel send takes it and the Slack owner-DM leg stands
  down.** Every leg gates on the boolean `_deliver_cron_to_channel` actually
  returned, never on a prediction that the channel *would* take it: governance can
  refuse the send and the wire can fail, and standing Slack down on a prediction
  loses the run's output outright in exactly the cases the fallback exists for.
  That send redacts at the canonical egress (credentials and exfiltration URLs
  both) and chunks to the transport's own ceiling. Delivering to both would notify
  one operator twice for one run, which is how notifications become noise people
  stop reading.
- **A markup cut is an egress, and appended text is final.** Slack streams by
  appending, so two appends render as one run of characters. The image-withhold
  path therefore holds a `_REF_HOLD_LOOKBEHIND_CHARS` margin BEFORE the span as
  well as the span itself, and `_release_refs` redacts the string it returns.
  Both halves are required: cutting exactly at the span start puts a straddling
  credential's two halves in separate appends, each individually clean while the
  rendered concatenation spells the key, and the driver's rolling redactor cannot
  see it either because the hold reordered the text out of its window. Redacting
  inside `_release_refs` rather than at the append site keeps the guarantee with
  the join that creates the hazard.
- **The display-form floor lives at the SINK, in both renderers.** Slack's
  `_display_safe` is the twin of Discord's `_redact_transformed`, and every
  model-authored egress in the file passes it: the sealed body, an appended stream
  chunk (final on that path, so an unscanned append is unrecoverable), the posted
  thinking block, an upload-rejection note (whose destination came from the model,
  inside italics Slack renders away), and the released image-markup tail. The gap
  was found three times on three different lines before it was moved to the sink,
  which is the argument for the sink: a per-line scan checks one of the two forms
  that leave, and the reviewer has to find each line. It is idempotent, so a path
  that meets it twice costs nothing.
- **Every sink reports to `delivery_failed`.** The property answers "the user saw
  NOTHING", so it counts an attempt and a landing at each place output leaves the
  renderer: the segment seal, the markup recovery after a failed upload (LANDED
  only -- the seal that fell through already counted the attempt, and counting a
  second would make a recovered turn look like two failures), and the placeholder
  for an empty-bodied turn (which, with no earlier seal, is the whole delivery). A
  sink that delivers without reporting turns a success into a duplicate cron
  alert; one that fails without reporting files a silent turn as a success.
- **Every proactive egress meets the display-form floor, not just the literal
  one.** A renderer is where a TURN gets that floor, and no proactive path passes
  one, so the floor sits at each of the three chokepoints instead:
  `api_send_message` (before any leg reads the body), `_deliver_channel_reply`
  (cron results, run-failure and crash alerts, subagent completions), and
  `_deliver_channel_dm` (so a future caller cannot reach a channel without it).
  A literal-only scan there let a markdown-collapse credential (`AKIA**...**`,
  which the client renders whole) reach the channel, and every caller inherited
  the gap rather than each one carrying it. Applying it twice on one path is
  deliberate: the redactors are idempotent and the guarantee belongs at the
  egress, not at whichever caller exists today.
- **The SEL trail names the surfaces the alert LEFT ON.** `downstream_service`
  lists `slack` only when the Slack post itself landed, and the channel namespace
  only when the channel send returned True. A configured client is not a delivery:
  reading `self.slack` there recorded a Slack egress for every Discord-only alert,
  which corrupts the one question the record answers — where did this content go —
  in the direction that overstates exposure.
- **Slack remains the delivery for a Slack-origin, dashboard-origin or
  origin-less job**, which is every job an install carries today, so nothing that
  works now changes: `_deliver_cron_to_channel` returns False for those and the
  Slack leg runs as before, opening the owner's DM when the job stores no channel.
  The dashboard notification is resolved ahead of this choice and is unaffected by
  it.

Three legs carry the rule: the run's result, the post-subagent response
(`_deliver_cron_response`, which tries the channel FIRST so a Slack-less install
still delivers, and skips Slack once it has), and the run-failure alert (gated on
the channel leg's confirmed delivery). The crash-alert path, where the run raised
rather than returning a failure, is the exception and still sends both legs,
gated only on `job.silent`. Dedup state (`last_posted_hash`,
`last_failure_hash`) advances once EITHER leg delivered, because a Slack-less
install would otherwise never advance it and would re-deliver an unchanged result
on every run.

**Both ends of a cron send are governed, tightest-wins.**
`_deliver_channel_reply` vets the DESTINATION conversation (`origin_key`), so
`_deliver_cron_to_channel` vets the ACTOR as well: `actor_key` is the
`cron:{job_id}` surface, and cron is the unattended surface an operator restricts
hardest, so evaluating only the destination would let a cron-surface `channels`
denial stop applying the moment cron routed through a channel it does not itself
own. Both go through the same audited, fail-closed `channels` ladder, off-loop
because resolving the active profile walks the profile directory. An unusable
answer is not permission: a raised evaluation and a `Decision` without
`permitted` both refuse the send.

## Invariants

- **One-way dependency**: `kiro_crew.messaging` never imports `kiro_crew.slack` / `kiro_crew.dashboard`; violations reintroduce the cycle the abstraction removed. This holds at **any nesting depth** — a deferred in-function import is still an edge, so a shared helper that needs something from a surface takes it as a parameter (`parse_dashboard_ttl`'s `parse_duration`). `test_messaging_commands.py::TestLayering` scans the package's ASTs for it. There is exactly ONE recorded exception, and it is recorded as a `(file, module)` pair with a reason rather than as a hole in the scan: `dispatch.py`'s `build_directive_consumer` reaches `dashboard.session_directive_apply`, the SHARED applier the dashboard's own consumer uses, so the dashboard-only denial and the monitor-trio authorization chokepoint live in one place. Injecting that applier as a parameter — the pattern the TTL helper uses — would put a security boundary behind a caller-supplied callable, which is the worse trade. A companion test deletes the entry the moment the edge goes away, so the list cannot rot into a standing pre-authorization.
- **A hoisted command carries its AUDIT with it.** `cron_command_reply` emits the
  `cron.remove` and `cron.batch_delete` SEL events that used to live in Slack's own
  copy of the command, so hoisting neither dropped Slack's trail nor left the other
  channels deleting cron jobs without one. `source` and `caller` are keyword-only
  with empty defaults: a channel that has no user id in hand still leaves a record
  with the surface as the subject, because once the jobs are gone from `crons.json`
  the trail is the only way to tell a deliberate remove-all from data loss. A
  contended store is audited as nothing, since the delete never happened.
- **A shared command handler returns reply TEXT, never sends, and takes no address**: the send is the only per-channel half, so `run_yolo_command`, `rebind_conversation_location` and `release_conversation_location` all hand back a string. `stop_running_turn` is the single exception: it still returns the text, but it owns the send through an injected `deliver` callable, because the compaction decline arms an escalation that must not outlive an undelivered warning, and only the function that awaited the send knows whether it landed. A callable is not an address: `deliver` closes over the channel's own target, so nothing shared accepts a `chat_id` / `channel_id` / `conversation_id` / thread, and a receipt bubble is reached only through the already-bound `ReceiptSurface`. Accepting one address would put the first per-channel branch inside the shared module and put Telegram's forum routing and Teams' service URLs back in scope for it.
- **Deny-by-default authorization**: `MessagingTransport.authorize` implementations authorize nobody when unconfigured; interactive approval denies unless positively approved (or a timeout elapses → deny).
- **Redaction is unconditional**: all LLM/tool-originated text flowing through `TurnDriver` passes `redact_exfiltration_urls()` + `redact_credentials()` before reaching any renderer.
- **Protocol metadata is not assistant speech**: streamed steering frames are withheld until complete, removed even when split across chunks, and represented as a structured boundary. Summary-bearing compaction activity is never sent to a channel as assistant speech; only a terse receipt may be rendered. `[OPTIONS: …]` remains user-facing and is never stripped by the shared filter.
- **Conservative capability defaults**: unspecified `TransportCapabilities` degrade safely (WhatsApp-like floor), and renderers must honor `max_message_chars` (`chunk_text`) and `max_buttons`.
- **Table rendering is per-target and outbound-only**: `messaging/tables.py` runs on the bytes a renderer is about to send, never on the canonical text `TurnDriver.run` returns or on the `text()` accessors that feed history — so the dashboard keeps the authored pipes while a pipes-only channel gets cards. A target may only set `table_mode=native` when its `TransportCapabilities.native_tables` is true; setting it without the capability resolves to `cards`, because raw pipes are the one output the conversion exists to prevent.
- **A channel's keyword commands are one copy of their reply text**: `spawn`,
  `cron`, `task run` and the stats line live in `messaging/commands.py`, and Slack
  delegates to them rather than holding the originals. A channel adds its own
  grammar (`/cron` vs the bare `cron` keyword) and nothing else, so the two
  channels cannot answer the same question differently. Where a command starts
  something that later needs to reach the operator back, the conversation travels
  with it: both `task_command_reply` (the bare `task run <spec>` keyword) and
  `task_arg_reply` (the already-parsed `/task run <spec>` form) take a
  keyword-only `session_key=""` and forward it to `runner.start_background`, so
  the same run escalates its approval notices to the same place whichever grammar
  typed it. A caller that omits it keeps the narrow `(path, source=)` call, which
  is what a duck-typed stand-in still accepts.
- **A task spec path is validated before it is read, on the channel path too**: a
  spec's CONTENTS reach the model, so an arbitrary path is an exfiltration
  primitive rather than a usability question (`task run ~/.ssh/id_rsa`). Both
  grammars route through `hooks.validate_file_path`, which applies the Windows UNC
  trusted-root check before resolving (a `realpath` on a UNC path is itself the
  outbound SMB probe) to the raw and anchored forms, screens every Windows
  link's own target -- a linked ancestor as well as a leaf link -- with
  `readlink` (a local metadata read, never a traversal): a link aimed at an
  untrusted UNC share, a device namespace, a drive-relative target or a
  `..`-climbing suffix is refused before `realpath` can probe it, while a
  link whose target is another local directory is rewritten to that target
  so benign junctions still resolve; canonicalizes through every symlink on
  POSIX, and refuses a resolved
  target under a sensitive root, so an innocent-looking path that resolves into a
  blocked root is refused through the link. The **canonical** path is what reaches
  `runner.start_background`, not the raw argument, because validating one string and
  acting on another is how a guard becomes ornamental. The refusal names neither the
  path nor the reason, since distinguishing "sensitive" from "missing" is an oracle
  for probing which roots exist on the host. This matches what the dashboard's
  `POST /api/taskrunner` (`api_taskrunner_start`) already did; the channel keyword was the surface missing
  it.
- **A session-scoped gate is keyed by SESSION KEY, and its predicate never tests a
  namespace**: `privacy_mode.is_restricted` is a dict lookup, so a Slack, Telegram
  or Discord key all answer the same way. A caller narrowing to
  `startswith("slack:")` does not fail loudly — it makes the branch structurally
  unreachable for every other channel, which is how the dashboard's restricted-session
  mutations stayed open for a non-Slack incognito session. Use
  `link.is_channel_session_key` when the question really is "is this a channel
  session at all".
- **A conversation is titled at most once, through ONE claim tracker**:
  `auto_title.try_claim` is check-and-mark in a single synchronous step, and the
  tracker lives in `messaging/auto_title.py` rather than per channel, so two turns
  that resolved to the same session key cannot both spend a naming turn on it. A
  generated title never replaces a name a person chose: the in-process
  `TITLE_KIND_MANUAL` claim covers a rename mid-stream, and
  `update_metadata_if`'s "no title on the record" guard — re-decided under the
  cross-process lock — covers a rename made before a restart, when the tracker is
  empty and the claim is taken again.
- **Redaction is applied against the form a channel RENDERS, not only the bytes it
  sends**: any renderer that converts markdown to a markup the platform then hides
  must run `display_safety.redact_for_display` at its own seal, because the
  byte-level pass in `TurnDriver` ran before those tags existed. Slack, Discord and
  Telegram each do this at their render boundary.
- **A media-only inbound message is a message**: a transport whose text extraction comes back empty may only drop the envelope when there are also no media items. Weixin previously returned early on empty text, so an uncaptioned screenshot was discarded with no reply and no log line — the sender saw a successful send while the agent was never told anything arrived. Emptiness is a reason to drop only when the whole envelope is empty.
- **Unknown formats remain passive and complete**: `messaging/attachments.py` preserves video and unrecognized formats as byte-identical, randomized temporary files, supplies their local paths and original metadata to the agent, and transfers cleanup ownership through the current or queued turn. Opaque bytes are never automatically parsed, extracted, or executed; an inlineable image suffix is stripped from the temporary path so the suffix-typed ACP image sink cannot claim them, and any later tool access still crosses the normal permission and hook boundaries.
- **Weixin inbound media is CDN-indirect**: iLink envelopes never carry bytes, only a `CDNMedia` reference (`encrypt_query_param` + `aes_key`) whose object is AES-128-ECB encrypted on the WeChat CDN. `weixin/media.py` owns that protocol work (URL construction with percent-encoded params, key decoding, decrypt, a streaming size cap enforced on bytes read rather than `Content-Length`); `weixin/attachments.py` maps the four CDN-backed item types onto the shared `Attachment` and hands them to `messaging/attachments.py`, which keeps classification, limits, signature validation and temp-file ownership channel-neutral. The `aes_key` field carries **two** encodings for the same value — `base64(raw 16 bytes)` for images, `base64(ascii hex)` for file/voice/video — discriminated by decoded length plus a strict hex check, because guessing wrong yields plausible garbage rather than an error. A voice item that already carries server-side `text` short-circuits the download: iLink voice is SILK, which no shipped transcription backend decodes, so the local path is strictly worse than the transcript the server gave us. `files_inbound=True` reflects this; `files_outbound` stays `False` until the `getuploadurl` + encrypted CDN PUT half lands.
- **A mid-turn queue receipt is edited, never deleted**: it flips in place to `▶️ Now answering` on drain and to `🛑 Cancelled` on `/stop`. It is the durable record that a held message was accepted, so no path may delete it. A caller-scoped `/stop` withdraws that caller's OWN lines from the record, drops the registry entry, and writes `🛑 Cancelled` over those lines only when the caller is the principal who OPENED the bubble -- otherwise `msg_id` names a message in somebody else's conversation. The entry may not survive: a drain flips using the chat of the entry it answers, so a surviving entry whose opener has stopped would hand it an id minted in another chat and overwrite an unrelated message there. Both terminal transitions are preceded by the same condition, which is about neither addressing nor who is calling: while ANOTHER principal's line is still listed at the bubble's own address, nothing terminal is written and the entry stays LIVE -- the stop writes nothing at all, and the drain re-renders `⏳ Queued` over what remains -- because that entry is the only handle those still-queued messages have.
- **A queued burst drains as ONE turn, under ONE envelope taken from the messages**: `_drain_queue` joins the held texts in arrival order into a single combined turn (capped by `_MAX_COLLAPSE` and, on Discord, the attachment ingest limit), never N replayed turns. Anything past a cap is re-enqueued together with everything behind it so FIFO order stays exact. Because `dm_scope = "unified"` can fold several people onto one queue, every queue-carrying channel records a per-entry origin, collapses only entries sharing a sender and a place, and replays from the first entry's origin -- grouping on sender and place, never on a per-message id, which would stop the collapse altogether. Beside that origin every entry also records a neutral `queued_owner`, read off the same sender key, which is what lets `/stop` drop one person's queued messages and leave everybody else's. A deferred entry is re-enqueued WITH its origin, or it would inherit the next first entry's identity one iteration later. An entry recorded by ANOTHER transport sharing that queue is set aside and its owner's drain is woken (`messaging/queue_drain.py`), because setting aside an already-receipted message without waking anyone leaves it unanswered until that transport next speaks.
- **A mid-turn steer requires a genuinely live turn**: gate on `provider.has_active_turn()`, never on `sessions.is_busy()` alone, which stays true through post-turn bookkeeping. Steering an ended prompt is silently swallowed, producing an acknowledgement with no answer.
- **Cancel is cooperative before it is fatal**: `/stop` sends the ACP `session/cancel` notification and lets the turn stop at its next safe point; escalation to a hard kill happens only after the soft-stop budget elapses without an ack. On a shared runtime the cooperative path is the only one that cannot take a co-tenant down with it.
- **Transport shutdown is quiescent**: a client that fast-acks inbound work in background tasks cancels and awaits those tasks before closing their shared network session or returning from shutdown. Teams owns this ordering in `TeamsClient.close()`, so a gateway teardown cannot leave a turn unwinding against an already-closed Connector session; `WeComClient.close()` owns the same one for its turn tasks, which borrow the client's `aiohttp` session for the `response_url` fallback.
- **An at-least-once inbound callback is deduped before it drives a turn**: a protocol that documents redelivery (WeCom's `msgid`) needs a bounded suppression window, because a repeat costs a second provider round-trip and repeats every tool side effect. The window is consulted AFTER authorization so unauthorized traffic cannot evict genuine entries, and a frame with no id is never suppressed — no id is no evidence of a duplicate, and dropping it would lose a real message.
- **A dropped outbound send is loud, never a return value**: `TeamsClient._post_activity` raises `TeamsSendError`. Every caller treats a return as proof of delivery — the renderer records the answer as sent, a proactive leg reports it delivered — so swallowing the failure is what makes the gateway claim a message the user never saw. Callers that genuinely tolerate failure (typing, an in-place edit, a command acknowledgement) catch it explicitly at their own call site, which is where the tolerance is a decision rather than a default.
- **A self-authenticating external webhook is exempt from CSRF, method-scoped, and from nothing else**: the Bot Framework Connector sends no `Origin` and no `Referer`, and `check_origin` has no configuration that admits a no-Origin non-loopback POST, so without the exemption the route 403s before its own JWT gate can run. The exemption covers `POST` only, leaves `host_validation_middleware` untouched, and is sound precisely because the handler ignores cookies — the threat CSRF addresses does not exist on it. **The set holds exactly one path.** `/api/hooks/agent` shares the shape and has the separate token-auth bypass, but is NOT Origin-exempt: skipping the cookie gate and skipping the Origin check are two different grants, no reported failure named the second for that route, and a perimeter exemption is far harder to withdraw once a caller depends on it than to add later with its own cause. Adding a path to that set is a security review, not a copied line.
- **Inbound token validation is never reordered behind body USE**: `on_activity` verifies the bearer token before the activity is acted on, and the replay-dedupe check runs AFTER the `serviceUrl` attestation so an unattested activity cannot consume a dedupe slot. The body IS read and JSON-parsed first, under a byte cap — that is what bounds it — so the guarantee is about dispatch, not about reading. A hardening step added ahead of the token check would make the perimeter the trust boundary instead of the signature.
- **Channel identity is asserted POSITIVELY**: `activity.channelId` must equal `msteams`, never "not some other channel". An Azure Bot resource serves Web Chat (enabled by default) and can serve Direct Line off the SAME endpoint with the SAME credential, and on Direct Line the client composes the `from` object — so a negative test would hand a sender-chosen identity to `allowed_emails`, and would fail open on the next channel Microsoft adds.
- **An approval widget carries a per-prompt nonce, minted from one place**: ACP request ids restart at 1 in every provider process, so a control left in a chat from a previous run names an id that is live again for a DIFFERENT tool. Slack, Discord, Telegram and Teams all mint through `messaging.renderer.new_approval_nonce`, compare with `secrets.compare_digest`, retire the nonce with the prompt, and fail CLOSED when none was armed. Three independent copies of that is how one ends up with a weaker token or none at all — which is the state Telegram shipped in. The session picker's nonce (`PickerRegistry.mint`) comes from the same function: a press on a stale list of sessions is the same hazard, so it is not a reason for a second generator.
- **Session resume has ONE controller and routing machine, not one per channel**: `SessionResumeController` is the only consumer of `ResumeSurface`; it owns eligibility/search delegation, the picker registry, access audit, transcript existence, both conflict checks around the awaited UI settlement, expectation-before-success ordering, the atomic inbound claim, dashboard push, and the final audit. Dashboard keys are the default eligibility. A resume-capable channel passes only its canonical native key; the controller applies one exact-bucket policy with its own `SessionMap`. Discord, Telegram and Teams include generations in the current private conversation's exact durable bucket, resolving irreversible filename folds through `SessionMap.channel_key_for_stem`; only a mapped generation with a real history row is eligible. A zero-turn generation holds no work to recover and creates no picker row. Explicit `new` still records and flushes a monotonic generation floor on every DM channel, so a restart cannot seed the prior generation and append the next message to old history. Other users, agents, shared conversations and channels remain excluded. `SessionBinder` owns routing, refusal settlement, and release. Discord and Teams supply address and owner identity, their widgets/cards and exact copy/display redaction, callback parsing, and channel-local replay. The machine is where a mistake routes somebody's transcript into someone else's chat, and its hazard is timing: between the durable record read and the live session-map read a binding can appear, vanish or move, so ONE call returns ONE `RoutingDecision` — where the message runs, the refusal that stops it, and the settlement owed once that refusal is delivered. Two resolver calls with an await between them let the binding change in the gap and the routing check fall through to the conversation's own session, silently. A second copy of either transaction is not a maintenance cost, it is a second chance to get it wrong.
- **There is ONE auto-approve grant, and a channel does not get its own**: every surface that can arm it — the dashboard toggle, `/yolo` on seven channels, and Teams' approval card — goes through `safety_override` via `messaging.commands.run_yolo_command`. A channel-local trusted set is a second grant with its own lifetime, its own audit trail and its own answer to "is YOLO on?", and it has to reimplement the expiry, renewal and auditing the shared helper already owns. Slack's `is_slack_session_trusted` predates this and is the one exception; a new channel follows the seven. It also follows that a control which arms the grant must NAME its blast radius: Teams' button says "Approve + auto-approve", not "Trust session", because the effect reaches every surface until the grant expires.
- **A model-authored label is never interpreted as a command**: an `[OPTIONS:]` chip re-dispatches with `interpret_commands=False`, exactly like a drained queue payload. Display redaction does not strip a leading `/`, so with interpretation on a model that emitted `[OPTIONS: /dashboard | cancel]` renders a chip whose single tap mints a dashboard login credential.
- **An option button is bound to the session that posted it**: Discord and Telegram encode `opt:<index>:<tag>`, where `session_provenance_tag` is a stable 12-hex SHA-256 digest of the posting session key. The raw key never reaches client-visible callback data. A press is checked before busy handling and again after idle/daily rotation; a mismatch or an untagged legacy button fails closed. A valid press against a busy session is refused rather than queued or steered, because those paths retain only bare text and would replay the choice with no tag to validate.
- **Attachment ingest belongs to the frame that awaits the turn**: download after the busy check, in the dispatcher, and unlink in that frame's `finally`. Ingesting at arrival and unlinking there leaves a QUEUED message's prompt naming files that were deleted minutes before the drained turn read them, and the encoder skips a missing path silently. It follows that an attachment-bearing message is never steered (a steer carries text only) and never read as a command (the caption lives in `text`); the queue entry carries RAW descriptors and the drained turn re-ingests them.
- **An outbound refusal is never budget-dropped**: when extraction has already CUT a reference's markup, its refusal line is the only surviving trace of the file, so it is appended unconditionally and the caller chunks. Trading the line for staying inside one message is the one outcome that leaves the user with neither the picture nor a reason.
- **A permanently undeliverable route is dropped, a transient failure is not**: `TeamsSendError` carries the Connector status and only `403`/`404` retire the persisted `serviceUrl`. Keeping a dead route turns every later cron result and mirror leg into a red badge nothing can clear; dropping one on a hiccup makes an outage look permanent.
- **An SSRF vet checks the RESOLVED address, not only the name**: a name blocklist cannot see that a public name an attacker controls points at `127.0.0.1` or `169.254.169.254`, and a wildcard-DNS host needs no zone control at all. Resolution goes through one seam, refuses if ANY answer is private/loopback/link-local/reserved, refuses on failure, and runs on every redirect hop. **And the addresses it approved are the addresses that get dialed**: the vet returns EVERY address it checked and the caller opens its session on the connector `link_unfurl.pinned_connector` builds, so the client performs no second lookup for a rebinding answer to land in. **All of them, not just the first** — a client dials a resolver's answers in turn, so a one-address pin turns a dead CDN node, or an AAAA record on a host with no IPv6 route, into a failed fetch that worked before the pin existed; every entry passed the same check, so the whole set is as safe as its first element. The pin lives in `link_unfurl.py` beside the vet whose result it serves, because every caller of the vet needs it, and `limit=1` and `family=AF_UNSPEC` live in the factory because a caller that keeps the resolver and drops the family re-opens the window. Its consumers are the link-preview handler and `wecom/media.py`. `teams/client.py` and the meetings calendar provider pin through their own resolvers, deliberately: one keeps a bounded MULTI-HOST map for a long-lived connector that re-vets each redirect hop, the other is reached per calendar host, and a factory built for one URL and one session serves neither. The residual gap is now one case and is stated rather than implied away: **a fetch through a configured operator proxy**, where aiohttp hands the proxy the hostname and resolves nothing locally, so there is no lookup for a pin to answer and the proxy's own resolution is the one that reaches a socket.
- **A routing reference is durable, and losing it never blocks delivery**: the Bot Framework exposes no lookup for a conversation's `serviceUrl`, so `teams/service_urls.py` persists it. Loading is lazy and off-loop (never the boot path), every read failure degrades to the in-memory map, a non-`https` row does not survive a reload, and an identity row whose conversation did not survive is dropped rather than advertising a target with no route to it.
- **A turn that produced text but landed none of it is a FAILURE**: `DiscordRenderer.delivery_failed` is "seals were attempted AND none landed", and the dispatcher records `record_failure` rather than `record_success` when the turn accumulated text and that observable is true. A revoked token or a dropped network fails every send while the turn still returns its text, so filing it as a success hides the outage behind a healthy success rate and leaves the transcript claiming a reply the channel never carried. Deliberately not "any send failed": one failed length rotation whose retry succeeded still reached the user. A muted conversation runs a `SilentRenderer`, which attempts no send and so never reports one.
- **A turn that ends with no text never reads as a finished reply**: either the text is delivered, or an explicit notice is posted AND recorded. The driver states the verdict once (`empty_turn_notice`, see Layer 2) and the renderer and the dispatcher both read it, so the bubble and the transcript cannot tell two stories; a notice Discord never took is an undelivered turn (`record_failure`); a raised turn records its error from the `except` branch. A bare placeholder under a "Finished in" footer, or a transcript that ends on the user's row with nothing to say why, is the incident this rule exists for.
- **A compaction receipt reads the compaction RESULT, on every channel**: `wait_for_compaction()` reports a failed or timed-out compaction by RETURNING `{"type": "failed"}` or `{"type": "timeout"}`, not by raising, so an `except` branch alone never sees those outcomes. Every channel's manual `/compact` branches on that `type` — `completed` gets the success receipt, `failed` the channel's failure text, anything else a timed-out receipt (the Chinese-language surfaces share `messaging.commands.COMPACT_TIMED_OUT_REPLY_ZH`) — and a dispatcher's own hard-threshold compaction (`_maybe_notice`) never posts its "compacted automatically" notice for any result but `completed` (Webex posts its failure notice instead; Feishu, iMessage, Teams, WeCom, Weixin and WhatsApp post nothing and log the result at WARNING). Announcing success off the back of "no exception" tells the user their context shrank when it did not, so the next turn fails on context size with no hint why.
- **A cron run notifies ONE surface**: a job belongs to the conversation that scheduled it, so when the job pins no `channel` and `_deliver_cron_to_channel` reports a DELIVERED send to the origin channel, the Slack owner-DM leg stands down. A pinned `job.channel` keeps its Slack delivery, and a Slack-origin, dashboard-origin or origin-less job keeps Slack too, which is every job an install carries today. The stand-down is gated on that send's own return value, never on a predicate answering whether it would have worked, so a governance refusal or a wire failure falls through to Slack instead of dropping the run.
- **Transport shutdown is quiescent**: a client that fast-acks inbound work in background tasks cancels and awaits those tasks before closing their shared network session or returning from shutdown. Teams owns this ordering in `TeamsClient.close()`, and `DiscordClient.close()` cancels and gathers `_handler_tasks` before closing its `ClientSession`, so a gateway teardown cannot leave a turn unwinding against an already-closed session, which surfaces to the user as a reply that silently stops mid-stream rather than as a shutdown.
- **An inbound file fetch is host-bound and refuses redirects**: a download whose URL comes from the platform's own event envelope is not a URL we chose, so it is validated before any credential is attached to a request for it: HTTPS, a host inside the platform's domain, the default port, `allow_redirects=False` with an explicit 3xx refusal, a bounded timeout, and off-loop writes. Redirects matter specifically because aiohttp REPLAYS an explicitly set `Authorization` header across one, so following a redirect would bounce the credential to an arbitrary host and the host check would have been true only of the hop that did not carry the bytes. Slack's `download_file` is the case where this is load-bearing (it sends the bot token); `discord/client.py::download_attachment` guards its credential-free CDN fetch the same way.
- **A reconnect cannot hot-loop on an accept-then-close edge**: a connection must live at least `_MIN_HEALTHY_CONN_SECS` for its CLEAN close to reset the backoff counter, so a repeating immediate close stays on the exponential curve. Webex, WeCom and Discord all carry this guard. Without it a clean-disconnect branch that resets the attempt count makes the backoff curve unreachable and nothing bounds the request rate, and Discord bans an identity for 10 minutes after 10,000 invalid requests, so the cost is the channel, not just CPU.
- **Session keys are namespaced**: every key is `channel_type:conversation_id`; only bare legacy Slack `thread_ts` keys are shimmed, via `canonical_key`/`legacy_key`.
- **Runtime identity follows the current turn**: every channel dispatcher passes its trusted transport name as `runtime_source` to `ContextBuilder.build_message`; the shared `drive_turn` pipeline uses `ChannelTurn.channel_type`. A cross-surface resume keeps its original stable session key for conversation continuity, but `[RUNTIME]` names the interface carrying the current message. Follow-up turns refresh the marker because the one-time session context may describe an earlier surface.
- **A turn uses its captured execution record, never an agent-name lookup**: channel turns resolve `memory_store=` through `context.session_store_for_turn(ctx_builder, session_key)`. The canonical record fixes member/store before provider work; a template or display alias cannot choose memory. Optional learned-memory preparation runs off the event loop. A missing member database leaves manual essentials and the task usable while explicit memory tools report the unavailable store. Temporary mode never opens memory. An ordinary V1 session without member metadata retains its Global path; malformed or missing member identity refuses instead of selecting Global. `scripts/check_memory_store_seam.py` gates omitted routing on changed turn-running call sites; see [memory-skills-hooks](memory-skills-hooks.md#how-a-turn-running-surface-names-its-store).
- **Channel dashboard visibility is immediate**: after the first successful turn of a Discord, Telegram, Webex, Teams, WeCom, Weixin, or Feishu-owned session is persisted, the dispatcher triggers the channel-slot reconciler immediately when `dashboard.surface_channel_sessions` is enabled. `DashboardState.register_channel_transport` injects the dashboard state into the bound dispatcher; the lifetime 30-second reconciler remains the recovery path, but the normal first-turn path does not wait for it. Turns that resume an existing `dashboard:` session skip this step because that session already owns a slot.
- **Filing an EXISTING conversation takes an explicit click, and a different guard from the automatic one**: turning `session_folder` on files conversations from that point forward, and by construction leaves every conversation that already existed where it was — `channel_slots.needs_default_filing` refuses any record carrying `channel_origin`, which every conversation the dashboard has ever saved carries. That refusal is correct for a background pass: from the record alone it cannot tell "never filed" from "filed, then moved to the top level by the user", and the safe reading of an ambiguous record is to leave the placement alone. So the catch-up path is a separate, user-initiated one. `POST /api/channel-folders/backfill` (body `{namespace}`, one literal route shared by all ten channel panels, loopback-only) runs `channel_slots.backfill_channel_folder`, which reuses the whole filing mechanism — `update_metadata_if` compare-and-set, folder tags read fresh inside `tags_write_lock` and written atomically with the `channel_folder_filed` marker, live slots re-placed and one `slots` push — under `needs_backfill_filing`: `needs_default_filing` minus the `channel_origin` clause, so the two records that mean the USER placed this (`folder_id`, and `channel_folder_filed` with no folder beside it) still refuse, and the one that only means the conversation predates the setting no longer does. The write also passes `require_existing=True`, because `needs_backfill_filing` cannot express existence: an empty record passes it, which at scan time correctly means "nothing has placed this", but under the write lock the same value also describes a conversation that has been DELETED, and this pass has the feature's widest gap between reading a candidate and writing it — up to `BACKFILL_MOVE_LIMIT` lock acquisitions and awaits. Without the flag the merge upserts, and the deletion is undone as a metadata-only stub filed into the folder with no transcript behind it: a sidebar row that opens onto nothing, which this button has no undo to walk back. So two refusals reach the not-filed branch and neither is retried nor counted as a failure — the guard saw a placement or a filing marker the user made while the pass ran, or the conversation was deleted while it ran and there is nothing left to file. Both are decisions rather than errors, and no write was attempted in either. It is NOT wired into the settings save: those endpoints fire on every unrelated field, so a token-only save would silently bulk-move conversations. A conversation whose OPEN TAB already shows a folder is skipped too, because a drag sets the slot before its save lands and the record the guard reads is momentarily behind the user. Ephemeral conversations are never given a placement. One click is bounded by `channel_slots.BACKFILL_MOVE_LIMIT`, newest first, and the response reports `remaining` (both the capped-out conversations and the failed writes) and `failed` (the failed writes alone, so the panel can tell a capped run from a failing one) so a partial pass is visible as partial rather than as a refusal; filing is idempotent, so a second click continues. The response NAMES every conversation it moved, redacted through the transcript read boundary, because there is no bulk undo and that list is the only record of what happened. The panel shows the first eight and puts the rest behind an expander rather than a "N more are not listed" note: the run that moves the most is a first run over months of history, which is the case this exists for, so the receipt that must be complete is exactly the one a cap would gut. The report carries ONLY what that panel renders (`folder_name`, `moved`, `reason`, `remaining`, `failed`) -- it IS the response body, so a field no reader consumes is a claim every path through the function still has to keep true.
- **An owner notification is not Slack-only**: `dashboard/server.py::_dm_owner` prefers the owner's Slack DM and falls back to registered channel transports (`_notify_owner_channels`). It used to no-op entirely without Slack, so an expiring unattended grant was invisible on a Teams-only, Discord-only or Telegram-only install — silence about a security grant lapsing is exactly what the notice exists to prevent. Fallback, not addition: an operator with Slack gets one notice, not one per channel. Reachability is the transport's OWN answer, so this can only reach a destination that channel already authorized. **And a channel must be able to NAME the owner: exactly one configured target, or nothing.** The notice carries the operator's own security state, while an allow-list is a list of people permitted to talk to the agent — not a claim that any one of them is the operator. With several configured targets there is no unambiguous owner, and sending to the first reachable one hands one allow-listed human another's auto-approve state; the count is over ALL configured targets, because a three-person allow-list with one learned route is still a guess. Same premise as `/sessions`' owner-only rule. Per-identity authority within an allow-list would let this deliver on a multi-person install; it does not exist yet on any channel.
- **A bot post never makes the platform fetch a preview, and there is no parameter that re-enables it**: every URL in outbound text is agent-authored, and a server-side preview fetch is a request the recipient never clicked — it reaches the URL's host from the platform, carrying whatever the query string encodes, before any human has seen the message. So the suppression is unconditional per channel: Slack's `post_message`/`post_blocks` always send `unfurl_links=false, unfurl_media=false`; Discord ORs `SUPPRESS_EMBEDS` into the flags of every outbound message including ephemeral interaction responses; Telegram passes `link_preview_options={"is_disabled": true}` on every text-bearing call, send, draft, EDIT and the plaintext retry alike (an edit is the same boundary as a send — a clean first post whose text is edited afterwards would otherwise reach the fetcher unchecked). **The client interfaces carry no opt-in parameter at all**, which is the control rather than a default: a flag is one bit a prompt-injected agent can ask a forwarding caller for, and `api_send_message` REFUSES an explicit `unfurl_*=true` with HTTP 400 `unfurl_disabled` rather than dropping it silently — `false` and absent stay accepted, so the only rejected value is the one that used to enable the fetch. **Where the claim is narrower than the headline is Slack, and it is narrower because the API has no parameter there — on TWO paths, not one**: `chat.update` and `chat.postEphemeral` accept no `unfurl_links`/`unfurl_media` argument at all (passing one earns `invalid_arg_name`), and neither do the streaming calls `chat.startStream`/`chat.appendStream`, which are the PRIMARY delivery for agent text (`slack/renderer.py` defaults `_use_slack_stream` to true and sends `markdown_text` through them). So the flags `chat.postMessage` carries have no counterpart on the path most Slack agent text actually travels, nor on the edit path the cursor fallback uses. Whether Slack's fetchers unfurl a link delivered by a stream or introduced by an edit is a live-behaviour question about their servers, not a flag this code can set, so it is verified rather than asserted — the streaming path, the edit path and the ephemeral path are all on the live-check list in #12699, and a mitigation lands only if an unfurl actually appears. What those paths DO enforce today is the Block Kit media refusal, which is a boundary this code owns. The seven other channels were audited rather than patched: none has a bot-triggerable server-side preview (WhatsApp sends plain `conversation` text, Teams text activities do not auto-unfurl, Webex and iMessage render previews on the recipient's own client, Feishu/WeCom/Weixin send text or bot-built cards), so no code was added where no fetch exists.
- **Block Kit media is refused at the client seam, because the unfurl flags do not govern it**: a `blocks` tree naming `image`/`video` blocks or `image_url`/`thumbnail_url`/`video_url` fields makes Slack's own servers fetch that media whatever `unfurl_media` says. The predicate and the refusal therefore live on `slack/client.py::post_blocks`, `update_message` and `post_ephemeral` (raising before any Slack call), not one layer above them: the gateway has roughly twenty direct `post_blocks` callers and a check above them is a check each of them can forget. The agent-facing `send_message`/`update_message` routes keep their own HTTP 400 with the machine-readable `blocks_remote_media_disabled` code and ask that one predicate. `get_user_profile`'s `image_url` is read-only profile metadata, not an outbound tree, so it is unaffected. Design record: `docs/request-for-change/rfc-redaction-explain-and-reveal.md`.
- **The proactive PRODUCERS started Slack-shaped, and the parity claim tracks how far that has moved**: `api_send_message` (the LLM-facing `send_message` tool) began with exactly two legs — the origin dashboard slot and `state.slack_client` — and `file_send` still posts to the Slack upload route. The tool's own explicit addressing now exists for every registered channel and does consult `state.channel_transports`: `channel_type` (+ optional `target_id`) for the conversation the session belongs to, and `session="<channel>"` for that channel's configured owner. See § Proactive sends. What remains Slack-only is the shape of `channel`/`user`/`thread_ts`, whose allow-list and threading semantics are Slack concepts, and `file_send`'s upload route. The `unfurl_*` fields are Slack-shaped too but are no longer live send semantics: they are refused, not forwarded (see the preview invariant above). For a Slack-linked `file_send`, the native document-channel leg has no destination; its routine skip is omitted from the tool result, while a successful Slack upload is reported explicitly for every resolved identity (the endpoint answers ok-without-`skipped` only on delivery). A cron result also still reaches a non-Slack channel when its origin slot is MIRRORED there (`/link`).
- **An opt-in deep-link button rides the Slack owner-DM leg only**: `send_message`'s `include_session_link` boolean (default false; declared in `SEND_MESSAGE_SCHEMA` because `validate_tool_args` rejects any descriptor field the schema does not declare) appends an "Open session" Block Kit button that deep-links to the CALLING session's dashboard tab. The URL is resolved server-side in `_resolve_session_link_url` from the verified caller identity (a cron links to its origin via `_channel_delivery_key`; every other caller via the kernel-attested `X-Session-Key`), so the agent never assembles it and the link can only name the session that sent the message. The button is built ONLY when the flag is `is True` AND the send reaches Slack AND there is no explicit `channel`/`user` target — i.e. the owner-DM fall-through — because the link carries a presigned `token_auth` click token (expiring with `LINK_WINDOW_SECS`) that must not reach a shared channel; it is silently omitted (message still delivered) for non-Slack delivery, a caller with no open dashboard tab (`dashboard_slot_key`/`state.get_slot`), or no usable origin. It rides the SAME Slack message whenever that message can carry Block Kit blocks — caller `blocks`, or a plain-text send upgraded to a `section` under `_SLACK_SECTION_TEXT_MAX` — so an opted-in send is one message and one notification; it posts as a trailing follow-up only when the primary cannot carry blocks (a caller using `options`) or when Slack rejects the combined post. The retry-without-button fallback keys on `SlackApiError` ALONE (Slack answered ok=false, so nothing landed and a second post cannot duplicate the caller's message); any other exception propagates to the delivery-failed path rather than risking a double post. The tunnel-vs-dashboard origin is the shared `dashboard_link_origin` / `tunnel_origin_if_opted_in` decision (`urls.py`), the same one the chat mirror, the Slack backfill marker and `slack.allowlist.send_dashboard_link` use, so a Slack→dashboard link cannot drift on which origin it names.
- **Configured outbound targets are transport-owned**: `MessagingTransport.configured_targets()` returns opaque `ConfiguredChannelTarget` records for the user-configured destinations a dashboard session may link to, including an explicit unavailable reason when a protocol needs prior inbound state or cannot send proactively. `resolve_configured_target()` revalidates the selected opaque id at the side-effect boundary and resolves it to `(conversation_id, thread_id)`; the browser never supplies an unchecked platform conversation id. Discord exposes configured users and threads, and fail-closes thread resolution unless Discord still reports the allow-listed id as an actual thread rather than a normal shared guild channel; Telegram exposes configured DMs; Webex exposes configured DMs plus, when `webex.allow_group_rooms` is on, each space in `webex.allowed_room_ids` as a `room:` target — and `resolve_configured_target` re-validates a `room:` id against BOTH the switch and the list, because an advertised target id travels through the browser and the LLM (it is the `target_id` an MCP send may name) and the config can narrow after one was minted; Weixin exposes allow-listed DMs plus authorized peers learned under its open policy; Teams destinations become available after an authorized inbound activity supplies a conversation/service URL; and WeCom advertises its allow-listed userids plus, under its allow-all policy, the peers it has learned — each either offered or listed with a reason, because `aibot_send_msg` needs no token but the platform only delivers into a conversation the user has already written to. Feishu destinations are visible but unavailable because replies are anchored to an inbound message (no proactive DM in v1).
- **Configured-target egress is governed at every yield boundary**: the dashboard mirror-link endpoint enters the shared fail-closed `channels` governance ladder before resolving an opaque target (resolution may itself open a remote DM), rechecks before the initial link message, and rechecks before each historical-context message. A profile that narrows after transport startup therefore stops both target resolution and all subsequent sends.
- **`/link` and `/unlink` are one pair with one location**: `rebind_conversation_location` claims what `release_conversation_location` frees, and both take the channel's single `_origin_mirror_link()` value — the release matches an occupied location by VALUE, so a second spelling of "this conversation" lets it miss the binding the bind wrote. Inside the rebind the **claim goes first**: `batched_save` writes on the way out even when the block raises, so an opt-out withdrawal ordered ahead of a refused claim would persist for a link that never happened and silently turn mirroring back on. The value match is the whole `ChannelLink` and nothing else: a `dashboard:`-keyed session mirroring into the DM is swept whatever its key spelling, whether or not it accepts inbound, and whether or not the dashboard has **paused** it — `mirror_paused` is a delivery mute, not a second location, and the sweep drops it with the binding, so one `/unlink` frees the conversation and lifts the session-control refusal that the retained binding was causing (#14068; pinned in `test_discord.py::test_unlink_frees_a_paused_two_way_dashboard_mirror` and, against the real store, `test_session_map_mirror.py::TestReleaseConversationLocation::test_a_paused_dashboard_mirror_into_this_dm_is_swept`). When the paused binding accepted inbound, the unlink takes the resumed-session exit ("Left the resumed session") and frees the location on that path; the dashboard is nudged either way so the chip and the menu stop describing a binding that is gone.
- **A proactive send names its destination and fails closed on it**: `send_message`'s Slack fields and its `channel_type` are mutually exclusive families, a refused channel delivery never falls through to Slack, and every refusal is audited and reported (502 `channel_delivery_failed`) rather than absorbed into a dashboard notification. The destination comes from gateway-owned state — a cron's job `session_key`, or the kernel-attested `X-Session-Key` header — never from the request body. See § Proactive sends.
- **A capability the driver accepts, the shared pipeline must forward**: `drive_turn` hands `TurnDriver` every rung a forked dispatcher does, including `auto_approve_session`. Omitting one is not a missing feature but an ASYMMETRY, and it fails silently in the direction that LOOKS safe and is merely useless: the field existed on the driver while the pipeline never passed it, so an operator's `/yolo` grant — taken from the dashboard toggle or Telegram's `/yolo`, both of which write the same process-global grant — was inert on every channel riding `drive_turn`. Discord's fork does not pass it either, and has no `/yolo`; Telegram's does. The predicate is read PER REQUEST, never captured at turn start, so a mid-turn revoke takes effect on the next tool. The PreToolUse `tool_gate` still runs first, so a hard deny can never be overridden by it.
- **A channel conversation binds itself as origin AND mirror, every turn**: a dispatcher supplies `ChannelTurn.origin_conversation` and `drive_turn` records it via `set_origin_link` (so unattended output — the auto-compact notice — has a target) and `bind_origin_mirror` (so a turn later taken from the dashboard comes back to the chat). Discord and Telegram run their own turn loops and write the same pair themselves, in the same order, on every non-resumed inbound turn (under `dm_scope="unified"` neither records an origin: a bucket that collapses every user's DMs has no single conversation to name). The pair is load-bearing beyond the notice: session control's owner-DM predicate admits a DM's mirror only when it EQUALS the recorded origin, which is how a mirror the dashboard retargeted at a thread is told apart from the DM mirroring itself — see [session-control](session-control.md). Re-asserted on every turn, because a restart, an unlink elsewhere, or a rival claim can REMOVE the binding and none of them repoints one; a binding already aimed elsewhere is therefore left alone. Guarded as a pair at the call site: losing the mirror costs a convenience, while raising there costs the user the answer they are waiting for, and this is the widest call site in the codebase. A channel that omits the field keeps its conversations unmirrored, which is why the roster in `autonudge._CHANNEL_KEY_PREFIXES` (defined in `autonudge_service/model.py`) is narrower than `CHANNEL_SESSION_NAMESPACES` — a loop with no bound conversation fires into nothing while reporting itself healthy.
- **A channel's own session opens its crew log before its turn, as the dashboard runner does**: Discord and Telegram call `messaging.dispatch.open_turn_crew_log` in the same non-resumed branch that records the origin, ahead of `TurnDriver.run`. `crew_log_emit.on_session_opened` is what CREATES a session's crew log (keyed by its ACP session id; a warm reuse is silent, and the emitter's own flag makes the call free while the crew log is off), and until this the channel turn loops opened none — which the work ledger cannot tolerate: it is a projection of the crew log, every `work_ledger_record` / `work_report` write appends one `work/recorded` entry to the ACTING session's log, and a write with nowhere to append is rolled back and refused (`crew_log_unrecorded`). An owner DM admitted as a conductor therefore reached the ledger and lost every write until its log existed. Recorded are only the facts the dispatcher holds: the ACP session id off the provider (no id, no log), the agent, the slot key the dashboard surfaces the conversation under (`transcript_stem`, the same fold as `channel_slot_name`, so the `parent` a dispatched worker's log cites resolves to this log), the served model and cwd off the provider, the model the allocation SELECTED (`SessionManager.allocation_requested_model`, read after the claim like the predecessor — the requested half of the requested/served pair, which a call handed `model=None` cannot know any other way), `resumed` as `get_or_create` reported it, and a class only when the gateway's live memory policy for the key is readable (`ctx_builder.live_memory_mode_for_session`), with `channel=True` and the workspace read off the slot the dashboard surfaces the conversation under (`messaging.dispatch.slot_workspace`: the state's `get_slot` for the `channel_slot_name` fold, its `workspace` when that is a string) — the same source the dashboard runner's writer states it from (`chat_runner._crew_log_workspace`), because a tab on the conversation writes its `session/opened` into this same log and the emitter appends a `session/class` line whenever the class it is handed differs from the last one stated, so two writers naming different workspaces for one session would take turns recording a move that never happened; a conversation with no slot yet (surfacing follows the first persisted turn) states no workspace, which the class fold reads as not yet stated rather than as a value. No `parent`: a conversation the person opened themselves is nobody's child. And `previous_sid`: the store the session supersedes, as the ALLOCATION captured it — `SessionAllocationService.allocation_predecessor(key)`, exposed as `SessionManager.allocation_predecessor`, consumed by the dispatcher right after `get_or_create` returns (`messaging.dispatch.predecessor_sid`). The boundary reads the mapping — its live id, or the stash a compaction recycle leaves in `discarded_sid` — inside the registration's own critical section, under its lock and before the new sid is mapped or its mapping deferred. No read taken around the call can stand in for that: a caller reading the mapping before `get_or_create` can be suspended INSIDE the allocation, waiting for the turn permit, while a concurrent turn on the same key allocates an intermediate session and has it recycled by a failed compaction — its value then names the store before that intermediate one, so the successor cites its grandparent and the intermediate log falls off the succession chain; read after the call, the mapping already names the successor itself. The capture is stamped on the registered session (`_Session.predecessor_sid`) and read off the live one, so a warm claim reads back what its session was registered with, ordinary teardown releases it (a table keyed by session key would grow by one entry per `/new` or generation rotation), and the emitter writes the `previous` edge only when it creates the log, so the repeated read costs nothing. It runs for every channel session the dispatcher drives, including a same-DM native history picked through `!sessions` / `/sessions` — no dashboard runner ever handles those turns — and skips only a resumed dashboard session. The dashboard runner has a source the channel dispatchers do not — the store its slot last handed to a `session/opened`, recorded on the slot as that edge is spent — and latches `mapped_sid` before its own allocations only as the fallback for a slot this process has not opened a log for; that fallback read still carries the in-allocation window and may adopt the boundary's capture in a later change. The emitter compares and writes the edge only for a different id whose header names the same slot; a warm turn or a `session/load` resume hands over the live id and writes nothing. The emitter is imported inside the opener, not at module scope: `messaging.dispatch` sits on the dashboard's boot path (`dashboard.handlers.crew_log` reaches it) and a flag-off launch must not load the crew-log package (`test_crew_log_routes.py::test_this_module_does_not_load_the_storage_package_at_import`). A dashboard session resumed into the chat (`!sessions`) is deliberately NOT opened here — its opener is the dashboard runner's, which alone holds its lineage.
- **A proactive send addresses an OPAQUE target, never a platform id**: `POST
  /api/send-message` reads `channel_type` as the transport and `target_id` as the
  optional destination on it — `channel_type` alone means the conversation the
  SESSION already belongs to (`_deliver_to_channel`), and the pair names an
  explicit configured destination (`_send_to_channel_target`), so `target_id` is
  what selects the addressed leg and a `target_id` with no transport to resolve it
  against is the one under-specified combination. The addressed leg
  resolves the id through that transport's `resolve_configured_target`, which
  re-applies the channel's own allow-list at the side-effect boundary. That
  matters because the endpoint is reachable by the LLM and the id travels through
  the browser: a raw conversation id would let a caller name any destination, and
  a config that narrowed after the id was minted would not take effect. Four gates
  run, all fail-closed: a registered transport (membership, never `!= "slack"`),
  `supports_proactive_send`, the `channels` governance chokepoint, then the
  allow-list. The `send_message` MCP tool vets the transport it NAMES rather than
  the literal "slack", because the scope is per-transport. Every non-2xx body
  carries a machine-readable `code`, since backend strings have no catalog path.
- **Own-channel vs. mirror**: `ChannelLink` models a session's own inbound channel only; the dashboard→Slack mirror binding stays in `SessionMap.get/set_slack_link` (guardrail G3). The generalized channel-neutral outbound mirror (`SessionMap.set_mirror_link`) stores a `ChannelLink` under the `mirror` slot for non-Slack channels, still distinct from the session's own inbound link.
- **Managed-MCP session-key resolution**: every turn-running surface publishes `session_pid_<pid>.txt` (with an HMAC-SHA256 sidecar) through the single shared helper `messaging.identity.publish_turn_identity` (which calls `session_pid_sig.publish_session_pid`), keyed by the session's kiro-cli host PID, so the gateway's ancestor PID-walk resolves the caller's `X-Session-Key`. One writer is called by the dashboard, native Slack, and every shipped channel transport-dispatch surface: Telegram (DM + forum), Discord, Slack, Webex, WeCom, Teams, Weixin, and Feishu (through the shared `drive_turn`). Any surface that omits it makes every session-keyed managed MCP tool (`learn_add`, cron management, …) fail with HTTP 400 `missing X-Session-Key` from that channel's turns; the identity-topology test guards every dispatcher against regressing.

## Testing conventions

The extraction is gated by a **golden-transcript** harness (`test/test_slack_golden_transcript.py`): a `RecordingSlackClient` captures the ordered sequence of Slack-render operations the native `handle_message` emits for a scripted `ScriptedProvider` event stream, establishing the baseline the `TurnDriver` + `SlackRenderer` rewire must reproduce identically. Layer contracts and the Slack impl have dedicated suites: `test_messaging_transport.py`, `test_messaging_driver.py`, `test_messaging_privacy_mode.py`, `test_messaging_auto_title.py`, `test_slack_renderer.py`, `test_slack_transport.py`, `test_slack_transport_dispatch.py`, `test_slack_transport_integration.py`. Providers are always mocked (scripted event streams) — never spawn a real kiro-cli process. `test_messaging_import_purity.py` is the gate on the one-way dependency, over every edge including function-local imports, so a new neutral module is covered by it automatically.

## Slack settings API

Three dashboard-only endpoints back the `/settings/channels/slack` panel (legacy `?tab=channels&channel=slack` and `?tab=slack` links redirect there). They are
registered in the dashboard route block (NOT `_register_mcp_routes`, which is
also mounted on the token-less API-only server) so they always sit behind
dashboard token auth.

- `GET /api/slack/config` — masked token previews + presence booleans, owner
  ID, slash command, enterprise-org allowlist, behavior toggles, and live
  status: `connected` (recorded socket connect outcome), `connect_error`
  (short reason, e.g. `invalid_auth`), `read_only` (true unless the request
  is direct-local). Never returns a raw secret.
- `PUT /api/slack/config` — requires a direct-local request (loopback peer
  AND no `Forwarded`/`X-Forwarded-*`/`X-Real-IP` headers); remote gets 403.
  Validate-first/commit-last. New tokens are verified against Slack before
  storage (`auth.test` for bot, `apps.connections.open` for app tokens);
  rejection returns 400 and writes nothing, network failure saves with
  `verify_warning`. `<field>_clear` must be a strict boolean. Secrets land in
  `config_dir/.env` via atomic 0600 `mkstemp` + `os.replace`, and
  `os.environ` is synced afterward. Response `restart_required` is true for
  actual env changes and for `command`, the one Slack config field a running
  gateway cannot apply (the slash command is registered with the app manifest);
  every other field applies live, including `allowed_enterprise_ids`, which is
  re-read through the validated `enterprise.reload_allowed_team_ids`.
  An empty `command` resets the slash command to the default.
- `GET /api/slack/manifest` — public manifest template rendered with
  `?alias=` (default `kirocrew`, never `$USER`) plus Slack's one-click
  create deep link.

`allowed_users` / `open_channels` are intentionally not exposed while the
runtime enforces owner-only access.

## Discord channel

**Transport (`kiro_crew/discord/`).** A concrete `MessagingTransport` over a
pure-aiohttp Discord Gateway WebSocket client (`client.py`): identify with
`DIRECT_MESSAGES` for DM-only installs; when `allowed_thread_ids` is non-empty,
also request `GUILD_MESSAGES` and privileged `MESSAGE_CONTENT`. Heartbeat uses
the server interval with jitter,
resume via `resume_gateway_url`/sequence tracking, exponential-backoff
reconnect, and hard stop on non-recoverable close codes (4004/4010-4014).
Outbound is REST v10 (send/edit/typing/reactions/interaction acks) through one
ladder that spends the rate-limit accounting Discord hands back on every
response: a bucket whose last response reported `Remaining: 0` is waited out
before the next call on it rather than earning a 429, a global 429 holds every
route except the interaction routes Discord exempts, and an invalid-request
breaker trips well below Discord's 10,000-per-10-minutes IP-block ceiling and
refuses to send during a cool-off, because that block costs the whole channel
rather than one call. Failures are classified (`DiscordApiResult`): a 4xx other
than 429 is permanent and never retried, while 429/5xx/timeout/connector
failures retry within per-class budgets. A caller that only checks truthiness
still reads a failure as falsy, so the classification is additive. Malformed
(non-JSON) response bodies degrade to an error result and never propagate into
rendering. Attachments ride the same ladder over multipart
(`send_message_with_files` / `edit_message_with_files`, see "Discord's upload
half" above). No public
webhook endpoint is required. `client.ready` (asyncio.Event) is set on
READY/RESUMED and cleared on disconnect; `maybe_start_discord` reports
`connected` only after `wait_ready` succeeds and keeps the dashboard badge
truthful via the `on_state_change` observer (a non-recoverable close flips it
back off with the reason).

**Security model.** `authorize` is deny-by-default against
`discord.allowed_user_ids` (snowflakes kept as strings — they exceed 2^53).
DM denials and authorization failures in configured threads are SEL-audited.
Because Discord's global guild/message-content intents deliver every visible
channel message, unrelated guild chatter is discarded silently; an approved
user attempting an unapproved thread remains audit-worthy. Guild turns require
an approved sender and either an exact `discord.allowed_thread_ids` match or an
exact `discord.allowed_channel_ids` match. An allowed channel message is never
handled in the shared channel itself: with `discord.auto_thread` enabled, the
transport creates a public thread from that message and dispatches the turn
there. That runtime widening is SEL-audited as a GRANT
(`discord_transport.auto_thread` / `thread_authorized`), not merely on refusal: a
new authorized disclosure boundary appears at runtime, and without the record the
log shows the turns that ran in the thread but never the decision that admitted
it. The allow-set is deliberately unbounded, because each entry is a thread an
already-approved user created, and evicting one would silently stop answering in
a conversation they are still holding. Existing thread IDs still require a REST channel lookup confirming
Discord type 10/11/12. An approved thread is a shared disclosure
boundary: every member who can view it can read agent/tool output. Enabling any
thread also means Discord delivers message content from every server channel
the bot can see, although Kiro Crew immediately discards traffic outside
approved threads. Bot-authored messages (including our own) are dropped as a
loop guard. `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` is on the sandbox agent env denylist.

**Dispatch + rendering.** Turns ride the shared `TurnDriver`.
`transport_dispatch.py` carries the same mid-turn steer/queue/drain/cancel
machinery as the Telegram dispatcher (see "Mid-turn routing, queue receipts &
cancel" above) plus `!compact` under atomic `try_acquire` and the dashboard
mirror `!link`/`!unlink`. A mid-turn message into a busy RESUMED dashboard
session takes that slot's own steer path or queue rather than this machinery
(see "A busy RESUMED dashboard session takes the slot's own machinery"). The renderer streams via throttled in-place edits
under the 2000-char cap, splitting ordinary text with the shared
`split_markdown_safe` (at 1900 less 100 characters of chip/footer headroom)
and holding local-image markup for secure multipart extraction at the semantic
steer/final seal. It rotates messages at the shared driver's structured steer
boundaries with quote chips, renders trailing `[OPTIONS:]` as button action rows
(`opt:<i>:<tag>`, label recovered from the component at interaction time; `<tag>`
is `session_provenance_tag()` — a 12-hex SHA-256 digest of the session key the
buttons were rendered for), and posts
Approve/Deny buttons for interactive tool approvals. Approval `custom_id`s carry a
per-prompt random nonce (`a:<request_id>:<nonce>:<1|0>`) validated at
resolution: ACP request IDs are reusable across provider/gateway restarts, so a
stale button without the matching nonce fails closed. The decision window
denies by default on timeout and retires the nonce with it.

**Option-press provenance.** Discord replays old components indefinitely, so an
option press dispatches only when the session the conversation currently
resolves to (via the resume binding, else the native DM session) is the one the
tag names — a press carries a non-empty tag, and the tag implies resume routing
even though the label never executes as a command (button labels are
model-authored turn content, same rule as the queue drain). The tag is checked
before the busy path — a press against a busy target is refused, never
queued/steered, because the drain replays items tag-less — and re-checked after
idle/daily rotation so it cannot run under a generation the tag never named. A
mismatch (the chat was rebound or `!new`'d since the buttons were posted) and an
untagged pre-provenance button both fail closed with a refusal naming the
remedy; queue drains and AutoNudge fires dispatch untagged with commands off and
keep their native-session affinity.

**Native-generation picker scope.** Discord, Telegram and Teams include persistent
dashboard sessions plus native generations from the current private conversation's
exact durable bucket. A native history filename is never reverse-parsed: every row
must resolve through `SessionMap.channel_key_for_stem`; the canonical candidate must
fold back to the row and share the current key's durable bucket. Selecting one may
replace outbound-only origin mirrors from other generations of the same bucket, but
never an unrelated dashboard mirror. Webex already lists only its current native
bucket and remains read-only. Explicit `new` records and flushes a monotonic generation
floor before replying on all nine DM channels; it creates no zero-turn history row,
and the first real turn creates the recoverable row. A floor-write failure is reported
without rolling back the completed in-memory rotation.

Every turn closes with a **one-line footer** as Discord subtext (`-#`) on the
final segment, rendered by the shared `format_turn_status` (see "Turn-status
surfacing" above): elapsed time plus the context-usage chip. The clock starts when
the renderer is constructed rather than at `on_turn_start`, because the cold start
that spawns and handshakes a session is time the user waited. The usage figure is
read at turn END from the session provider the dispatcher hands over
(`bind_context_source`), so the chip reports the window as the user leaves it, and
an unbound or failing provider renders no chip rather than a reassuring green one.
It rides the last segment instead of its own message (one turn, one bubble, and
Discord charges rate budget per message), and is dropped rather than truncated
when the segment leaves no room: a clipped answer costs the user more than a
missing timing line. When the turn closed with no text, the footer rides the
**placeholder** that stands in for the reply — and that placeholder is the
driver's empty-turn verdict (`Renderer.empty_turn_notice`, see Layer 2) whenever
the driver judged the close, so a turn that produced nothing reads as a sentence
about what happened, never as the same `…` the live frame showed while it was
running under a "Finished in" footer. The bare `…` survives only for a close the
driver did not judge (a cancel), and a close after an exception (the dispatcher's
`finally` reaching `close()` with the turn unfinished) keeps the explicit
`⚠️ Error — please try again`; a stream that ended with no terminal is not that
case — the dispatcher dispatches the `DONE` the driver could not, verdict
attached, so the bubble reads the same sentence as the transcript. The renderer's
"earlier segments carried the turn, stay silent" shortcut yields to the verdict:
an acked steer rotates the pre-steer segment even when that segment was empty and
nothing was posted for it, so a seal count alone does not prove the turn reached
the user, and a turn the driver judged textless posts its notice regardless —
otherwise the dispatcher would record and persist a notice Discord never
carried. The mid-turn steer chip — the `> quoted` line of
the USER's own words that heads the segment when no rotation happened — is kept
apart from that body test: a turn whose only content is the chip produced no
reply and takes the placeholder path with the chip riding on it, rather than
closing on the chip alone under a finished footer. On that path the chip is
bounded to the room `_limit()` leaves beside the placeholder (cut with an
ellipsis, dropped only when no room remains): the placeholder path skips the
length rotation and the client cuts one payload at the platform cap, so an
unbounded chip — each steer is capped by `_neutralize_md`, a burst of them is
not — would push the very sentence this path exists to deliver, and the footer,
past the cut. The chip also passes `_redact_transformed` on that path, before the
bound: it is handed to the client directly instead of through `_seal_current`,
which is where every other route to the sink gets its display-form redaction,
and under a shared DM scope the steer can be another person's words with a
credential in them. The landed placeholder is tallied like a sealed segment, so
the redaction notice follows it.

The dispatcher's record is the other half of that contract. A completed turn
with no text persists the driver's notice as a `notice` row behind the user's
row (the reply is normalized once for the live projection and the disk, so a
whitespace-only reply files no assistant row in either). A turn that RAISED before
the post-turn persist — a backend error, a driver fault — is recorded from the
`except` branch: the user's row, an `assistant` row for whatever channel-safe
text the driver had accumulated when it raised (`TurnDriver.partial_text`, kept
current at every growth site so it survives the exception — the text the renderer
was handed and the user read, minus the short tail the stream redactor was still
holding), and an `error` row (`msg msg-err`, the dashboard
runner's terminal-error class) carrying the redacted, path-scrubbed exception
text under the same 1,000-character cap the memory-store refusal takes, mirrored
into a live dashboard window first under shared row ids like every other write.
Skipped for a restricted (incognito/temporary) session, like the success path.

Two `discord` config toggles shape what else is rendered. Both are re-read from
the live config per turn (`_render_config`), not taken from the boot-time
snapshot, because an operator who turns the reactions off in the dashboard expects
the next message to be quiet rather than the next restart; a failed load keeps the
shipped defaults instead of failing the turn, since neither toggle is a security
control.

- **`reactions_enabled`** (default `true`) is the phase ladder above. Off, no
  reaction is added at all: the renderer never arms a ladder, so there is no
  progress emoji, no stall mark and no terminal 🦞/😱. It is only one of the
  preconditions, so the ladder also stays off for a transport that does not
  declare `reactions` or a turn with no user message to decorate (an injected
  turn).
- **`show_thinking`** (default `false`) surfaces the model's reasoning. On, the
  accumulated reasoning posts ONCE as its own `-# 💭` subtext message ahead of the
  answer, capped at a preview length because subtext is grey and unscannable in
  bulk (the full reasoning stays in the dashboard Activity panel); its own message
  rather than the answer bubble, which is edited in place for the whole turn and
  would overwrite it. Off, reasoning is never even accumulated. Either way the
  ladder still moves on reasoning, because the reaction reports what the agent is
  doing regardless of whether the words are shown.

**No send may notify anyone.** Every message body is LLM- or tool-derived, so
`client.py` puts `allowed_mentions: {"parse": []}` on the JSON body of every
message create/edit through one shared `_message_payload` builder, and on every
interaction callback. That placement is the point: the renderer's text-level
defang (`_DISCORD_MENTION_AT_RE`, a zero-width space after `@`) covers only the
sites that route through `_redact_transformed`, while the option-choice echo, the
help card, the queue receipt, the threshold notice, the session picker and every
proactive delivery do not, and a text guard applied per call site is one new
send path away from being wrong. `replied_user` is omitted (it defaults off): a
reply already lands in the conversation its recipient is reading.

**Display-form redaction is a floor, not a step on the upload path.**
`TurnDriver` redacts the LITERAL form of every chunk upstream; the display pass
(`redact_for_display`) exists for the credential that is invisible until Discord
renders the markdown away. Both renderer sinks therefore run it
unconditionally (`_stream_live` on every live frame and `_seal_current` on every
seal), where gating it on `_uploads_enabled()` had left a restricted session, an
unset upload root, a channel with `files_outbound` off, and **every length
rotation** sending model text the display pass never saw. `_extract_uploads`
applies the pass itself to the text it rewrote, since removing image markup is
one of the transforms that can reassemble a credential.

**Application (slash) commands.** Discord's analogue of Telegram's
`set_my_commands`. `discord/commands.py` owns one ordered `COMMAND_SPEC`
catalogue feeding BOTH the `!help` card (`build_help_text`) and the registration
payload (`application_command_payload`), so the two cannot drift.
`client.register_application_commands` bulk-overwrites via
`PUT /applications/{application_id}/commands`, the whole set every time, which is
what makes it safe to call on every start rather than diffing, using the
`application_id` READY supplies. A row that breaks Discord's own constraints is
skipped rather than sent, because Discord rejects the ENTIRE array on one bad
row. `gateway.py` fires it as a background task rather than awaiting it: the
product is discoverability alone, the gateway boot path must not grow an awaited
network step, and the `!` text commands are the floor if it fails.
`contexts: [GUILD, BOT_DM]` replaces the deprecated `dm_permission`. `queue` and
`steer` are deliberately absent from the menu: they are message PREFIXES, and a
menu tap sends the bare token with no message body to act on.

The client accepts interaction types `APPLICATION_COMMAND` and
`MESSAGE_COMPONENT` (`_HANDLED_INTERACTIONS`); PING, autocomplete and modal
submit are dropped at the dispatch boundary, since each needs its own callback
shape inside Discord's ~3s deadline and a handler that received one without
knowing how to answer would leave the client spinning. Command replies use
callback type 4 with the EPHEMERAL flag (`1 << 6`), because a slash command is invocable
from an approved thread every member can read, and these replies carry runtime
state or a login link. A command is **never** pre-acked as a component:
`DEFERRED_UPDATE_MESSAGE` is component-only, and the one permitted first response
is the command's only route. It also runs the `channels` governance gate BEFORE
responding rather than after, unlike the button path; a governance check slower
than the callback window therefore makes the command visibly fail, which is the
correct direction for a fail-closed gate.

`status` is a single-reply command whose handler takes a `ReplyFn` sink, so the
text and slash surfaces share one body and differ only in where the reply goes.
It reports `Stats().summary()`, the same source Slack's `/kirocrew status` uses,
so the two channels cannot report different numbers for one gateway.

**Discord deliberately offers NO operator-authority command**, so there is no
`yolo` and no `dashboard` here even though Slack and Telegram carry both. One
grants gateway-wide auto-approve and the other mints a bearer credential for the
whole dashboard; `discord.allowed_user_ids` answers "may drive the agent", which
is a weaker claim than either. Keeping them off this channel means the narrower
surface needs no owner-disambiguation rule, no DM-only refusal, and no
credential-issuance audit path -- there is nothing to gate. Do not add them for
parity's sake: parity is measured against what a channel should be able to do,
not against the widest channel's command list.

`model` is button-only and does NOT take a sink: its buttons must live
on an editable channel message, which an ephemeral response is not. Its
`custom_id` is the INDEX (`m:<i>`), never a model id: a custom_id caps at 100
characters and Discord replays old ones indefinitely, so the dispatcher's
TTL-bounded picker registry resolves the index against the exact list it posted
and refuses an expired, evicted or already-consumed one rather than applying a
model from a stale advertisement.

### Resume-binding expectations (`messaging/resume_expectation.py`)

An inbound resume binding lives on the bound session's `session_map.json` row. A recycle, restart prune, or dashboard unlink can destroy that row and the only evidence the channel was attached, so the resolver silently falls back to its DM session; the expectation record makes that loss reportable.

**Store.** `$KIROCREW_HOME/trust/discord_resume_expectations.json` holds channel-id → `{key, title, version, retired}` rows under agent-blocked `trust/`, with an owner-only directory and `restrict_to_owner` file write because modes do not protect files on Windows. `retired` defaults false when loading an older row. Every filesystem step, including `config_dir()`, runs in a worker; an `asyncio.Lock` serializes read-modify-write without spanning Discord I/O.

**Refuse before route.** `DiscordSessionResume.route` returns one `RoutingDecision` containing either the session key or a refusal. Plain turns and session-targeting commands use that decision once; drained turns keep their enqueue-time native decision. `!new`/`!unlink` release every exact-channel binding, `!sessions`/`!help` remain reachable for recovery, and tool approval dispatches no turn while retaining its nonce-keyed visible failure path. Four states run: no owner/no record; no owner/retired record; one owner/no record (bootstrap); one matching owner/active record. Four refuse: active record without owner (lost link, retire after notice), any owner different from the active record or present beside a retired record (announce and adopt after delivery), multiple owners, or a resolution that keeps changing. The owner it refuses against is the third copy of `discord.allowed_user_ids`: `DiscordDispatcher.reconfigure` calls `DiscordSessionResume.reconfigure(self._allowed)` on every reload, re-deriving `owner_id` by the same one-identity rule as construction, so an operator who adds a second identity loses `!sessions` on that reload rather than at the next restart (the Telegram sibling does the same).

**Restricted resumed sessions.** Discord uses the same
`upload_gate.session_is_restricted` decision as Telegram before both post-turn
writers. A restricted dashboard turn skips the direct history append AND
`project_channel_turn_live`; projection is a writer too because it marks the live
slot dirty for a later flush. The LIVE slot is authoritative. With no open tab, a
persisted incognito/temporary marker restricts, and so does an unknown mode whose
transcript EXISTS (an ambiguous stem, or a header no normal session wrote) — that
is where an incognito session hides. Unlike uploads, which deny every unknown,
history allows only a truly ABSENT record, since a legacy header with no marker
reads `persistent` and an absent one claims nothing. Discord offers no rename
command, so there is no separate title writer to gate.

**A failed pick restores what it displaced.** `SessionResumeController.choose`
snapshots the channel's expectation before `record` overwrites it, and every
failed bind path (settlement failure, a conflict re-check, a batch-write failure)
compare-and-sets that snapshot back on the replacement's own version. Retiring the
replacement instead would leave a DETACHED marker where an ACTIVE record used to
be, and that record is the evidence a lost link still owes the user a notice — so
the next message would route natively and the notice would never arrive. With no
prior record, or an already-retired one, retiring remains the faithful undo.

**The binding transaction runs off the event loop, and decides under the lock.**
`batched_save` holds `session_map._MAP_LOCK` across its block and rewrites the whole
map file on the way out, so both the commit and its rollback go through
`asyncio.to_thread` — on the loop that write stalls every task, including the
gateway and heartbeat. Each closure is await-free, because the lock is per-thread
reentrant and an await inside a batch would let another coroutine into the critical
section; `binder.lock` still serializes concurrent pickers. Because the dashboard
and other channels bind WITHOUT that lock, the conflict/displaced decision and both
restore snapshots are re-derived INSIDE the batch rather than reused from the loop:
a rebind landing in the hand-off window would otherwise clear a key whose newer
mirror the pick never saw. The rollback is conditional for the same reason — it runs
in a second critical section, so it undoes a row only while that row still IS this
transaction's own write, compared whole (`ChannelLink.same_row`): a same-location
re-link carrying a refreshed admission is left in place.

**Versioned acknowledgement.** Settlement follows a confirmed send and compare-and-sets the quoted version, so a newer picker/dashboard record wins and failed delivery settles nothing. A delivered detach replaces the active record with a durable retired marker in one write: no owner may route natively, while an owner racing the write still meets retained evidence and is refused before adoption. This avoids a clear-then-restore transaction whose compensating write could fail after evidence was deleted. **Persistence is fail-closed.** Memory publishes only after a durable write; only an absent file means empty, while I/O, UTF-8, JSON, shape, non-integer version, or non-boolean retired errors refuse routing. A pick records before binding. `!unlink`/`!new` serialize map removal, forced off-loop write, and versioned expectation retirement against pickers. Failed forced writes remain owed, keep the active expectation, and visibly fail the command; a later retirement failure costs one self-retiring notice rather than a silent resume.

**Gateway-wide by design.** One unreadable shared file may hide any channel's record, so all Discord routing refuses; a cached-channel exception would silently route the first unknown post-restart channel. Nothing overwrites, quarantines, or discards the file. *Repair:* stop the gateway, copy the file aside, restore or edit it to `channel_id → {key, title, version, retired}` with integer versions and boolean `retired` flags, then restart. Never truncate or delete it; `{}` is valid only when no channel has resume history. **One decision per message.** Route, refusal send, and settlement serialize per channel. Settlement waits for every message queued before the notice; each is refused, and only the last delivered notice settles. **Lifecycle.** This channel-keyed store detects loss but is not routing authority. If a channel-keyed binding authority lands, migrate these rows and delete this state machine.

## Discord settings API

- `GET /api/discord/config` — masked `bot_token_preview` + `bot_token_set`,
  `connected` (true only after the Gateway handshake reached READY this
  session), `connect_error`, `configured` (token AND enabled AND non-empty
  allowlist — the transport fails closed on an empty list), `read_only`
  (true unless the request is direct-local), and the two render toggles
  `reactions_enabled` / `show_thinking`. Never returns a raw secret.
- `PUT /api/discord/config` — requires a direct-local request (loopback peer
  AND no forwarding headers); remote gets 403. Validate-first/commit-last.
  New tokens must match the three-segment bot-token shape (an accidental
  `Bot ` Authorization prefix or `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=` env line is stripped)
  and are verified against Discord `GET /users/@me` before storage; rejection
  returns 400 and writes nothing, network failure saves with
  `verify_warning`. `bot_token_clear` must be a strict boolean.
  `allowed_user_ids`, `allowed_thread_ids`, and `allowed_channel_ids` accept
  numeric snowflake strings only; `auto_thread`, `reactions_enabled` and
  `show_thinking` are strict booleans. Secrets
  land in `config_dir/.env` (atomic 0600) with `os.environ`
  synced; non-secrets go to
  `config.json` under `discord`. Every field applies live, so
  `restart_required` is false for a config-only save: the allow-lists are pushed
  into the transport by `DiscordTransport.reconfigure` and the render toggles and
  thresholds are re-read per turn, while a token change reconnects the Discord
  channel alone rather than the gateway. Promising a restart the user does not
  need is how a settings page trains people to restart for everything.
  Setting OR clearing the token also purges the legacy `discord.bot_token`
  field from `config.json`, and the commit order is config.json FIRST then
  `.env`, matching the Telegram and Webex saves: the gateway falls back to that
  field when `.env` is empty, so a crash between the two writes would otherwise
  resurrect a revoked credential on the next restart, and the copy sits in
  agent-readable `config.json`. Both writes go through `asyncio.to_thread`:
  the atomic write fsyncs, and the owner-only lockdown's Windows DACL write
  can block on a network volume round-trip, neither of which may block the
  gateway loop.

## Telegram channel

The channel's transport, forum routing and mid-turn machinery are described in
the sections above; what follows is what is specific to its rendering and its
Bot API surface.

### Telegram's dispatcher composition

`TelegramDispatcher` is one class composed from owners. `telegram/transport_dispatch.py`
keeps the dispatcher's state and live config, the inbound front door (`handle_message`:
governance, admission, activation, resume routing, the command ladder, the busy check,
rotation and the turn-path privacy apply) and the turn engine it hands an admitted
message to (`_run_turn`). It also keeps the queue drain (`_drain_queue`, `_pump_queue`),
the receipt wrappers (`_receipt_surface`, `_enqueue_with_receipt`,
`_receipt_flip_locked`), `/stop`, `/title`, `_persist_turn`, the restriction predicates,
the conversation-identity helpers (route, session key, `_rotated_session_key`, agent,
origin mirror) and `_user_safe_failure_reason`. Repository guards read those constructs
in this file by path: the tool-gate splat, the turn ceiling and its mute-aware refusal,
the crew-log opener, the persist-then-pin order, the failure charge, `_drain_queue`, the
receipt flip calls, the single rotation site, the title writes, `/stop`'s owner and the
"Telegram failure reason" redaction sink.

Every other responsibility is an owner under `telegram/dispatch/`, and new work of that
kind goes to it:

| Owner | Holds |
|---|---|
| `origin.py` | `_QueuedOrigin`, its sender key, owner token and queue-entry spelling, `_CHANNEL` |
| `addressing.py` | forum activation (`_activation_outcome`, `_addresses_this_bot`) and `_reply_target` |
| `midturn.py` | `_handle_busy`: steer or queue a mid-turn message, with its privacy reservation |
| `pickers.py` | the `/model` and `/agent` keyboards, the `_Picker` record, prune and consume, and their apply (the tables stay on the dispatcher) |
| `callbacks.py` | `on_callback`: every inline-button prefix |
| `spawn_approval.py` | `deliver_spawn_approval` and its destination checks |
| `commands.py` | `/kirocrew dashboard`, `/yolo`, `/cron`, `/spawn`, `/task`, `/link`, `/unlink`, `/compact`, `_require_direct_chat`, `_reply_markdown` |
| `voice.py` | `/voice`, `_voice_enabled`, `_speak_reply` |

A new command's handler goes to `commands.py`; its dispatch stays in `handle_message`.
An owner's function whose first parameter is `self` is bound as the `TelegramDispatcher`
attribute of the same name, so instance and class patches, `inspect.getsource` and every
`self.<name>(...)` call reach it as they reach a method defined in the class body; the
state stays on the dispatcher. A name tests rebind on the facade (`sel`,
`TelegramApprovalDecider`, `list_agents`, `channel_inbound_permitted`, ...) is read
through `kiro_crew.telegram.transport_dispatch` at call time and never bound in an
owner. Owners log under the facade's logger name, and the facade imports every owner when
it loads. `test/test_telegram_transport_dispatch_composition_contract.py` pins the
surface, the patch reach (the rebound set is derived from the tests) and these placement
rules.

### Telegram session resume

`/sessions` and its singular `/session` alias are direct-message-only and
single-operator. With no argument the shared `SessionResumeController` offers the ten
newest eligible rows; search words delegate to `ConversationLog.search_sessions`, so
title/content matching, CJK handling, recency weighting and ranking stay identical to
dashboard history search. Eligibility is persistent dashboard sessions plus native
generations from this exact Telegram DM bucket. Incognito/temporary rows and every
other user, agent, Topic or channel are filtered before the ten-row cap.

Results are nonce-bound inline buttons. A press runs the shared atomic bind transaction,
replays bounded context, and routes later DM messages into the selected session until
`/unlink` or `/new`. It may replace outbound-only origin mirrors from this native
bucket, but never an unrelated dashboard mirror. Irreversible history stems resolve
through `SessionMap`, never guessed colon positions. A zero-turn generation has no
history row and nothing to recover; its first real turn makes it eligible. Titles,
query text, errors and replay are redacted and bounded, and every list read emits
`telegram.sessions_data_access`.

### Telegram's upload half (`telegram/`)

The second channel wired onto `outbound_files.py`, and it differs from Discord in
one structural way: **photos ship as their own message after the text seal, never
as a caption.** A caption is capped at 1024 characters against the message's
4096, `sendMediaGroup` carries no `reply_markup` at all, and the answer has
already been rendered through this channel's HTML / Rich-Message / table
machinery — folding a truncated second copy into a caption would be strictly
worse than one clean bubble followed by its pictures. The picture send is
`disable_notification`, because the answer bubble already pinged.

- **Named ceilings fed in as budgets.** `client.py` declares
  `TELEGRAM_MAX_PHOTO_BYTES` (10 MB — the multipart ceiling, which is the one that
  binds for a local file; by-URL is 5 MB and by-`file_id` unlimited),
  `TELEGRAM_MAX_MEDIA_GROUP` (10) and `TELEGRAM_MAX_TOTAL_UPLOAD_BYTES` (25 MiB,
  the aggregate that bounds resident bytes — ten photos at the per-file ceiling
  would be 100 MiB). `_api_multipart` sits beside `_api` and both run through one
  `_api_request`, so the single 429 `retry_after` back-off exists once. The body is
  a FACTORY, rebuilt per attempt, because an aiohttp form is consumed as it is
  written. Every `attach://` descriptor is built where its part is added.
- **Only semantic seals extract, once.** `_rotate_on_length` holds the earliest
  complete-or-still-arriving reference and its suffix in the live tail
  (`protected_ref_spans`, off-loop), so a length cut can never bisect
  `![alt](path)`; length-sealed chunks pass `extract_uploads=False`. Live frames
  run `hide_local_refs` so no filesystem path flashes and then vanishes.
- **Recovery restores the REFERENCES, not the segment.** Discord sends text and
  files in one multipart call, so its recovery re-posts the whole thing; here the
  text bubble has already landed, so re-posting the source would deliver the
  answer twice. The markup is rebuilt from each `OutboundFile`'s own alt and path
  and sent as one short follow-up, display-redacted.
- **Two gates, both reachable.** `files_outbound` is read before extracting.
  The second is `messaging/upload_gate.uploads_restricted`, which denies an
  incognito or temporary dashboard session. Telegram session resume can carry a
  `dashboard:` key, so the gate applies to those turns exactly as it does on
  Discord; native Telegram session keys remain outside that restricted-dashboard
  branch.

### Telegram's display-form redaction

`TurnDriver`'s redaction is byte-level and runs BEFORE this renderer introduces
markup, so it cannot see a credential that markup will REASSEMBLE:
`redact_credentials("AKIA**IOSFODNN7EXAMPLE**")` matches nothing because the `**`
sits inside the key, and `_md_to_telegram_html` then emits
`AKIA<b>IOSFODNN7EXAMPLE</b>` — which Telegram displays as an intact access key.
A link (`[AKIA](https://x)REST`) and a zero-width character between the halves are
the same hazard. `messaging/display_safety.redact_for_display` canonicalizes to the
rendered form and scans both it and the literal; it runs at the two sinks — the
live plaintext frame and `_seal_text`, ahead of the HTML, Rich and plaintext
branches alike. A redaction can push text past the budget that sized it; the seal
re-measures and re-splits, and losing formatting to keep a rendered secret
redacted is the intended direction of that trade.

The screen also reads the text as `_strip_md`, the plain-text fallback, shows it:
code fences, inline code, heading markers, `**` and `__` removed and then every
link flattened to `label (url)`, in that order. Those six passes are ONE set of
pattern objects and replacements, the `TELEGRAM_FALLBACK_*` patterns and
`TELEGRAM_FALLBACK_PASSES` that `display_safety` defines and this renderer imports
(the screen is a leaf, so the definition lives on its side); `_strip_md` and the
HTML translation apply the same objects, and `test_markdown_link_parentheses`
fails on a second spelling of any of them in either module, on a pass added,
dropped or reordered, and on any placement of `[`, `]`, a delimiter pair and
`(https://x)` around a split key where the screen and the fallback disagree. The
heading pass is shared because removing `# ` can expose a named credential
assignment. The bullet pass writes a visible bullet in place of its marker, so it
leaves a separator and stays the renderer's own. That reading matters here for two shapes.
The fallback prints a link's url beside its label, where the rendered form hides
it, so a key split by `**` inside a url is whole only in that reading. And the
fallback links AFTER it drops delimiters, where the screen's rendered form links
first: `AKIA[IOSF...]**(https://x)**` is text to the rendered form's link pass and
a link to the fallback once the `**` is gone, so the fallback shows
`AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE (https://x)`. The screen answers both with the rendered
form, which drops the url, and whose settling passes collapse and redact the
link the delimiters closed. `TELEGRAM_FALLBACK_LINK` reads a link with the
screen's grammar: the shared `constants.md_link_destination` url pattern (one
level of balanced parentheses, a backslash escape read as one token, a `[label](`
inside the url ending the link), an `https?://` scheme, no whitespace in the url,
and a label holding no `[`, `]` or line break, so the HTML and plaintext branches
link exactly what the screen collapsed. An emitted form is rendered and redacted
again until the text stops changing, at most `DISPLAY_SETTLING_PASSES` (4)
times; past that, every markup character outside a redaction tag is removed
before the final redaction.

### Telegram's stall marks, and why it has no phase reactions

Slack tracks turn phase with a debounced reaction on the user's own message. That
does not port: a bot holds exactly ONE reaction per message (setting is a replace,
not an add), `setMessageReaction` accepts exactly **73** emoji — with no globe,
wrench or brand mark among them, and `✅`/`🚀`/`⏳`/`🤖` all absent — a chat's own
`available_reactions` can narrow that further at any time, and Telegram's rate
limit is per CHAT, shared with the streaming edits the answer already spends. So
the phase indicator would compete with the answer for the same budget.

What Telegram lacked was not "working" (the typing indicator and the `🔧 {tool}…`
footer say that) but "working, and nothing has moved in a while". Two marks ride
the footer the renderer was going to edit anyway — `🥱` at 15s, `😨` at 45s, the
Slack controller's own thresholds — read from the clock rather than latched, so
they clear themselves when output resumes. They never reach a sealed message.

`client.REACTION_EMOJI` is the validated 73-member set, spelled without U+FE0F to
match the Bot API reference; seven members are documented bare while every keyboard
emits the VS16 form, and the two major Python libraries disagree about which three
carry it, so `normalize_reaction_emoji` strips it on both sides of the membership
test. `set_message_reaction` refuses an off-list emoji locally with a log line
instead of spending a round-trip on a guaranteed 400, and returns whether Telegram
accepted it — passing the global list is necessary but not sufficient.

### Telegram's option-button provenance

Trailing `[OPTIONS:]` choices carry `opt:<index>:<tag>` in `callback_data`, with
`<tag>` produced by the shared `session_provenance_tag` from the renderer's resolved
session key. The label remains button text rather than callback data, keeping CJK and
emoji labels out of Telegram's 64-byte payload budget; at the 25-button ceiling the
largest payload is 19 ASCII bytes.

The callback retires the keyboard, rejects an untagged legacy button, and re-dispatches
the recovered label with command interpretation disabled. The dispatcher compares the
tag before reading busy state, refuses every tagged press while that session is busy,
and compares it again after idle/daily rotation. A button posted before `/new`, an
agent switch, or an automatic generation rotation therefore cannot inject its
model-authored label into the replacement conversation, and a busy queue cannot strip
the evidence needed to validate it later.

### Telegram's approval nonce

`callback_data` is `a:<request_id>:<nonce>:<1|0|t>` and the nonce is what a press is
actually validated against; the key it is filed under is `session_key:request_id`,
and neither half of that is unique over time. ACP request ids are REUSABLE — a
provider or gateway restart resets the sequence — while the conversation generation
folded into the session key only changes on `/new` or an idle/daily rotation. So a
provider restarting mid-conversation issues request id 1 again, and a button still in
the chat's scrollback from before the restart carries that same id. Without the nonce
that press resolves a prompt for a tool the user never read: on Approve an unrelated
tool runs, and on Trust the conversation also gains standing auto-approve that
spawned subagents inherit.

`register_nonce` mints 8 bytes of `secrets` entropy per prompt (16 hex chars),
`resolve_global` and `is_pending` both refuse on a mismatch via `compare_digest`, and
the nonce is retired in the decider's `finally` alongside the future — a nonce that
outlived its prompt would re-open the window on the next reused id. All three buttons
of one prompt share its nonce, because they are one decision point and a Deny press
has to be able to retire the prompt an Approve press could have taken.

The window opens with the nonce, not with the wait. `TelegramApprovalDecider.arm`
reserves the future and `__call__` adopts it, because `TurnDriver` dispatches
`PROMPT_CHOICE` and only then awaits the decider — and between them the renderer
suspends across two `asyncio.to_thread` display-safety scans and the send. A press in
that gap resolves the reservation, `__call__` returns that decision without waiting,
and `is_pending` reports the prompt live so a Trust press grants. Minting the future
in `__call__` instead loses such a press: it is reported as an approval that already
expired, the Trust gate grants nothing, and the request denies itself when the window
elapses. `arm` never replaces a live future and is inert off the event loop, where no
waiter can exist, which keeps it usable as a pure nonce operation. Three paths close a
window no wait adopted: `retire(key)` where the caller falls through to another
surface (the spawn-approval gate, and a send that raised), `refuse_undelivered(key)`
where the driver WILL still await — Telegram reports a failed send by returning no
message id, so the refusal is recorded on the reservation and denies at once instead
of spending the whole window on an invisible prompt — and `discard_session(session_key)`
in the dispatch's per-turn `finally`, for a prompt that went out before the turn ended
early. Each drops every reservation no wait OWNS, whatever state its future is in: a
decision no wait adopted has no reader, and retaining it leaves the nonce live for a
button still in the chat.

Budget: Telegram caps `callback_data` at 64 BYTES. The fixed parts cost 21, leaving 43
for a request id. A button rendered before the nonce existed has no nonce segment, so
the right-to-left parse leaves part of the id where the nonce belongs and the compare
fails closed, which is the correct answer for a press from an earlier process. Same
mechanism as Discord's (see above); Slack still lacks it, and its `block_id` has room
for the same fix.

### Telegram's durable `getUpdates` cursor

Calling `getUpdates(offset=N)` is ALSO the acknowledgement for everything below
`N`, so an in-memory-only cursor means a restart re-requests from 0 and Telegram
redelivers every update the previous process never confirmed — the user's last
messages arrive a second time as fresh turns. The cursor is persisted to
`$KIROCREW_HOME/routing/telegram_offset.json` (atomic write, off-loop, written only
when it moved), on the same reasoning as the iMessage watch cursor.

**Under `routing/`, which is a keystone leaf, and that is not incidental.** The same
property that makes the cursor useful makes it dangerous to leave writable: an
offset is an acknowledgement, so a plausible-looking large value makes the gateway
skip every queued and future message, and it survives the restart that would
otherwise clear it. An agent that could write the file could therefore switch off
the operator's own Telegram intake, durably and silently. It shares the directory
with the Teams routing store because they are two shapes of one control — where a
message GOES, and which messages are SEEN — and the DIRECTORY is what `security`
registers, since `atomic_write` publishes through a temp sibling in the same parent
and a file-name leaf would leave the pre-rename window open. A pre-keystone cursor
in the data-home root is DELETED rather than migrated on the next start: a cursor at
a writable path is exactly the "cursor we cannot trust" that `_load_offset` already
answers 0 for in five other cases, and the cost of dropping it is the one bounded
replay that method documents as the accepted degradation.

What is persisted is a **low-water mark**, not what the poll observed. `_in_flight`
holds every `update_id` handed to a handler; `_persistable_offset()` returns the
observed cursor when nothing is in flight and the oldest in-flight id otherwise.
Resolution happens in the handler's `finally`, so it covers refusal and exception
as well as delivery — all three are terminal, and a cursor advancing only past
SUCCESS would replay every deliberately-dropped update (an unauthorized sender, a
sticker) on every restart forever. An album's ids ride with the merged message and
resolve as a unit, since replaying half an album delivers the same photos under a
caption that no longer matches. `_get_updates` writes nothing; the polling loop
persists once the whole batch is registered. Writes go through `_persist_offset`,
which is serialized by a per-loop lock and refuses a value that is not an advance:
two turns finishing hand two writes to the thread pool, nothing orders those
threads, and a regressed file re-answers turns that were already answered.

**This bounds duplicate replay, NOT loss.** `getUpdates(offset=N)` is Telegram's
own acknowledgement and there is no call to un-confirm, so once the loop polls
again an in-flight update is gone server-side whatever the local file says, and a
crash mid-turn loses that message. Closing that needs either inbound serialized
behind turn completion (a long turn would then block `/stop`) or the update PAYLOAD
stored durably before it is confirmed, which is a persistent inbound queue and a
separate feature. Every unusable file (absent, unreadable, non-JSON, wrong shape,
negative) reads as 0, which is exactly the pre-persistence behaviour, and a write
failure costs one replay window rather than the channel.


## Telegram settings API

Two dashboard-only endpoints back the `/settings/channels/telegram` panel (legacy `?tab=channels&channel=telegram` and `?tab=telegram` links redirect there). Like the
Slack settings API they are registered in the dashboard route block (NOT
`_register_mcp_routes`) so they always sit behind dashboard token auth.

- `GET /api/telegram/config` — masked bot-token preview + presence boolean,
  `enabled` flag, `allowed_user_ids` (serialized as digit strings for the tag
  editor), `soft_threshold_pct`, forum per-topic config (`allow_forum` bool and
  `allowed_forum_chat_ids` — negative supergroup chat_ids serialized as strings
  for the tag editor), and live status: `connected` (true only
  after startup proved the token with an authenticated `getMe` and the
  long-polling transport started; when Telegram is unreachable at boot the
  channel still starts and reports not-connected until the first successful
  poll — only a *rejected* token aborts startup and closes the client; the
  polling loop updates the flag live, deduped on state change — three
  consecutive `getUpdates` failures flip it false with a reason, the next
  success flips it back), `connect_error` (token-free short reason:
  `TelegramAuthError` message for a rejected token, exception class name
  otherwise), `read_only` (true unless the request is direct-local), and
  `configured` (token AND enabled AND non-empty allowlist — the transport
  fails closed and rejects every message while the allowlist is empty).
  Never returns a raw secret. Token presence considers both the
  `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` credential and the legacy `telegram.bot_token` config
  fallback.
- `PUT /api/telegram/config` — requires a direct-local request (same gate as
  the Slack save); remote gets 403. Validate-first/commit-last. Pasted tokens
  are shape-checked (`<bot_id>:<secret>`) and verified against Telegram
  `getMe` before storage; rejection returns 400 and writes nothing, network
  failure saves with `verify_warning`. `bot_token_clear` must be a strict
  boolean. The secret lands in `config_dir/.env` as `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN` via
  the same atomic 0600 write, and `os.environ` is synced afterward. Setting
  OR clearing the token also purges the legacy `telegram.bot_token` field
  from `config.json` — the gateway falls back to that field when `.env` is
  empty, so leaving it behind would resurrect a removed credential on the
  next restart. `allowed_user_ids` accepts digit strings or ints and stores
  canonical deduplicated ints; `soft_threshold_pct` is an int in 1–100.
  `allow_forum` must be a strict boolean; `allowed_forum_chat_ids` accepts
  integer-like strings or ints and stores canonical deduplicated ints —
  supergroup chat_ids are NEGATIVE (e.g. `-1001234567890`), so the validator
  accepts a leading minus (NOT the digits-only check used for
  `allowed_user_ids`) and rejects non-integer garbage.
  Every Telegram config field applies live: `TelegramTransport.reconfigure`
  replaces `allowed_user_ids` and `allowed_forum_chat_ids`, `allow_forum` and
  `soft_threshold_pct` are read per turn, and a `bot_token` or `enabled` change
  reconnects the Telegram channel alone. `restart_required` is therefore true
  only for a `.env` credential write.

## Webex channel

**Transport (`kiro_crew/webex/`).** A concrete `MessagingTransport` over a
pure-aiohttp Webex client (`client.py`): inbound rides a device-registration
WebSocket — the client registers a device with the Webex Device Management
service (WDM) to obtain a per-device WebSocket URL, connects, authorizes with
the bot token, and receives `conversation.activity` events (the same
mechanism the official `webex-bot` SDK uses; no public webhook endpoint is
required). **Caveat: WDM is an internal Cisco mechanism, not a documented
public API.** Cisco can change frame shapes or endpoints without notice, and
behavior may vary across geo/FedRAMP clusters (the client defaults to the
`wdm-a` host and the `us` Hydra cluster; both the WDM base and the REST base
are constructor parameters for containment). The documented alternative
(webhooks) requires a public inbound URL, which contradicts the local-first
design — this trade-off is deliberate. If WDM drifts, the failure mode is a
truthful "Not active" badge with the reconnect reason (the
`ready`/`on_state_change` machinery), never a silently green channel. A
manual live smoke test with a real bot token is a launch gate for this
channel. Activity events are treated purely as signals: the raw UUID is
Hydra-encoded (`base64("ciscospark://us/MESSAGE/{uuid}")`) and the message is
hydrated via the documented `GET /v1/messages/{id}` REST call in a background
task so the receive loop keeps breathing during long turns. Outbound is REST
(`POST/PUT/DELETE /v1/messages`) with a single 429 `Retry-After` back-off; an
email-shaped conversation id maps onto `toPersonEmail` (opens/reuses the 1:1
space server-side). Outbound markdown is bounded in UTF-8 BYTES, not
characters — Webex's limit is 7439 bytes. The renderer's own final answer is
chunked by `messaging/split.py::chunk_utf8_bytes`, which is byte-exact and **lossless**:
the concatenation of its chunks equals its input. That is the property the table
path requires, because an oversized safe-raw grid is chunked here and must
reassemble exactly, and a line-oriented splitter cannot promise it — it consumes
the boundary whitespace (pinned by
`test_channel_table_rendering.py::TestDeliveryFraming`). The accepted cost is that
`chunk_utf8_bytes` carries no fence state, so a code fence spanning a chunk boundary
lands unbalanced; trading the grid's exact reassembly for that is the worse of the
two. The fence-safe `messaging.split.split_markdown_bytes` — shared splitter
against a character budget, shrunk until every chunk measures under Webex's byte
cap, with the `chunk_utf8_bytes` primitive for a fragment admitting no clean cut —
is what Webex gets through `chunk_for_transport` on the mirror and proactive legs,
which carry no grid. Single sends are tail-guarded by `truncate_utf8` as a last
resort, so a multibyte-heavy reply is never rejected wholesale by the platform.
Redelivery is handled at the
frame: each processed activity is acknowledged (``{"type": "ack", ...}``) and its
message id remembered in a bounded FIFO, because an unacked activity is redelivered
and a redelivery arriving mid-turn would otherwise be folded in as a steer — the
agent steered by an echo of the instruction it is already following. The reconnect
loop uses exponential backoff with a
minimum-healthy-connection guard so a bad token can never hot-loop.
``client.ready`` (asyncio.Event) is set on connect+authorize and cleared on
disconnect; ``maybe_start_webex`` reports ``connected`` only after
``wait_ready`` succeeds and keeps the dashboard badge truthful via the
``on_state_change`` observer (a disconnect flips it back off with the
reason).

**Security model.** `authorize` is deny-by-default against
`webex.allowed_emails` (lowercased comparison); every denial is SEL-audited.
Self-messages are dropped twice (WS actor email + hydrated `personId` against
the bot identity). `WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN` is on the sandbox agent env denylist.

**The allow-list IS the operator tier, and that is the cross-channel design.** No
shipped channel carries a second, narrower "owner" check: Telegram's `/yolo` and
`/kirocrew dashboard`, Teams' `/yolo` and Slack's `!yolo` are all reachable by any
authorized sender, and Webex matches them rather than inventing a tier one channel
has. So an operator adding a second address grants that address the process-global
`safety_override` grant (`/yolo` — the same one the dashboard toggle and the CLI
drive) and dashboard-link minting. What bounds it is attribution plus audience:
both commands SEL-audit the sender's email, and `/kirocrew dashboard` refuses
outside a direct room so a presigned link is never posted where a space can read
it. A narrower tier here would also silently break the ordinary case of one person
with two addresses; if per-sender capability limits are wanted, they belong in the
governance profiles that already gate every channel, not in one dispatcher.

The ROOM gate is separate from the sender gate, and a group message must clear
BOTH. A direct room is always permitted. A group space is permitted only when
`webex.allow_group_rooms` is on AND the space is in `webex.allowed_room_ids`,
which is deny-all by default — so enabling the switch alone grants nothing. The
gate is positive membership (`room_type == ROOM_DIRECT` / `ROOM_GROUP`), never
`!= "direct"`, so a room type this code has not seen inherits nothing. Group
spaces are off by default because a reply there is readable by every member,
including people the email allow-list excludes; for the same reason a group turn
constructs its renderer with `uploads_allowed=False` (a local file reference keeps
printing the path) and `_handle_dashboard` refuses outside a direct room.

An Adaptive Card press reports no `roomType` on the wire, so the client resolves
it (`_room_type_of`, cached) before dispatch rather than letting the gate
special-case it — a second branch there has to guess, and a guess that admits a
press by room id alone drops every DM press the moment a space is named. The
`denied_room_not_permitted` record carries the room id, which is the one thing an
operator needs from it: a Webex room id is opaque and has no UI that shows it.

A space is its OWN conversation. `_route_of` returns the sender's email for a
direct room and `space:{room_id}` for a group space, and that one string is the
`ConversationState` bucket, the generation seed AND the session-key scope — so
they cannot disagree about which conversation a message routes to. The space is
namespaced `CHAT_TYPE_FORUM`, which is what keeps it out of the `unified` DM
bucket. Routing a space to a participant's DM key would answer their private
history into the room, make a mid-turn DM steer into the space turn, and let
`/new` in the space reset their DM.

In a space Webex only delivers messages that @mention the bot and does NOT strip
the mention, so `commands.strip_bot_mention` removes a LEADING mention of the
bot's own name (matched on a word boundary, so `Kiro` does not eat the `Kiro` in
`KiroCrew`). A mention later in the sentence is content and is left alone.

**Files.** `files_inbound` and `files_outbound` are both live. Inbound: a message
arrives on the `share` verb (not `post`), so the accepted-verb set is what makes
file messages visible at all; `webex/attachments.py` HEADs each opaque
`/v1/contents/{id}` URL for its name/type/size and hands the result to the shared
`messaging.attachments` ingest, which owns caps, classification, signature
sniffing and temp-file ownership. The download honours Webex's anti-malware state
machine — 423 retry-after (bounded), 410 infected, 428 unscannable, all refused
rather than passed `?allow=unscannable` — and refuses a URL outside the API base
so the bearer token cannot be sent elsewhere. The `update` verb fires when a scan
clears and is acted on only once every file reads a safe quarantine state; a
pending scan is deliberately NOT dedup-marked, so the later clearing update is
not mistaken for a redelivery. Outbound: `client.send_file` takes the validated
BYTES from `messaging.outbound_files`, never a path — re-opening the path would
resolve the name a second time and could upload something no gate saw. One file
per message is Webex's limit, so a run of files is a run of messages.

**Adaptive Cards** are Webex's Block Kit analogue (`webex/cards.py`, schema 1.3,
one card per message) and `rich_blocks` gates whether one is attached at all. A
press returns as the `cardAction` verb whose `inputs` map merges the pressed
action's own `data`, which is how the routing key round-trips — the same
mechanism as a Slack `action_id`. Three things make a press safe: the reserved
`data` keys are namespaced so a card input cannot forge a decision; a choice
travels as an INDEX into the choices that renderer rendered, so a crafted press
cannot inject text; and each card carries a per-prompt nonce compared in constant
time, which is what retires a resolved card — Webex refuses to edit a message
carrying an attachment, so its buttons stay clickable forever otherwise. A card
is always accompanied by the text form, which works on its own.

**Geo routing.** A Hydra id names a CLUSTER, and synthesising `us` makes a
non-US-resident org drop every inbound message silently: the REST fetch resolves
nothing and the failure surfaces as no reply behind a green badge. The cluster is
therefore read from the activity's own `target.globalId` and remembered per
connection, and the WDM host is discovered per token from the U2C service catalog
(falling back to the documented US host, so a discovery outage degrades rather
than taking the channel down, and never to a plaintext host — the bearer token
rides these requests). `webex.wdm_base` PINS a **Webex** host for a restricted network. It is
suffix-checked against `*.wbx2.com` / `*.webex.com` / `*.ciscospark.com` over
https and dropped (loudly, falling back to discovery) otherwise, because
`config.json` is an ordinary settings file — the sandbox seals it read-only against
an in-sandbox agent shell, but `security.py` deliberately does not over-block it
for the operator's own writers — and the bot token rides device registration, so a
value from a mistaken or coerced `config set` would otherwise POST the token
wherever it named. An
outbound proxy belongs in `HTTPS_PROXY`, which the client honours separately. The
same suffix rule is applied to the catalog's own `serviceLinks.wdm` as defence in
depth. Otherwise:
the pin is held separately from the host in use and skips discovery entirely,
because discovery WRITES the host in use, so a pin stored only there is destroyed
by the first successful discovery and the config key silently becomes a no-op
after one connect. An empty value is what means "discover", so no caller may
default it.

**Dispatch + rendering.** Turns ride the shared `drive_turn` / `TurnDriver`
pipeline. `transport_dispatch.py` intercepts the command surface (`/new`,
`/compact`, `/help`, `/stop` + `/cancel`, `/link`, `/unlink`, `/yolo`,
`/kirocrew dashboard`, `/model`, `/sessions`, plus the `/queue` and `/steer`
per-message overrides),
queues or steers mid-turn messages, drains the queue after the turn, runs
`/compact` under atomic `try_acquire`, and posts soft/hard context-threshold
notices as separate proactive messages. `COMMAND_SPEC` in `commands.py` generates
the `/help` card, so the card cannot drift from the parser; an unrecognised
`/token` answers with the card rather than spending a turn having the model
explain it. `/compact` reads the compaction RESULT rather than assuming success —
the ACP client synthesizes a completion whenever text streamed, so a compaction
that reported `timeout` or `failed` used to be announced as done.

**Interactive tool approvals accept a typed reply OR an Adaptive Card press.**
`on_prompt_choice` posts its own message asking for `1` (approve) or `2` (deny),
with an Approve/Deny card attached. The typed reply is PRIMARY, not a fallback:
Webex refuses to edit a message once it carries an attachment, so a resolved
card's buttons stay clickable forever, and the inbound half of a press rides the
undocumented device websocket. The dispatcher intercepts either ahead of the steer
path, because the session semaphore is held for the whole turn so an answer
necessarily arrives while the session is busy. An unrecognised reply still steers,
so a user who ignores the prompt does not lose their message.

The pending-decision registry is channel-neutral (`messaging/approval.py`): a
process-global map keyed `session_key:request_id` because ACP request ids restart
at 1 per session, deny-by-default on timeout, and a timeout also signals
`AutoNudgeService.notify_approval_stalled` (`autonudge_service/timers.py`) so an unattended
loop pauses (stays active, fires nothing) instead of
burning its cycle budget being denied; a human's answer through the same registry
releases that hold (`release_approval_hold`), and the loop resumes on its own. The card's nonce is minted by that registry
against the pending entry and validated INSIDE `resolve()`, as a precondition:
checking it around the call would approve the tool first and only then discover
the press was stale. A press carrying no nonce or request id fails closed, and
every outcome — honoured, stale, expired — emits a SEL record, because a forged
press leaves no other trace. A channels-governance deny blocks an approve but
still resolves a deny, so a policy that forbids the channel does not strand the
tool request for the whole window. An answer that matches nothing is reported
neutrally ("already answered or timed out"), never as a denial: with buttons the
platform cannot retire, "already answered" is the common case and claiming a
denial would tell a user their approved tool was refused.

The renderer is shaped by Webex's 10-edits-per-message cap: no typewriter
streaming (`streaming=False`). A "🤔 Thinking…" placeholder is posted at turn
start; status frames carry the running tool AND a bounded tail of the answer
buffered so far, so a long agentic turn shows the answer forming instead of a bare
tool name. The budget is split explicitly — status frames get 8 of the 10 edits,
2 are reserved for the final answer, and a failed edit burns the remaining status
budget so the final edit can never race the cap. Frames are paced by a DOUBLING
interval rather than a flat one: a flat throttle spends the whole budget in the
first few seconds and then freezes for the rest of the turn. The final answer
lands as one placeholder edit with a fresh-message fallback plus chunked
follow-ups. A folded steer is noted on that final edit rather than posted
separately. `[OPTIONS:]` choices render as an Adaptive Card of one `Action.Submit` per
choice, capped at `cards.MAX_CARD_ACTIONS` with the overflow numbered into the
body by the shared `apply_options_cap`, so widget and text form ONE list. Card and press agree on button order through
`cards.usable_choices`, the single derivation both read — deriving it twice would
let one dropped blank choice shift every index after it, and the button would
answer with its neighbour. What the card offered is published to
`cards.LiveChoices`, owned by the DISPATCHER: the card is the last thing a turn
sends, so a renderer-owned map would be gone before any press arrived. Entries are
one-shot and expire by replacement, because the platform cannot retire the buttons.
A press re-dispatches the label with `interpret_commands=False` — the label is
model-authored, so a `[OPTIONS: … | /yolo on]` trailer must not become a command —
and the choice is echoed first, since a press leaves no trace in the room. An unterminated `[OPTIONS…` fragment is hidden in a STATUS FRAME only, where text
is still arriving and it may be a marker mid-flight. The sealed answer keeps it:
this renderer buffers a whole turn and sends once, so by `on_done` such a tail is
the assistant's own prose and cutting it is permanent loss — the same trade
`render_options_as_text` makes for the other non-streaming channels. `on_done` delivers the WHOLE answer before uploads and the card, so
neither interrupts a chunked reply.

## Webex settings API

- `GET /api/webex/config` — masked `bot_token_preview` + `bot_token_set`,
  `connected` (true only while the device WebSocket is connected + authorized
  this session), `connect_error`, `configured` (token AND enabled AND non-empty
  allowlist — the transport fails closed on an empty list), `read_only`
  (true unless the request is direct-local), plus `enabled`, `allowed_emails`,
  `allow_group_rooms`, `allowed_room_ids`, `reply_in_thread`,
  `soft_threshold_pct`, `hard_threshold_pct` and `session_folder`. Never returns a
  raw secret.
- `PUT /api/webex/config` — requires a direct-local request (loopback peer
  AND no forwarding headers); remote gets 403. Validate-first/commit-last.
  New tokens (an accidental `WEBEX_BOT_TOKEN=` env line is stripped) are
  verified against Webex `GET /v1/people/me` before storage; rejection
  returns 400 and writes nothing, network failure saves with
  `verify_warning`. `bot_token_clear` must be a strict boolean.
  `allowed_emails` accepts syntactically valid emails only.
  `allowed_room_ids` is de-duplicated with order preserved and is otherwise
  unvalidated: a Webex room id is an opaque base64 blob whose shape is the
  platform's to define, and a format guess would reject a legitimate id from a
  cluster this code has never seen. The two thresholds are clamped as a PAIR
  through the same helper the config dataclass uses, so a soft value above the
  hard one cannot make the soft nudge unreachable. Secrets land in
  `config_dir/.env` (atomic 0600) with `os.environ` synced; non-secrets go
  to `config.json` under `webex`, and any token set/clear purges the legacy
  `webex.bot_token` config fallback (config.json commits before .env so a
  crash between the two cannot resurrect the plaintext copy). Writes are
  serialized under the repo-wide config lock. Every field applies live —
  `WebexTransport.reconfigure` replaces `allowed_emails`, `allowed_room_ids` and
  `allow_group_rooms`, the thresholds and `reply_in_thread` are read per turn,
  `session_folder` is read where the session key is built, and a `bot_token` or
  `enabled` change reconnects the Webex channel alone — so `restart_required` is
  true only for a `.env` credential write.

## WeCom channel

**Transport (`kiro_crew/wecom/`).** A concrete `MessagingTransport` over WeCom's
AI-bot **long connection** (`client.py`): one outbound WebSocket to
`wss://openws.work.weixin.qq.com`, authorized with a bot id + secret via an
`aibot_subscribe` frame. Inbound user messages arrive as `aibot_msg_callback`
frames carrying a server-assigned `headers.req_id`; the bot replies by echoing
that `req_id` back on `aibot_respond_msg` frames whose `body.stream.content` is
the **full accumulated text**, so each frame REPLACES the bubble rather than
appending to it. A `stream.id` groups the frames of one bubble and `finish=true`
seals it. Each inbound frame is fast-acked into its own turn task so the single
socket keeps serving pongs during a long streaming turn. Turns ride the shared
`TurnDriver` through `drive_turn`, so WeCom inherits redaction, the approval
ladder, `SilentRenderer` muting and `publish_turn_identity` rather than
re-deriving them.

**Reply-ACK semantics are the load-bearing detail.** `send_stream` returning True
means the frame reached the socket, never that WeCom accepted it. Acceptance
arrives later, on a **cmd-less** frame carrying `headers.req_id` plus an
`errcode` — the same envelope shape as a pong ack and as the subscribe ack, so
the three are told apart by id, not by shape:

- The **ping** ids are tracked in a set as they are sent.
- The **subscribe** id carries a fixed prefix (`_SUBSCRIBE_REQ_PREFIX`), which is
  what makes a rejected credential detectable at all. Without it the only signal
  is the server closing the connection immediately, which is also what an
  anti-kick looks like — so an operator with a wrong secret was pointed at the
  wrong cause. A rejected subscribe reports not-healthy on the settings badge
  (the documented compensating control for skipping save-time verification) and
  does **not** stop reconnecting, because a secret can be corrected while the
  gateway runs.
- Anything else is a **reply** ack. `846605` (unroutable `req_id`) and `846608`
  (bubble past the platform's 10-minute stream lifetime) are terminal for that
  `stream_id`, so the client records it and `stream_is_dead()` reports it.

Neither the `errcode` nor the `errmsg` is ever logged or put on the badge:
`errmsg` can echo the rejected payload. Only the classification is surfaced.

**With no usable stream the head goes out CONFIRMED, and it gates the tail.** That
fallback used `send_reply`, whose one-shot POST returns `None` — a lost head was
indistinguishable from a delivered one, and the tail went out regardless, leaving a
fragment the reader cannot tell is incomplete. A push is not a duplicate on this
path (no bubble is showing the text), so it is preferred, `send_reply` remains the
last resort when there is no warm conversation, and if neither delivers the head the
tail is WITHHELD and logged rather than sent alone.

**A withheld tail is the rule on BOTH head paths.** `close()` recovers a refused
head as a confirmed push and then releases the tail — and that recovery can itself be
refused, or find no conversation to push into. `_recover_unconfirmed_seal` therefore
REPORTS whether the head reached the reader, and `_release_pending_overflow` withholds
and logs when it did not. Without that the recovery path shipped a tail whose head
never landed, which is the same fragment the no-stream fallback already refuses to
send.

**A failed dispatch releases its dedupe entry.** The `msgid` window means "already
delivered", and a turn that RAISED was not. `WeComTransport.receive` calls
`forget_msgid` before re-raising, so WeCom's own redelivery — the mechanism that
exists to recover exactly this — is not suppressed as a duplicate of a message nobody
ever answered. Idempotency still holds for the success path, which is what the window
is for.

**Everything that awaits AFTER ingest sits inside the cleanup block.** The dispatcher
deletes the decrypted attachments in a `finally`, so an await outside it is a path on
which a gateway shutdown strands plaintext. The origin bind is one such await (it
offloads to a thread), and it now runs inside the `try` — before the turn, so a
mirrored reply still has its binding, but no longer outside the guard.

**The tail is HELD until the head is resolved.** An over-cap answer seals its head
into the live bubble and pushes the remainder, and the head's verdict arrives after
both — so sending the tail immediately put it ahead of a head recovered at
`close()`, and the reader met the answer's middle before its beginning with nothing
saying the order was scrambled. `on_done` therefore parks the tail on the renderer
and `close()` releases it AFTER the head recovery. The cost is that the tail lands
after persistence rather than before it, so a crash in that one-local-write-wide
window leaves history holding an answer the reader only partly received; that is the
lesser evil, because the misordering needed only a refused frame while this needs a
crash. The alternative considered — re-sending head AND tail on recovery — keeps the
old timing but duplicates every tail chunk.

**The sealing frame gets a SECOND look, for free.** A stream frame's ACK cannot be
waited on (every frame of a turn replays the one inbound `req_id`, so a waiter for
one can be resolved by another's), and `_send_final_chunk`'s dead-bubble check runs
microseconds after the send — so a refusal is normally invisible there and the
answer was reported delivered. `close()` asks again: `drive_turn` calls it in its
`finally`, after persistence and the post-turn notice, so the verdict has had the
length of that real work to arrive at no added latency. If the bubble is refused by
then, the head is re-delivered as a CONFIRMED push (its own `req_id`, so acceptance
is correlatable), consumed once so a second teardown cannot post twice. A bounded
sleep-and-poll was the alternative and is worse: fixed latency on every turn, and
it cannot exit early on success because "the ACK said 0" and "no ACK yet" are
indistinguishable — WeCom is not documented to acknowledge an accepted frame at
all. Delivering the head through the push path unconditionally is worse still: it
posts every answer twice and spends double the conversation's 30/minute budget.

**A sealed bubble rolls, it does not swallow the answer.** An agentic turn doing
tool work routinely runs past ten minutes, and the refusal is asynchronous, so
without this the renderer keeps "succeeding" into a sealed bubble and the rest of
the answer — including the final frame — is never seen. `renderer.py` therefore
consults `stream_is_dead()` before each frame and at `on_done`, and on a seal
mints a fresh `stream_id` and continues there. Because content is cumulative, the
continuation sends only the part the earlier bubble does not already carry.
Where it resumes from is deliberately conservative: the refusal is observed on a
LATER push, so the most recent frame is exactly the one that may have been
rejected, and the continuation resumes from the frame **before** it. One frame's
worth of text can therefore appear twice; a visible repeat is a better failure
than a silent hole. `on_done` rolls only when something is left to deliver, so a
sealed bubble that already holds the whole answer is left unsealed rather than
followed by an empty bubble.

An aged roll resumes EXACTLY, a sealed one conservatively, and the difference is
evidence rather than assumption. Every frame carries the bubble's full accumulated
text, so a non-terminal ACK rejection is normally superseded by the next frame in
the same bubble — unless no next frame comes because the bubble rotates for age,
in which case its last frame was never delivered and resuming after it would skip
it silently (`send_stream` returned True, so nothing reports the gap).
`WeComClient.stream_had_rejection()` answers the narrower question "was everything
written here accepted", covering terminal and non-terminal refusals alike, and the
aged path takes the conservative resume only when it says no. It means "the LATEST
verdict is a refusal", not "was ever refused", and both retirements are load-bearing
for different orderings: sending the next frame retires it (that frame carries the
refused one's text, and this is the only route on a deployment that never ACKs an
accepted frame), and an errcode-0 ACK retires it (the only route when an earlier
frame's refusal arrives AFTER the seal, since nothing is sent after a seal). Left
sticky, `_recover_unconfirmed_seal` re-pushed answers the platform had accepted —
the reader gets the whole thing twice. A TERMINAL refusal is never retired:
`_dead_streams` is separate and permanent, because that bubble can never be written
again whatever is sent to it. Making age
unconditionally conservative instead would repeat a frame's worth of text on every
turn past the rotation age.

Both offsets are REBASED onto the new bubble's start when it opens. They describe
deliveries the abandoned bubble accepted, which say nothing about its replacement,
and 846605 (unroutable `req_id`) refuses every replacement too — so carrying them
forward made a SECOND roll resume from a position recorded against the FIRST
bubble, past a span the replacement never delivered. Rebased, a bubble refused
before it accepted anything resumes exactly where it began, keeping the worst case
a visible repeat rather than a silent hole.

**Security model.** `authorize` is deny-by-default and owner-only: an empty
allow-list authorizes nobody, and the only route to "everybody" is the explicit
`wecom.allow_all_users` opt-in, which still denies a frame with no userid. Two
further gates run in `receive`, both before a turn is dispatched:

- **1:1 chats only.** Group traffic (`chattype` other than `single`) is refused
  and SEL-audited (`denied_group_chat`). A WeCom group is a shared disclosure
  boundary, and sessions are keyed on `userid` alone, so a group message would
  ALSO run inside that user's private DM session — publishing its history and
  tool output into the room, and letting the room steer a session the user
  believes is private. The userid allow-list does not help: the sender is
  allow-listed, the audience is not. Same reasoning as iMessage's group
  fail-closed. Per-group sessions plus a group allow-list are the prerequisite for
  lifting this, and Webex is the channel that has both: it keys a space session on
  `space:{room_id}` and admits one only when `webex.allow_group_rooms` is on AND
  the space is in `webex.allowed_room_ids`. WeCom is not there because neither
  half exists for it.
- **Redelivery suppression.** WeCom names `msgid` as the dedupe key and documents
  that a callback may be repeated, and each repeat would run the whole turn
  again — a second provider round-trip, a second set of tool side effects, two
  answers in the bubble. A bounded, TTL'd window suppresses the repeat. It is
  consulted AFTER authorization, so unauthorized traffic cannot evict genuine
  entries and reopen the gap; an absent `msgid` is never suppressed, because no
  id is no evidence of a duplicate.

`WECOM_SECRET` / `WECOM_BOT_ID` are on the sandbox agent env denylist, and
`pod/runtime.py` forces the channel off in a sanitized pod seed.

**Tool approval rides the ONE shared grant, with no WeCom command.** WeCom renders
no approve/deny widget (`max_buttons=0`), so `decider` is `None` and
`APPROVAL_INTERACTIVE` is deny-by-default: without an out-of-band grant every tool
request is refused with nothing the user could click. `ChannelTurn.auto_approve_session`
supplies `() -> safety_override().is_active()` — the same process-global grant the
dashboard toggle drives, read per request rather than captured at boot, so arming it
or letting it lapse takes effect on the next tool instead of after a restart. It does
not weaken the gate: the keystone, the governance ceiling and the deny-list all run
ahead of that rung in `TurnDriver`, so a hard DENY still wins and only the prompt is
skipped.

There is deliberately **no `/yolo` command here**, which is why the surface stays a
predicate rather than a handler. One switch with one answer beats a per-channel copy:
a channel-local command would need its own owner rule, and the single global
`KIROCREW_OWNER_ID` is compared against each channel's own id space, so on a host
running several channels the configured value belongs to at most one of them. The
operator arms the grant from the dashboard (or Slack) where that ambiguity does not
arise.

**Cancellation cleanup is offloaded, and submitting it is what makes it durable.**
Both `except BaseException` guards (the shared per-attachment ingest loop and
WeCom's transcribe step) delete through `cleanup_offloaded`, not `cleanup`:
`os.unlink` is a blocking syscall, TMPDIR is not always local, and the cap is ten
attachments per message, so inline it stalls the gateway on exactly the path a
shutdown takes. The two ways the offload can fail need OPPOSITE handling, and
getting it backwards is invisible either way. `CancelledError` from the await is
NOT a fallback trigger: `to_thread` submits to the executor before it awaits, so
by then the worker owns the deletion (and still drains through
`shutdown_default_executor`) — deleting again would repeat the work and put the
blocking syscalls back on the loop, on the very path where the stall is worst.
`RuntimeError` is the only fallback: the loop refused the work outright (closed,
executor shut down), so nothing else will ever delete those files. Both return
normally rather than re-raising, because the caller is about to re-raise the
exception it was handling and this one would replace the real reason the turn
ended.

**An attachment makes the message CONTENT, never a command.** Every command branch
returns before `_ingest_media` runs and a WeCom media URL lives ~5 minutes, so a
photo captioned `/new` reset the conversation and the picture never arrived — no
error, nothing said about it, and the URL was dead before the user could resend.
The rule is about the early RETURN, not about parsing: the command intercepts and
the bare-override usage reply are disabled when `inbound.attachments` is non-empty,
while `parse_mid_turn_override` stays live because it only strips a prefix and the
media still reaches ingestion on the same path. Slack draws the same line with `and
not files` on its stop keyword. A command sent in its own message is unaffected.

**`ChannelTurn.auto_approve_session` is what makes that promise true.**
`TurnDriver` has always accepted the predicate, but the shared `drive_turn` did not
forward it, so a channel driven through this skeleton could report the grant as ON
while every tool request still hit the deny-by-default path — invisible from the
channel side, since the `ChannelTurn` looked correct. The field is optional and
defaults to `None`, so every channel that offers no in-channel toggle is unchanged
and the grant is simply not consulted. It is forwarded as the CALLABLE: a grant
that lapses mid-turn stops auto-approving the rest of that turn.

**Table rendering converts a SLICE, never the whole answer.** `_carried` /
`_sent_abs` are offsets into `text()`, and a table conversion changes the string's
length — so converting the whole answer and slicing the result would index a
different string and every bubble rotation would drop or repeat text. `_render_slice`
therefore runs on the slice about to be sent, progress is recorded from the RAW slice
BEFORE the transform, and the final chunks are converted once after the split so the
sealing frame, the overflow pushes and the late head recovery all carry the identical
string. Identity today (`table_mode="off"`), which is why the ordering is pinned by a
test that fakes a length-changing transform: the two orderings are indistinguishable
until the policy changes, and then the failure is silent.

**A streaming cut may not sever a credential the reader's client will rejoin.** The cap
is applied to the RAW answer, while the reader sees the CANONICAL rendering of each
bubble, so a transformation that happens after the scan can reassemble what the scan saw
as broken: neither `AKIA**` nor `**REST` matches a credential pattern as written, and
neither does `[AKIA](https://x)` beside `REST`, yet the platform renders the markup away
and shows an intact key. Each bubble is scrubbed on its own and matches nothing, so the
per-message redaction cannot see it. `_push` therefore picks the boundary with
`safe_split_offset` instead of cutting at whatever raw character the budget lands on.
Nothing after that offset has been delivered, so the next frame of the bubble carries the
remainder and the answer is not truncated.

`safe_split_offset` asks the question directly rather than guessing which characters could
hide a split. `joins_to_a_credential` puts each side through the same redaction the sender
will apply and then reduces both to what the platform SHOWS, and it reads the pair BOTH
ways, because neither reading contains the other: canonicalising the concatenation is
wider for a run of delimiters, which concatenation can only extend, while canonicalising
each side first is wider wherever canonicalising DROPS text, which is what a link does to
its target. The further readings `redact_for_display` scans are taken both ways as well,
because a pair is graded under every reading a single message is: Telegram's fallback and
its HTML seal both drop a heading marker, so a field name closing one message and
`#   : <value>` opening the next read as the assignment on screen while the `#` keeps them
apart in the literal join and in the canonical form. The splitter's whole-sequence grade
(`_rejoins_a_key`) takes the same readings, for the hard cut that opens a chunk with a
marker the whole text held mid-line. The repair a capped caller runs on a chunk it slices
again (`repaired_for_delivery`, behind `bounded_for_delivery` and the Slack and Telegram
bounding paths) is judged by that same grade on the caller's own re-cut: the caller passes
its cutter, each candidate repair is cut by it and the pieces graded by `_rejoins_a_key`,
and the first whose pieces read clean is delivered. A repair judged by a narrower reading
answers a refusal made on another with nothing; a link whose parenthesised url hides a key
behind a `~~` pair collapses clean under the canonical grammar while the no-parenthesis
reading joins the key, and the heading seam above is visible only in the reading of the
piece the cut opens. The candidates run least destructive first: the key-hiding span closed
up and redacted, then the canonical redacted collapse fixed point, then a last resort
(`_flattened_for_any_cut`) that collapses links to labels, strips every markup character
outside a redaction tag, removes every whitespace run and redacts, so every reading is the
identity on every substring and no cut of it can render a key. A character class or a fixed search window cannot be closed here -- the next
character the set does not know about is one more place a split can hide, and the check
then runs on a span the credential was never inside and passes vacuously.

**Reply length is denominated in BYTES.** `stream.content` and
`markdown.content` are capped at 20480 UTF-8 bytes, so the transport declares
`max_message_chars = WECOM_MAX_REPLY_BYTES // 4` (`WECOM_SAFE_REPLY_CHARS`) as the
floor for a char-only caller AND `max_message_bytes = WECOM_MAX_REPLY_BYTES` as the
real budget `chunk_for_transport` plans against, while
`truncate_utf8` is the exact guard at the wire — the same derivation, and the same
reason, as Webex. Declaring characters directly is what let a Chinese reply sit
under the cap and land ~3x over it, where WeCom rejects the whole frame and the
user gets nothing. An answer longer than one bubble is DELIVERED rather than
truncated: `on_done` splits the remainder with `split_markdown_safe` (fence-safe,
because WeCom renders markdown), seals the FIRST chunk on the live bubble the user
is already watching, and delivers the tail as **proactive pushes** — because a
stream frame's acceptance cannot be confirmed (every frame of a turn replays the
one inbound `req_id`, which is the only key an ACK carries, so a waiter for one
frame can be resolved by another's ACK), while `aibot_send_msg` mints its own
unique `req_id` and its verdict is exact. A refused tail chunk is therefore
reported with its position rather than assumed delivered. This matters because
`drive_turn` persists the full text, so a silent truncation would leave history and
delivery disagreeing about what the user was told.

**A credential may not straddle a bubble ROTATION seam either.** An answer that
outruns a bubble's ~10-minute lifetime is rotated: the current bubble is SEALED
(frozen, never rewritable) and the answer continues in a fresh one. Each bubble is
redacted on its own slice in `_render_slice`, so a credential whose head sits in the
sealed bubble and whose completion opens the continuation matches neither bubble's
scan, and the reader's client renders the two side by side and rejoins the key.
`_push` therefore grades the continuation's head against what the frozen prior
bubble STILL SHOWS — the seam — giving up only the completing span through
`_repair_continuous_seam`, which grades the VERBATIM join. WeCom's answer is ONE
continuous stream across the two bubbles, so the boundary whitespace is real
on-screen text, not a message break. The stripped `repaired_after_a_sent_tail` the
separate-message channels (Telegram, WhatsApp) use must NOT be consulted here: it
strips the boundary whitespace because those platforms drop it between messages, so
on WeCom it would see a join across a space the reader actually sees (`…AKIAIOSF`
then ` ODNN7…` reads as two space-separated tokens, not a key) and over-redact
harmless prose that merely mentions example-key fragments. `_seam_showing` supplies
the seams as a LIST: when the answer has
advanced (`_carried > 0`) the one seam is the delivered answer prefix; when no
answer has been delivered yet (`_carried == 0`) the seams are the reasoning
candidates a reasoning-only bubble was sealed on, so a key spanning the
reasoning→answer boundary is closed too.

**Which reasoning frames are candidates: ALL of them, because WeCom gives no
positive acceptance signal.** Each reasoning frame replaces the bubble's whole
content, so the reader sees exactly ONE — the last accepted. But `send_stream`
never waits for the per-frame ACK (every frame of a turn replays the one inbound
`req_id`, which is the only key an ACK carries, so an ACK cannot be attributed to
the frame that drew it), and `_track_stream` RETIRES any outstanding non-terminal
rejection the instant the next frame is sent. So right after sending frame B,
`stream_had_rejection` is false in the ordinary case — not because B was accepted,
but because nothing has reported on B yet — and B's own rejection ACK can still land
late. There is therefore no point at which a candidate is provably superseded, so
`_shown_reasonings` keeps EVERY frame put on the socket (appended deduped, never
evicted) and the continuation is graded against all of them. The tempting collapse —
drop the earlier candidates once the stream shows no rejection — is unsound for
exactly this reason: it would discard the earlier frame A that is still what the
reader sees when the newer frame B is refused late, and the rotation seam would then
grade only B (ending in prose) and pass vacuously while A's credential prefix
rejoins the answer on screen. A fixed count window is unsound for the mirror reason:
under a sustained run of refusals the DISPLAYED frame is an earlier, shorter prefix,
and evicting the oldest drops exactly it. Retention is bounded instead by dedup
(throttled re-sends of identical reasoning collapse) and by a COUNT cap
(`_MAX_REASONING_CANDIDATES`) on distinct frames — kept SOUND by `_push` STOPPING
reasoning sends once the cap is reached rather than evicting, so the bubble keeps
showing a retained frame and no un-retained text ever reaches the screen (an
eviction could instead drop the displayed prefix). Each suppressed update is
COUNTED and announced once from `close()` as a bounded post-turn notice (the answer
is unaffected), because the AUTOSDE bound rule requires overflow to be said out loud
rather than letting the reasoning preview silently freeze. The cap is SHARED across
`_reasoning_seams` (frozen prefixes carried from prior rolls) and
`_shown_reasonings` (the current bubble): the send-stop counts their combined total,
so the carried-seam UNION at a rotation is already within bound and is NEVER sliced.
Slicing it would be unsound — `[:cap]` keeps the oldest and drops the NEWEST frozen
prefix, which is the bubble that sealed last and sits immediately above the
continuation, exactly the seam a key joins to (nothing follows it, so it is not
covered as a prefix of a later frame). Each retained string is itself
byte-bounded at the append, satisfying `a-bound-bounds-every-field-it-retains` on
both the count and the item. At a rotation the candidates are
carried into `_reasoning_seams` as a UNION while `_carried == 0`: a reasoning-only
bubble can seal, roll to a bubble also refused before any answer, and roll again —
the first roll's frozen reasoning is still on screen above both, so replacing
(rather than unioning) would drop it and leak. Grading against every retained
candidate is the sound direction: over-grading one the reader does not see only
redacts a fragment (cosmetic), while missing the one they do see leaks the key. The
redaction-notice recount runs AFTER this seam pass, so a reply whose only redaction
is a seam repair still announces it.

**The seam-rendered chunks are re-bound by the wire BYTE limit.** The split sizes
chunks in characters (`WECOM_SAFE_REPLY_CHARS` = the byte cap // 4), which has zero
byte headroom only for a chunk of almost entirely 4-byte astral characters — and the
first chunk's seam repair then prepends a ~22-byte redaction tag while dropping fewer
bytes, which can nudge it past the 20480-byte cap. `send_stream`'s `truncate_utf8`
would drop that overflow silently while `drive_turn` persists the full answer, so
after the seam pass each chunk is re-flowed through `split_markdown_bytes` and the
over-byte tail becomes a following chunk (delivered as overflow, never lost). The
re-split is safe because the chunks are already redacted whole: a seam-straddle
credential is a tag at the head and a byte cut falls between tags, not through a key.

The STREAMING path (`_push`) has the same hazard and the mirror fix. A streaming
frame's progress offset `sent_abs` is fixed from the RAW slice before the seam
render, and `send_stream` truncates the rendered frame to the byte cap silently
while returning success — so a seam repair that pushes a near-astral slice over the
cap would advance `_sent_abs` past bytes the wire dropped, and the next aged
rotation (`_carried = _sent_abs`) would resume PAST the undelivered suffix. So when
the rendered frame exceeds the byte cap, `_push` shrinks the RAW slice and
re-renders until it fits, then derives `sent_abs` from that shorter raw slice; the
remainder rides the next frame of the bubble exactly as the character cut already
intends. A credential split at the shrink boundary is caught by the next frame's own
seam grade (its seam is the now-delivered prefix), so shrinking introduces no leak.

**Reasoning is redacted on the JOINED text, because the join is the risk.**
`TurnDriver` redacts each thinking chunk, but with a plain per-chunk pass rather than
the rolling `StreamRedactor` it uses for the answer — so a credential split across
two chunks passes both halves and is reconstituted by the renderer's join. The
assembled string is redacted at the send boundary, which closes that and also covers
an unsplit credential. Same placement, and the same reason, as Slack's
`_maybe_post_thinking`.

**Reasoning has a native home.** WeCom renders whatever sits inside
`<think></think>` in `stream.content` as a collapsed reasoning block, so
`on_thinking` streams there instead of dropping reasoning (as it did) or faking it
as body text — no sibling channel has this affordance. The turn-start placeholder
uses the same wrapper, so it is not stranded above the answer.

**`[OPTIONS:]` degrades to a numbered list** through the shared `format_overflow`
sink, which owns the numbering plus the display-form credential redaction and
mention defanging — a choice is LLM-authored text landing in a message body.
Deleting the trailer, as this did, meant the user never learned the choices
existed. `max_buttons` stays `0` because no tappable widget is rendered. WeCom
keeps its own `_render_options_as_text` rather than the shared
`render_options_as_text` for one reason, and the contract test names it: WeCom
STREAMS, so an unterminated `[OPTIONS…` tail there really may be a marker
mid-flight and is hidden, where the buffer-and-send-once channels keep it as prose.
That difference is now expressed as `split_options_trailer(..., hide_partial=True)`
rather than as a second copy of the parse — only the folding into `format_overflow`
stays local.

### One parse of the `[OPTIONS:]` marker

`split_options_trailer(text, *, hide_partial=False) -> (body, choices)` is the
single parse. `render_options_as_text` returns only the body, so every
widget-capable renderer used to carry its own copy — six of them, three (Discord,
Telegram, Teams) identical down to the comment. A parse duplicated per channel
drifts per channel and does it silently, because each copy reads correctly alone.

`hide_partial` is the one thing the channels genuinely disagree about, so it is a
parameter rather than a baked-in policy:

- **`True` — a streaming surface** (Discord, Telegram, Teams, WeCom, and Webex's
  status frame). Text is still arriving, so an unfinished `[OPTIONS` fragment may
  be a marker mid-flight; hiding it keeps reserved protocol off the screen, and the
  next frame re-renders from the full buffer, so nothing is lost. Only a tail that
  can still become the trailer is held back — `[OPTIONS` as the final bytes, or
  `[OPTIONS:` with content still open. Any other byte after `[OPTIONS` is
  grammar-dead (the trailer opens `[OPTIONS:`), so the fragment is quoted prose
  and is kept: when no `]` ever arrives, the sealed frame re-trims too, so cutting
  it would be the permanent loss below wearing a streaming excuse.
- **`False` — a buffered surface that sends once** (Webex's final answer and the
  zero-widget path). Such a caller cannot tell a live fragment from prose, and
  cutting prose is permanent: a reply ending `see the [OPTIONS section` keeps its
  last four words.

The default is `False` because the failure directions are asymmetric — a needless
keep flashes markup for one frame, a needless cut deletes unrecoverable text — so a
caller that forgets degrades toward the cosmetic failure, and every streaming caller
states `True` explicitly, which also makes the destructive choice greppable.

**`slack/format.py::extract_options` is deliberately NOT converged.** It parses the
LINE grammar (`OPTIONS_RE_LINE` — `re.MULTILINE`, end-of-*line*), not the
end-of-buffer `OPTIONS_RE_TRAILER` every other channel uses, so routing it through
this helper would silently stop matching a marker that ends a line mid-message.
Different grammar, not a duplicate. `test_options_cap_contract.py::TestOnlyOneTrailerParseExists`
greps the tree for a re-derived parse and records both exemptions.

**Proactive push works, per-target.** `aibot_send_msg` needs no token and has no
expiry, but WeCom only delivers into a conversation the user has already written
to. So `supports_proactive_send` is `True` (the transport CAN push) while
availability is answered per target by `configured_targets()`: an allow-listed
userid that has never messaged the bot is listed with a reason rather than offered
and then failing at send time. Warmth is learned from AUTHORIZED inbound only, so
an unauthorized sender cannot make itself a mirror target.
`resolve_configured_target()` rechecks MEMBERSHIP at the side-effect boundary and
deliberately does not recheck warmth: `_warm_chats` is in-memory while a mirror
binding is persisted, so after a gateway restart warmth is UNKNOWN rather than
known-false, and refusing on it would silently disable every mirrored send until
the user happened to write again. Deliverability is WeCom's answer to give — the
push is attempted, the refusal arrives on the ACK that `send_proactive` waits for,
and `send_message` raises `WeComSendError`. Warmth stays where being wrong is
cheap: the availability hint in `configured_targets`. This is what makes `/link`, the dashboard mirror and cron
delivery reachable at all; the origin mirror is bound on every turn and withdrawn
only by `/unlink`, matching Telegram and Discord.

**Every out-of-band ack is a PUSH, and its one-shot fallback reports a verdict.**
`client.say` carries every command ack, notice and refusal. As a bare stream frame
its refusal was recorded against the stream and nothing acted on it — the user
pressed a command and got nothing back, which reads as the command not existing
rather than as a delivery failure. It now prefers `aibot_send_msg` (own `req_id`, so
acceptance is confirmed; the conversation is warm by construction because this only
runs on a turn the user just sent), falls back to a sealed stream frame for a
deployment where the push is unavailable, then to `response_url`.

`send_reply` returns whether the platform ACCEPTED it. The status and errcode were
always inspected and then discarded, which forced callers to guess — the renderer
treated "a `response_url` exists" as proof of delivery, so a failed POST looked
identical to a delivered one and a headless answer tail went out behind it. Its
refusal log carries the http status and a classification only: `errmsg` can echo the
rejected payload, which is the answer text.

**The empty/error seal is recovered like any other.** That branch carries the failure
notice, and `drive_turn` swallows a provider error — so if the frame is refused and
nothing recovers it, the user is told nothing at all about a turn that failed while
the inbound `msgid` stays deduped against WeCom's retry. Routing it through
`_send_final_chunk` is what keeps "the turn was answered" true, which is the premise
the dedupe window's correctness rests on.

**The threshold notice is a PUSH, not a stream frame.** It is sent post-turn,
between `on_done` and the renderer's `close()`, and `client.say` opens a fresh
stream on the SAME inbound `req_id` — the only key a cmd-less ACK carries, so the
client attributes an arriving ACK to the newest stream sent on that req_id. Sending
the notice there retargeted that attribution: a refusal ACK for the ANSWER's
sealing frame landed against the notice, leaving the answer looking accepted and
defeating the `close()` recovery in exactly the case it exists for. `send_proactive`
mints its own req_id, so it cannot collide, and its acceptance is confirmed rather
than assumed — the better guarantee for a message the user must actually see. The
conversation is warm by construction: this runs on a turn the user just sent.

**The per-turn origin bind is offloaded too.** `bind_origin_mirror` consults
`SessionManager.mirror_opt_out`, and that read WRITES — a refusal stored under an
older generation key is promoted to the bucket inside `batched_save`, whose block
exit rewrites the whole map inline on the calling thread. That runs on EVERY inbound
message, so on the loop a one-time migration stalls every other conversation and the
WS heartbeat behind a disk write. `set_origin_link` beside it deliberately stays on
the loop: it reaches `_save` unbatched, whose loop-aware branch schedules one
debounced flush that writes in a worker thread anyway.

**The link commands persist OFF the loop.** `SessionManager.set_mirror_opt_out`
opens `batched_save` internally (two flag writes, atomically) and
`release_conversation_location` opens one of its own (three clears, so the location
is never half-freed while the reply claims ✅). A batch block's exit writes the
whole map INLINE on the thread leaving the block, so on the event loop it is a
synchronous disk write on a map that grows with every session ever created —
stalling every gateway turn and the WS heartbeat. Both calls therefore go through
`asyncio.to_thread`, awaited in sequence so the refusal still lands before the
release. The unbatched mutations beside them (`set_mirror_link`,
`clear_mirror_link`, `set_origin_link`) stay on the loop deliberately:
`SessionMap._save`'s loop-aware branch marks the map dirty and schedules one
debounced flush that writes in a worker thread, and wrapping those in a batch would
reintroduce the inline write. Pinned by thread identity in
`test_wecom_commands_and_ingest.py`, because what makes the write safe is not being
on the loop.

**Inbound media is an encrypted CDN fetch with a PER-OBJECT key.** An
`aibot_msg_callback` never carries bytes: `image` / `file` / `video` carry a
~5-minute `url` plus their own `aeskey`, and the object is **AES-256-CBC**,
PKCS#7-padded to a 32-byte multiple, IV = the key's first 16 bytes. `wecom/media.py`
owns that protocol work and `wecom/attachments.py` maps each item onto the shared
`messaging/attachments.py` pipeline, so classification, limits, signature
validation and temp-file ownership stay channel-neutral. This is deliberately NOT
Weixin's scheme (AES-128-**ECB**, shared key) and the two must not be merged: the
mode, key length and key scope all differ. The `aeskey` arrives in two encodings
for the same value (base64 of raw bytes, base64 of ASCII hex), discriminated by
decoded length plus a strict hex check, because guessing wrong yields plausible
garbage rather than an error. It also arrives with its base64 `=` padding
**stripped** (a 32-byte key as 43 characters), so the padding is restored before
decoding — a strict decoder rejects the unpadded value as invalid base64 outright. The download cap is enforced on BYTES READ, never on
`Content-Length` — and it is the plaintext ceiling **plus the padding**, because
what is read is ciphertext: PKCS#7 to a 32-byte multiple always adds 1–32 bytes, so
a file at exactly WeCom's 20 MB maximum arrives larger than it is and a cap set to
the plaintext figure refused precisely the largest valid attachments, before
decryption. `WECOM_MAX_PLAINTEXT_BYTES` is exported from `wecom/media.py` and the
ingest limits take it from there, so the two cannot drift. The inbound `url` is platform-*supplied* but not
platform-*guaranteed*, so it is vetted through `link_unfurl.vet_unfurl_url` (https
only, port 443 only, and every resolved address checked) before any fetch — an
unvetted fetch is a server-side request forgery read primitive whose response flows
on into the attachment pipeline. **The fetch is then pinned to the address that vet
approved**: with no operator `proxy`, `download_media` opens its own one-request
session on the connector `link_unfurl.pinned_connector` builds, so the socket
goes where the vet looked and a second DNS answer has nowhere to land. The pin
serves every address the vet approved, so a multi-homed CDN host keeps the
node-to-node fallback it had before the pin — the same
mechanism `teams/client.py` and the link-preview handler use. No CDN host
allow-list is applied, deliberately: WeCom documents no stable media-host set, so a
list here would be a guess that silently drops real media, and the address vet
closes the same class without naming hosts. The rebinding residual remains on
exactly one path, a **configured proxy**, and by construction: aiohttp hands the
proxy the hostname and performs no local lookup, so a pin would be unconsulted, and
split-horizon DNS means our resolution may not even match the proxy's. A proxied
deployment should read the vet as a scheme-and-destination soundness check rather
than a guarantee about the egress path. `voice` is excluded from the download path
on purpose: WeCom returns its OWN transcript in `voice.content`, so the text is the payload and no
shipped backend decodes the codec — which is also why `WECOM_INGEST_LIMITS`
budgets audio at the 20 MB **file** ceiling and not at WeCom's 2 MB voice-message
limit: no voice bytes ever reach the ingest path, so the only audio that does is a
file the user attached, and the voice limit would have refused a 5 MB `.mp3` that
WeCom itself carried. `max_text_bytes` is the one cap left at the shared default
on purpose — it budgets bytes READ into gateway memory, of which only
`max_text_inject` can reach the prompt, so it is not a transport ceiling and must
not be raised to one. A `mixed` message's caption lives in its item
list rather than in `text`, and is read from there — and a media-only message is a
message, so the empty-text early return now also requires no attachments.

**Deliberately not implemented here**, and each a platform capability we do not
use yet rather than a limit: interactive `template_card` buttons and their
`template_card_event` callbacks (which is why `max_buttons` stays `0` — doc
`/101032` says the interactive card types require a configured callback URL, which
is in tension with long-connection mode, and declaring a widget capability that
cannot be verified against a live bot is the exact dishonesty
`test_capability_ledger.py` exists to prevent); per-group sessions;
and the `enter_chat` / `feedback_event` events. `_handle_event` recognizes those
event types and drops them deliberately: each owes a reply inside a 5-second
single-delivery window, so answering one is a feature with its own design.

**Outbound media send DOES ship** (the 3-step chunked `aibot_upload_media_init/chunk/finish`
handshake in `wecom/media_upload.py` + `client.upload_media`, then a
`send_file_proactive` `aibot_send_msg` frame): a `file_send` to a WeCom peer
delivers the file as native WeCom media — a `.png`/`.jpg`/`.jpeg` as an image, an
`.mp4`/`.webm` as video, everything else as a generic `file` — routed by
`upload_destination.DOCUMENT_CHANNELS` + the `send_document` verb, and a non-empty
caption follows as a companion text push. The extension→type map is deliberately
narrow: a format maps to a richer type only when WeCom's own `type` accepts it AND
`security.BINARY_MIME_ALLOWLIST` admits it at the upload gate. A gif/bmp/webp is
allowlisted but WeCom's image type is JPG/PNG only, so it sends as an ordinary
`file`; an image that exceeds the image type's tighter 2 MB cap but fits the
20 MB `file` cap is likewise downgraded to `file` rather than failed. Voice is
unmapped because `audio/amr` is not allowlisted at all — the upload gate refuses it
with HTTP 400 `binary_mime_not_allowed` before `send_document` runs, so an `.amr`
never sends (as voice or as file). `files_outbound` nonetheless stays
`False`, because that flag gates a DIFFERENT thing: whether a renderer extracts a
local image reference out of a sealed reply segment and uploads it inline. WeCom
ships no such renderer-extraction path, so an inline image reference in a reply
keeps printing its path — the honest degradation — and declaring the flag `True`
would make the capability ledger claim an extraction WeCom does not do while
changing nothing about the `send_document` path, which never reads it.

The frame shapes (`aibot_upload_media_init/chunk/finish`, the `msgtype` media
frames, the 512 KiB/100-chunk caps) are implemented from WeCom's published aibot
API and exercised against a WS stand-in; a live-bot round trip for each media type
is not reachable from CI and remains to be confirmed by a maintainer against the
published protocol (or by a live send). Until then a wrong frame assumption would
make a `file_send` fall back to the dashboard-link path rather than corrupt
anything — the same degradation as before this change, not a new failure mode.

**Size is capped PER TYPE, from WeCom's published limits** (message-push config,
`developer.work.weixin.qq.com/document/path/91770`): an `image` and a `voice` note
are each capped at 2 MB, a `file` and a `video` at 20 MB, and every object must
exceed the platform's 5-byte floor. `media_upload.MAX_BYTES_BY_TYPE` is the one
place those live; `prepare_upload` enforces `min(caller-ceiling, type-cap)`, so an
oversize image or voice note is refused before the handshake starts rather than
accepted locally and rejected by the platform mid-upload. This replaces the
earlier single 20 MiB ceiling that every type shared.

## WeCom settings API

- `GET /api/wecom/config` — the shared bot-channel shape with TWO credential
  slots: the panel's primary secret (`bot_token_set`/`bot_token_preview`)
  maps to `WECOM_SECRET`, and a second slot (`bot_id_set`/`bot_id_preview`)
  maps to `WECOM_BOT_ID`. `connected` is LIVE truth kept by the client's
  status callback: `maybe_start_wecom` wires `WeComClient.on_status` into
  dashboard state BEFORE opening the WS (so the first transition cannot be
  missed), and the reconnect loop reports transitions — healthy once a
  connection is up + subscribed; not-healthy with a reason on connect
  failure, an immediate server close (bad credentials), or a server kick.
  This callback is the compensating control for skipping save-time
  credential verification: bad credentials surface on the badge within
  seconds of the gateway starting, not silently never. `connect_error`
  carries that reason, `configured` requires both credentials AND
  enabled AND (a non-empty allow-list OR `allow_all_users`). `allowed_user_ids`
  projects the
  canonical `wecom.allowed_users` `{userid, name}` entries down to userid
  strings for the tag editor. `allow_all_users` is the explicit
  allow-everyone opt-in (default false) — it is a deliberate toggle, never
  inferred from an empty allow-list, and the transport still denies frames
  without a userid under it. Never returns a raw secret.
- `PUT /api/wecom/config` — requires a direct-local request (loopback peer
  AND no forwarding headers); remote gets 403. Validate-first/commit-last.
  Each credential slot has independent set/clear fields (`bot_token`/
  `bot_token_clear`, `bot_id`/`bot_id_clear`; clear flags must be strict
  booleans, an accidental `WECOM_*=` env-line paste is stripped, inner
  whitespace rejected). There is no pre-store verification: validating WeCom
  credentials needs the AI-bot WebSocket long-connection (no cheap REST
  "whoami"), so `verify_warning` is always empty; the live on_status
  badge (above) surfaces bad credentials within seconds of the channel
  starting. `allowed_user_ids`
  entries must match the WeCom userid shape (1-64 chars of
  letters/digits/`.-_@`, fail closed); the save re-attaches stored display
  names to surviving entries and writes the canonical `{userid, name}` list
  back to `config.json` under `wecom`. `allow_all_users` must be a strict
  boolean. Secrets land in `config_dir/.env`
  (atomic 0600) with `os.environ` synced. Writes are serialized under the
  repo-wide config lock. Every config field applies live —
  `WeComTransport.reconfigure` replaces `allowed_users` and `allow_all_users`, the
  reset windows and thresholds are read per turn, and an `enabled` or `ws_url`
  change reconnects the WeCom channel alone — so `restart_required` is
  true only for a `.env` credential write.

## Microsoft Teams channel

**Transport (`kiro_crew/teams/`).** A concrete `MessagingTransport` over a
pure-`aiohttp` Bot Framework client (`client.py`) plus `PyJWT` for inbound token
validation — no Bot Framework SDK dependency (the optional `kirocrew[teams]`
extra). Teams is the **only** channel whose inbound is a public HTTPS endpoint:
every other channel opens an outbound connection, but "Teams sends a JSON object
to your agent's messaging endpoint, and it allows only one endpoint for
messaging." There is no Socket Mode equivalent, so this is a permanent
architectural divergence, not a gap to close.

**Inbound authenticity is the channel's whole trust boundary.** `on_activity`
extracts the `Authorization: Bearer` token and runs `JwtValidator.verify` off-loop
(`asyncio.to_thread` — a JWKS fetch and an RS256 verify must never sit on the
gateway loop) BEFORE the activity is ACTED ON, returning 401 with a SEL
`denied_invalid_token` row. The route reads and JSON-parses the body first, under
`TEAMS_MAX_ACTIVITY_BYTES`, because that is what bounds it; the guarantee is
"nothing is dispatched pre-auth", not "nothing is read pre-auth". `verify` pins `algorithms=["RS256"]`, sets
`audience` to the bot's App ID, requires `exp`/`iss`/`aud`, allows the
documented five-minute clock skew, and rejects any issuer outside
`{"https://api.botframework.com"}`. `_require_https` pins the scheme of both the
OpenID metadata URL and the resolved `jwks_uri`, closing an arbitrary-file-read
vector (`PyJWKClient` would honour `file://`). `_dispatch_activity` then binds the
outbound target to the token's own `serviceurl` claim: the reply carries an
app-credential bearer token, so a replayed activity pointing `serviceUrl` at an
attacker-controlled host must not receive it.

`_dispatch_activity` also binds the channel POSITIVELY: `activity.channelId` must
equal `msteams`. An Azure Bot resource has Web Chat enabled by default and can
carry Direct Line, and both reach this endpoint with a token that passes every
check above — same issuer, same audience, matching `serviceurl` claim — while
defaulting `conversationType` to `personal`. On Direct Line the CLIENT composes the
`from` object, so `aadObjectId` is not channel-attested and `teams.allowed_emails`
would be matching an identity the sender chose. A negative test ("not some other
channel") would fail open on the next channel Microsoft adds.

Five bounds sit around that check, because this is the one route reachable from
the internet:

- **Route reachability.** `csrf_middleware` applies an Origin check to every
  non-safe method, and the Connector sends neither `Origin` nor `Referer`, so the
  request is refused before the JWT handler runs unless the peer happens to be
  loopback. The route is therefore in the **method-scoped CSRF exemption for
  self-authenticating external webhooks** — sound because CSRF defends against a
  browser attaching cookies cross-origin, and this handler ignores cookies and
  authenticates a JWT a browser cannot forge. Only `POST` is exempt; `PUT`/`DELETE`
  on the same literal path still match dashboard-authed wildcard routes.
- **Failed-auth throttle**, reusing `webhooks.py`'s existing counters, so an
  anonymous flood cannot spend one SEL row per request. Note its SCOPE: the
  throttle is skipped for a proxied request (`is_proxied_request`) because it would
  otherwise key every caller onto the proxy, and two of the three documented
  topologies are proxied. So it is NOT what bounds the JWKS refetch.
- **JWKS refetch damper.** `PyJWKClient.get_signing_key` answers an unknown `kid`
  with an unconditional `refresh=True` fetch and has no rate limit of its own, so
  each bogus-kid POST would buy one outbound HTTPS GET. `JwtValidator._get_signing_key`
  therefore does the kid lookup itself — cached set first, then at most one
  refetch per `_JWKS_REFRESH_MIN_INTERVAL_SECS` — so the damper sits next to the
  fetch it bounds rather than at a route that may not run. A genuinely rotated key
  is still reachable within one interval.
- **Bounded body.** The dashboard route reads the activity under
  `TEAMS_MAX_ACTIVITY_BYTES` and stashes the parsed dict under
  `TEAMS_ACTIVITY_REQUEST_KEY`, so `on_activity` never re-parses an unbounded
  body. The cap lives in the route, keeping `client.py` free of dashboard imports.
  The route passes `require_json_content_type=False`, and that is what keeps the
  sentence above true rather than a relaxation of this perimeter:
  `read_bounded_json`'s 415 returns before a byte is read, the route forwards only
  a 413 (a verdict from body CONTENT must not precede the JWT check), so a live
  gate here would drop the 415, skip the stash, and hand `on_activity`'s bare
  `request.json()` fallback an untouched stream bounded only by the app-wide
  `client_max_size`. Whether to REFUSE a non-JSON media type from the Connector is
  a separate decision about an external contract; today the route accepts it, and
  caps it.
- **Replay drop and an in-flight ceiling.** The Connector legitimately redelivers
  when the bot misses its ack window, so a duplicate `activity.id` is dropped
  idempotently (audited `denied_replayed_activity`) rather than refused — checked
  AFTER attestation so an unattested activity cannot consume a dedupe slot. A
  valid-token burst is shed past `_MAX_INFLIGHT_TURNS`, since each turn holds a
  session semaphore and a provider process. Two shapes are EXEMPT, and must be,
  because both are how a saturated gateway gets UNstuck: a card click (Teams
  delivers `Action.Submit` as an ordinary `message` activity, so shedding it drops
  the Approve/Deny press that would free a slot and deadlocks every waiting prompt)
  and `/stop`, whose aliases are DERIVED from `COMMAND_SPEC` rather than copied.
  Neither starts a turn, so neither costs a semaphore.

The handler fast-acks 200 and runs the turn in a background task: the Connector
times out the inbound POST at ~15 seconds, far below an agentic turn.

**Outbound.** `POST/PUT {serviceUrl}/v3/conversations/{id}/activities[/{activityId}]`
with a cached client-credentials token (`login.microsoftonline.com`, scope
`https://api.botframework.com/.default`; the tenant is templated so single-tenant
works). Delivery failure **raises** `TeamsSendError` rather than returning `None`:
every caller treats a return as proof of delivery, so a swallowed error made the
gateway record an answer the user never received. Callers that legitimately
tolerate failure — the typing indicator, a cosmetic in-place edit, a command
acknowledgement — catch it at their own call site. Retries cover Teams' documented
transient set, which is **wider than the usual 429-only rule**: `412`, `429`, `502`
and `504`, honouring `Retry-After` and otherwise backing off exponentially. The
status badge is bidirectional — a delivered activity clears a stale failure, and
`_notify_state` dedupes on the transition so a healthy channel does not republish
per send nor overwrite the first failure reason. Before the request is made,
`_fit_activity` measures the whole serialized activity (text plus JSON envelope,
`ensure_ascii=False`) against `TEAMS_MAX_ACTIVITY_TEXT_BYTES` and tail-truncates
the text to fit — mirroring Webex and WeCom's wire-side `truncate_utf8` guards —
so an over-budget activity delivers its head instead of dying as a Connector 413.

**serviceUrl durability (`service_urls.py`).** The Bot Framework offers no way to
look up where a conversation can be reached: `serviceUrl` arrives on an inbound
activity and the bot must remember it. An in-memory map lost every proactive
destination on restart, so a cron result or dashboard mirror leg had nowhere to
send until the user spoke again. `ServiceUrlStore` persists
`conversation_id -> serviceUrl` (plus the allow-listed identity that owns each
conversation, recorded only AFTER authorization) to
`$KIROCREW_HOME/routing/teams_service_urls.json`. Loading is lazy and off-loop —
never on the gateway boot path — every failure degrades to the in-memory map because
a lost routing hint must not stop delivery, a non-Connector row does not survive a
reload, and the map is bounded by count with least-recently-seen eviction.

It lives in its own `routing/` directory because that directory is a keystone leaf,
so the agent can neither read nor write it: the identity map is what an explicit
`user:<upn>` send target resolves through, and a writable copy delivers one person's
cron result to another. The DIRECTORY is registered rather than the file, so
`atomic_write`'s `mkstemp` temp sibling is covered too — see
[security](security.md#crew-data-home-secrets--governance-trust-root) for why that
distinction is load-bearing. There is no migration from the pre-`routing/` path:
reading the old, agent-writable location would reopen the hole.

Two paths besides an ordinary message keep that map honest, one per direction:

- **Learning without a prompt.** A personal-scope `conversationUpdate`
  (membersAdded) or an `installationUpdate` carries the whole routable tuple —
  conversation id, `serviceUrl`, `aadObjectId` — under exactly the attestation
  above and no prompt, so `TeamsClient.on_route` hands it to
  `TeamsTransport.note_route`, which re-applies the SAME personal-scope and
  allow-list gates `receive` does. A freshly installed app is therefore a proactive
  target before the user first types, without a Connector conversation-creation
  round trip; a join from a channel or a stranger records nothing, so "reachable"
  never comes to mean something other than "authorized".
- **Forgetting a dead route.** Capacity eviction is not enough: once a user blocks
  the bot or removes the app the route is permanently undeliverable, and keeping it
  turns every later cron result and mirror leg into a red badge with nothing able to
  clear it. `TeamsSendError` carries the Connector's `status`, and
  `TeamsTransport.send_message` calls `ServiceUrlStore.forget` on a PERMANENT
  refusal only (`403`/`404` — not `401`, our credential, and not `429`/`5xx`, which
  are transient), dropping the identity row with the conversation and persisting it
  so the next process does not re-advertise it.

**Security model.** `authorize` is deny-by-default against
`teams.allowed_emails` (matching the UPN/email when Teams supplies one, else the
AAD object id, since activities carry that more reliably); an empty allow-list
authorizes nobody. `TeamsTransport.reconfigure` adopts a reloaded roster and
updates all THREE copies from one applier — the transport's own set, the
dispatcher's, and `TeamsSessionResume`, whose `owner_id` is re-derived — because a
roster that lives in three places and is refreshed in one is a roster with two
stale copies. **Personal-scope only, fail closed:** any non-`personal`
conversation type is denied and audited BEFORE authorization, because a reply in a
channel or group chat would expose tool output to members who are not on the
allow-list. `MICROSOFT_APP_ID` / `MICROSOFT_APP_PASSWORD` /
`MICROSOFT_APP_TENANT_ID` are on the sandbox agent env denylist, and
`pod/runtime.py` forces `teams.enabled = false` in a sanitized seed and scrubs the
`MICROSOFT_APP_` prefix — a pod that inherited a real config would otherwise drive
the operator's production bot and answer real people.

**Dispatch + rendering.** Turns ride the shared `TurnDriver` through
`messaging/dispatch.py::drive_turn`. The command vocabulary lives in ONE table,
`teams/commands.py::COMMAND_SPEC`, which drives both the parser and the `/help`
card so the two cannot drift: `/new`, `/compact`, `/stop` (alias `/cancel`),
`/yolo`, `/link`, `/unlink`, `/sessions`, `/dashboard`, `/help`, plus the `/queue` and `/steer` per-message
directives. A bare directive answers with usage rather than handing the
literal `/queue` to the model, which would reply to it as chat text.
`/dashboard [<N>h|<N>m]` MINTS a presigned dashboard login token for the asking
identity (default and cap from `commands.parse_dashboard_ttl`) and is SEL-audited,
so every address on `teams.allowed_emails` can issue itself a dashboard session —
the same premise that scopes `/yolo` to one conversation.

**`/sessions` continues a dashboard chat here** (`teams/session_resume.py`), on the
same shared core Discord uses. What Teams supplies is the widget — an Adaptive Card
whose `Action.Submit` returns as an ordinary message activity, so it needs no `invoke`
handler — plus its own display redaction and command spellings. Three properties are
Teams-specific and load-bearing:

- **Owner-only, and STRICTER than Discord's rule.** Discord requires exactly one
  configured user id. Teams' allow-list routinely holds several people, and a dashboard
  session is the operator's whole working transcript, so listing is refused unless
  `teams.allowed_emails` holds exactly one identity. With more than one it refuses
  everybody rather than picking the first entry — the same premise that scopes nothing
  else on that list to one person.
- **The submit carries an INDEX, never a session key.** A key in the payload would be an
  instruction to bind whatever the sender named; an index is resolved against the list
  this process actually offered, so a forged or replayed press can only ever miss. The
  registry additionally scopes on the owner and on the posting the press came from.
- **Routing runs BEFORE the command intercept.** `/compact` and `/stop` act on the
  RESOLVED session, so after a binding was destroyed they would compact or cancel the
  native Teams session while the user believes they drive the resumed one. Deciding once,
  upstream, makes that structural instead of something each handler must remember; the
  decision is then threaded into the turn and never re-resolved. `/sessions`, `/new`,
  `/unlink` and `/help` stay reachable while routing refuses, because a user whose link
  broke needs the way back in. A resumed turn does NOT rotate its generation — rotation
  belongs to this conversation, and applying it would move the user off the transcript
  they just attached to. `/new` and `/unlink` release the binding, and a release that
  cannot be made durable changes nothing and says so.
- **A refusal that did not land settles nothing.** Settlement clears (or adopts) the
  durable record the refusal was owed for, so applying it after an undelivered notice
  routes the user's NEXT message into a transcript they were never told about. Both
  channels gate on delivery: Discord on `send_message`'s own boolean, Teams on `_reply`'s
  (which is why that helper returns one at all — a cosmetic command ack is still logged
  and swallowed, but a notice that gates durable state is not cosmetic). An unsettled
  record owes the same refusal again, which is the direction that fails safe.
- **A card click resolves against BOTH keys of its conversation.** The turn registers
  its decider and its renderer under the key it ran with, which for a resumed
  conversation is the bound `dashboard:` one — so `_handle_card_action` keyed only off
  the native `teams:{email}` session would find neither, tell the user the prompt is
  stale, and let the tool deny by default at the prompt timeout. It tries
  `_click_session_keys` (resumed, then native) in order. Both, not just the resolved
  one, because a card click is a relief activity that bypasses the busy check: a
  `/sessions` pick can bind the conversation while an earlier turn is still in flight,
  and that turn's cards stay registered under the key it started with. Both keys belong
  to the same conversation and identity, so this widens nothing — at most one of them
  holds a given `(request_id, nonce)` pair, and the per-prompt nonce still decides.

**Which identity the allow-list authorizes.** A Teams activity may carry a UPN, an
AAD object id, or both, and `teams.allowed_emails` accepts either form. So
`TeamsTransport._resolve_identity` picks the form the list actually AUTHORIZES rather
than a fixed preference order: a plain email-first rule denies a user whose OBJECT ID
is allow-listed whenever Teams also sends an email — the ordinary shape for a guest
account and for any tenant that lists object ids — with the entry sitting right there
in the list. When both forms match, the email wins, so an install listing both keeps
the human-readable session key it already had. An unauthorized sender falls back to
email-then-object-id so the deny audit names them recognisably.

The decision is then CARRIED, on `TeamsInbound.resolved_identity`, and read in exactly
ONE place per module: `TeamsTransport._resolve_identity` makes it,
`TeamsDispatcher._identity` reads it. Every re-derivation is a chance to disagree, and
each one that existed did: the transport admitted a user on their object id while the
dispatcher keyed the session on their UPN (a session nobody authorized, which owner-only
`/sessions` then refuses), and `handle_message` keyed a turn on the UPN while
`_handle_card_action` keyed the click on the object id (so the approval card resolved
against a session nothing was awaiting, expired, and the tool denied by default — and
`/new` rotated a generation the turn was not using). `_identity` falls back to
email-then-object-id for an inbound built outside `receive` (tests, and the route-only
activities that never reach a turn), which is the same answer whenever only one form is
present.

**The credential check verifies outside the config lock and CONFIRMS inside it.** The
save-time Azure token exchange is a network round trip, and `_get_config_lock()`
serializes every config writer in the process — holding it across that call would stall
unrelated saves, and a hung endpoint would wedge them until the timeout. So the check runs
first, records the exact `(app_id, password, tenant)` Azure accepted, and the commit path
re-derives that triple under the lock and refuses (`config_changed`) if it moved. Without
the confirmation, two concurrent saves — one changing the app id, one the secret — each
verify a triple containing the other's old value, both pass, and the serialized commits
merge into a stored triple neither one checked: a green "Saved." and a channel that is
dead at the next restart. Optimistic concurrency, not a longer lock.

**A quote-reply is unwrapped before anything reads the text.** Right-click → Reply
in a 1:1 chat — the only scope this channel serves — makes Teams PREPEND the quoted
message to `activity.text`, while the user's own words sit in the `text/html` body
attachment after a `<blockquote itemtype="http://schema.skype.com/Reply">`.
`attachments.quoted_reply_text` recovers them, and the client prefers that over
`activity.text`. Without it a quote-replied `/stop` no longer starts with `/`, so it
reaches the model as prose and the turn keeps running, and a quote-replied question
arrives with the previous message jammed onto the front. The helper returns `""` for
any shape it does not recognise, so an unfamiliar client degrades to `activity.text`
rather than losing the message, and the body attachment is still never ingested as a
FILE (that would duplicate the prompt).

**Tool approval is an Adaptive Card** (`teams/cards.py`, `teams/approvals.py`).
Teams renders no Block Kit and no message components, but an `Action.Submit` on a
card returns as an ORDINARY `message` activity whose `value` carries the button's
payload — which is why `Action.Submit` is used and `Action.Execute` is not: a
universal action arrives as an `invoke` needing a synchronous
`{statusCode, type, value}` body, incompatible with the fast-ack-then-background
shape the Connector's inbound timeout forces. The card offers Approve / Trust
session / Deny, mirroring Slack's three, and `[OPTIONS:]` choices ride the same
mechanism as chips through the shared `apply_options_cap` (`max_buttons=5` — BELOW
Slack's 10, because Adaptive Card actions render as full-width buttons on mobile —
and overflow degrades to a numbered text list rather than vanishing).

**A chip is turn content, never a command.** The chip re-dispatch passes
`interpret_commands=False`, exactly as the queue drain does, and that is a security
boundary rather than a nicety: a label comes from the MODEL's own `[OPTIONS:]`
trailer and display redaction does not strip a leading `/`, so with interpretation
on a model that emitted `[OPTIONS: /dashboard | cancel]` would render a chip whose
single tap mints a dashboard login credential.

Two properties make a click safe, and both are the reason this is not a bare dict
of futures:

- **A stale card cannot answer a live prompt.** ACP request ids restart at 1 in
  every provider process, so a card still sitting in a chat from a previous run
  can name an id that is live again for a DIFFERENT tool. Every prompt mints a
  nonce, compared on resolve; the registry key is namespaced by session because
  two sessions can await id `1` at once. A timeout, an unknown id, a mismatched
  nonce and an already-answered prompt all resolve to "not approved".
- **The payload carries no authority.** A submit is client input, so it is only
  ever a LOOKUP key into state this process holds. An option chip's label is read
  from what that turn actually offered, never from the payload, so a forged label
  cannot be injected as if the user had typed it.

An answered prompt's card is REPLACED with its outcome (`resolved_card`, no
actions), so a chat never accumulates live buttons that resolve to nothing; a
click that resolves nothing tells the user, because a button that silently does
nothing is indistinguishable from a broken bot. Three cases reach that same
replacement, because "answered" is not the only way a prompt stops being live:

- **Expiry.** The decider calls `on_expired` (wired to the renderer, which is the
  only thing that knows where the card is) when the click window closes, so the
  buttons do not keep looking live forever.
- **A card that never landed.** The nonce is armed BEFORE the post so a fast click
  is not refused as stale, which means a failed post leaves an armed prompt with no
  control. `TeamsApprovalDecider.abandon` denies it AT ONCE and the renderer says
  so, instead of parking the turn for the full window behind a card nobody received.
  A delivered card whose activity id Teams merely WITHHELD is not this case; both
  read as an empty string, and `_card_posted` is what separates them.
- **A turn that ended before the decider.** `arm` reserves the future as well as
  the nonce, and `__call__` adopts it, because `TurnDriver` dispatches
  `PROMPT_CHOICE` and only then awaits the decider: a click landing across the card
  post resolves the reservation and `__call__` returns that decision without
  waiting, where minting the future in `__call__` would discard it, report an
  approval that already expired, and deny when the window elapsed. `arm` never
  replaces a live future and is inert off the event loop, where no waiter can exist.
  A reservation no wait adopted is dropped by `discard_reservations()` in the
  dispatch's per-turn `finally`, and by `__call__`'s own abandoned-card return;
  both drop every reservation whatever state its future is in: a decision no wait
  adopted has no reader, and retaining it leaves the nonce live for a card still in
  the channel.
- **A chip pick.** `settle_options` replaces the chips card with the choice before
  the turn runs, so no other chip still looks live and the transcript records which
  one was picked. If the chips card could not be posted at all the choices degrade
  to a numbered text list — the trailer was already cut from the body, so silence
  would lose them — and the nonce is dropped so no later press resolves against a
  card that does not exist.

**The typing indicator is kept alive.** A Teams typing activity expires after a few
seconds, so one at turn start leaves a minutes-long turn showing dots briefly and
then a silent chat, which a user cannot distinguish from a dead bot. The renderer
refreshes it every `_TYPING_REFRESH_S` until the turn finalizes (~1% of Teams'
7 requests/second per-thread budget); the progress bubble only covers a turn that
CALLS a tool, so a long pure generation or a `/compact` has nothing else to show.
Both `on_done` and `close` cancel the loop, because an orphaned refresh would post
into a finished conversation for the process lifetime.

`ChannelTurn.auto_approve_session` is the second rung, letting a user stop being
asked per tool. Teams passes `() -> safety_override().is_active()` — the ONE
process-wide grant, and nothing else. The field is an **additive** widening of the
shared pipeline (`None` default, and `TurnDriver` already accepted the parameter),
so a channel that does not set it keeps deny-by-default byte for byte.

Both ways a Teams user can arm that grant go through the SAME shared helper:
`/yolo` calls `messaging.commands.run_yolo_command`, and the card's middle button
calls it with `"on"`. So the duration, the expiry, the renewal grammar and the SEL
row are identical whichever way the user asked, and neither can disagree with the
dashboard toggle. Teams deliberately keeps **no grant store of its own** — a
channel-local trusted set would be a second grant with its own lifetime and its own
answer to "is YOLO on?", and it would have had to reimplement expiry, renewal and
auditing that the shared helper already owns. `approvals.TeamsApprovalDecider` only
RECORDS that the button was pressed (`trusted`), because arming is async and audited
while the click path is sync; the dispatcher arms it, before settling the card, so
the label cannot claim a grant that failed to arm. The grant does not weaken the
PreToolUse gate: the sensitive-path keystone, the governance ceiling and the
deny-list all run ahead of the auto-approve ladder, so a hard DENY still wins.

The renderer lazily opens ONE progress
message on the first tool call and edits it in place (throttled — Teams' limit is
7 requests/second per thread), and at `on_done` reuses that message for the first
chunk of the answer so no "Working…" bubble is stranded above the reply. Splitting
goes through the shared fence-safe `split_markdown_safe` off-loop, not blind
fixed-width slicing, so a long reply cannot be cut through the middle of a code
fence. The delivered text is re-scanned in its **display** form
(`messaging/display_safety.py::redact_for_display`) at that single chokepoint,
because stripping the trailer and letting Teams render markdown can reassemble a
credential the driver's scan saw as broken. Messages carry
`textFormat: "markdown"`; note Teams renders only a markdown SUBSET in a plain
message (bold, italic, preformatted, blockquote, links — **not** headings, lists,
tables or images), which is the largest remaining content-fidelity gap versus
Slack mrkdwn.

`on_thinking` is a no-op, matching every non-Slack channel.

### Teams' file halves (`teams/attachments.py`)

Both capability flags are `True`, and both are deliberately narrower than the
platform. `teams/attachments.py` owns only what is Teams-shaped; classification,
limits, signature validation, temp-file ownership, reference scanning, the
security floor and the byte budgets all stay in `messaging/attachments.py` and
`messaging/outbound_files.py`.

**Outbound: inline images only, and that is a scope decision, not a gap.** An
`Attachment` whose `contentUrl` is a `data:image/png;base64,…` URI renders with no
hosting and no round trip, which covers the case this exists for — an
agent-produced chart. A NON-image file would need the `FileConsentCard` flow:
a consent card (`application/vnd.microsoft.teams.card.file.consent`), a user
accept, a `fileConsent/invoke` activity carrying `uploadInfo.uploadUrl`, a `PUT`
of the bytes with `Content-Range`, then a `…card.file.info` confirmation — plus
`supportsFiles: true` in the app manifest. Be precise about the blocker: that
`invoke` needs no synchronous body of its own (unlike `Action.Execute`, which does —
see the card section), so the fast-ack ingress is not what rules it out. What rules
it out is SCOPE: five new wire shapes, a per-upload state machine keyed on a consent
the user may never give, and a chunked `PUT` — for a case an inline raster already
covers. A non-inlinable reference is refused visibly instead, and this paragraph is
the record of the decision rather than of an impossibility.

- **The seal is `on_done`, and it is the only one.** Teams does not stream, so
  there are no live frames that could flash markup before the seal replaces it and
  no length rotation that could bisect a reference — the two hazards Discord's
  `hide_local_refs` and upload-eligibility flag exist to handle. Extraction runs
  once per turn through `extract_local_refs_off_loop`, gated behind a `"!["`
  substring pre-check so an ordinary answer never touches the filesystem.
- **Named ceilings fed in as budgets.** `TEAMS_MAX_INLINE_IMAGE_BYTES` (1 MiB,
  Teams' documented picture limit), `TEAMS_MAX_INLINE_IMAGES` (4 — each image is
  its own activity against a 7-requests/second-per-thread limit) and
  `TEAMS_MAX_INLINE_TOTAL_BYTES` become one `ExtractLimits`, so an oversize image
  is refused *by the read* and keeps its markdown. Base64 inflation costs nothing
  here: Teams' ~100 KB activity-payload budget explicitly EXCLUDES a base64 image,
  so the picture limit is the only bound that binds.
- **One activity per image, sent after the text.** Teams SPLITS an activity
  carrying both text and an attachment and withholds its id, and its own guidance
  is to send separate activities rather than depend on that split.
- **The format allow-list is `{image/png, image/jpeg}`** — narrower than the
  neutral sniffer. Teams documents PNG/JPEG/GIF but states animated GIF does not
  render, and whether a GIF is animated is not decidable from leading bytes, so
  accepting the format would mean sometimes sending the one shape Teams refuses.
  WebP and BMP are not in its documented set. Pixel dimensions (Teams caps a
  picture at 1024×1024) are deliberately NOT pre-checked: it would mean decoding a
  header per format and would refuse an ordinary 1200-pixel-wide chart.
- **Every refusal is returned and audited, and no picture disappears in silence.**
  A neutral-module refusal (sensitive path, symlink, not-a-raster, over the per-file
  ceiling) keeps its original markdown, so the path stays visible. Two Teams-owned
  refusals cannot: `teams_inline_unsupported` (a real raster Teams will not inline)
  and `teams_inline_undelivered` (an activity that failed) are only knowable AFTER
  the read, by which point extraction has cut the markup — so those name the
  **resolved path** in their refusal line instead, keeping the same property by a
  different route. This is the one documented deviation from the neutral contract's
  "keeps its original markup". That line is therefore the ONLY surviving trace of the
  picture, so it is never budget-dropped: `_append_rejections` does not check
  `max_message_chars`, because every caller chunks and an over-cap body costs one
  extra message rather than a lost line. The undelivered-image follow-up is chunked
  for the same reason — a refusal quotes an LLM-authored path, so it has no bound of
  its own. Refusal lines are appended BEFORE display redaction, so a destination
  quoted in one is scanned like the rest of the answer.
- **The attachment NAME is a display sink too, and both its sources are untrusted.**
  `inline_image_name` prefers the (already redacted) alt text and falls back to the
  path's basename — which the model also wrote. `_SAFE_NAME_RE` preserves
  `[A-Za-z0-9._-]`, every character an `AKIA…` key id or a `ghp_…` token needs, and
  extraction has already cut the path out of the body, so for an empty caption this
  name is the only remaining sink. Both the SOURCE and the finished name are scanned
  and any hit collapses the whole name to `image.<ext>`; scanning the source too is
  not belt-and-braces, because the 64-char cut can slice a token down to a prefix the
  scanner no longer matches.
- **The approved root, and the one gate.** Extraction needs the provider's real
  `cwd`. `authorize_upload_root(root)` is the public setter a caller holding the
  live provider uses (same contract as Discord's renderer); absent that, the
  renderer resolves the SAME value lazily and off-loop from the session map's
  persisted per-session `cwd`, which is recorded from `provider.cwd` at session
  creation. It fails closed on every uncertain case — no row, a relative path, an
  unreadable map — because an unknown root means there is no boundary to check a
  reference against. Teams needs no analogue of Discord's restricted-session
  ceiling (a personal chat is already a 1:1 boundary gated by `allowed_emails`),
  but a `dashboard:`-namespaced key is refused anyway: a dashboard slot can be
  incognito and the renderer cannot resolve that signal. Audits carry counts and
  closed reason codes only, never the destination or a file name.

**Inbound needs `supportsFiles: true` in the MANIFEST.** Microsoft states plainly
that without it the file features do not work, and "receive files in personal chat"
is one of them — so an operator who skips it gets a bot that never sees a PDF, Word
document or text file, with no error and no refusal line, while pasted inline images
keep working (they arrive as an image `contentUrl`, not a
`file.download.info` attachment). The shipped guide lists it as a REQUIRED step for
that reason. Microsoft also does not support Teams file send/receive in GCC High,
DoD or 21Vianet.

**Ingest runs in the DISPATCHER, not the transport**, and the placement is
load-bearing rather than tidiness. It sits after the governance gate, after the
command intercept and after the busy check, so: nothing is fetched for a message
that ends up QUEUED (a mid-turn arrival may wait minutes), and the temp files are
unlinked by the same frame that awaits the turn reading them. Downloading at arrival
and unlinking in that frame left the drained turn a prompt naming a file that no
longer existed — `acp/prompt_blocks.py` skips a path that is not a file, so the model
received a bare `/tmp` path and answered about nothing, silently. Two rules follow
from the same place: an attachment-bearing message is never STEERED (a steer carries
text only, so the files would be dropped while the user is told they were folded in)
and never read as a COMMAND (Teams puts the caption in `text`, so "/stop here is the
log" would cancel the turn AND discard the file). The queue entry carries the RAW
descriptors and the drained turn re-ingests them, bounded by
`IngestLimits().max_attachments` so a burst is answered across turns instead of
having its surplus refused. Discord and Telegram draw every one of these lines in
the same place.

**Inbound: two kinds with OPPOSITE auth.** `TeamsInbound.attachments` carries
`activity.attachments` raw, and nothing is fetched until the personal-scope gate,
the identity resolution and the allow-list check have all passed in
`transport.receive` — the dispatcher, one layer in, is only reached after them, so an
unauthorized sender or a group conversation can never make the gateway fetch
anything. A file-only activity (attachments, no text) survives the empty-activity
guard, or the whole message would be discarded. Temp paths are owned by the frame
that awaits the turn and unlinked in a worker once it returns.

- **A personal-chat upload** arrives as
  `application/vnd.microsoft.teams.file.download.info`, whose `content.downloadUrl`
  Microsoft documents as a URL the reader "can issue an `HTTP GET` directly from"
  (the underlying Graph `@microsoft.graph.downloadUrl` says "Authentication isn't
  required with this URL" and is short-lived). It is fetched with **no credential,
  ever** — the Connector token is credential-equivalent and that host is not
  guaranteed to be one Microsoft operates.
- **An inline image** arrives with a `contentUrl`, and here Microsoft contradicts
  itself: the current page says the SDK handles authentication and its samples send
  no header, while the previous revision of the same page and the shipped sample
  attach the bot's Connector token. The host is not documented at all. So the
  decision fails closed on the host: the token is offered only to a recognized Bot
  Framework host (`_TOKEN_HOSTS_EXACT` / `_TOKEN_HOST_SUFFIXES`, dot-anchored so a
  lookalike cannot satisfy the match), and the anonymous fetch is tried as well, in
  that order. Both orders are documented as correct somewhere; trying both costs
  one extra request on a 401.
- **Bounds, in two halves.** `_vet_download_url` is the NAME check: https, no
  non-443 port, no IP literal, and not the loopback/link-local name space — with the
  FQDN root dot stripped first, because `localhost.` is the same host to every
  resolver and a blocklist comparing the raw name refuses one spelling while admitting
  the other. `_vet_resolved_address` is the second half, and it is the one a name
  blocklist cannot do: any public name an attacker controls can point at `127.0.0.1`
  or `169.254.169.254`, and a nip.io-style wildcard needs no control of a zone at all.
  It resolves through the single `resolve_addresses` seam (off-loop; also the one
  place a test can supply a record) and refuses if ANY answer is private, loopback,
  link-local, reserved, multicast or unspecified — stricter than "the one we would
  connect to", because the ordering aiohttp picks is not ours to predict. Resolution
  failure refuses too. It matters that this is a READ primitive, not a blind one: the
  body is written to a temp file and a text/document body is injected into the prompt,
  so the model would summarize an internal endpoint back into the chat.

  **The socket dials the address that was vetted.** Checking a NAME cannot close DNS
  rebinding: aiohttp resolves the URL host itself, so a pre-fetch vet and the connect are
  two lookups, and the second — microseconds before the socket opens — can answer
  `169.254.169.254`. So the vet RETURNS what it approved and the fetch pins it, and
  attachment fetches use their own `ClientSession` whose `TCPConnector` resolves through
  `_VettedResolver`: it serves pinned answers and refuses to resolve anything else, so
  there is no second lookup to poison and a code path reaching that session without
  vetting cannot fetch at all. aiohttp still sees the original URL, so TLS SNI and the
  `Host` header carry the real hostname — connecting by IP instead would break
  certificate validation. The pin map is bounded (`_PINNED_HOSTS_MAX`); an evicted entry
  costs a fresh lookup, never a weaker check, because the next fetch vets before it pins.
  The Connector session deliberately does NOT share this resolver: its hosts are gated by
  `connector_host_allowed`, a different and stricter rule, and routing them through a pin
  map would make an outbound activity depend on a download's state.

  Both halves run on EVERY redirect hop — at most three, followed MANUALLY so the
  credential decision is retaken for the host that actually serves the bytes — and
  `TEAMS_MAX_DOWNLOAD_BYTES` is enforced on bytes actually READ so a lying
  `Content-Length` cannot smuggle an unbounded body. Every write goes through a
  worker thread.
- **What is not a file.** Teams echoes rich text as a `text/html` attachment on
  ordinary messages, and a card can ride an activity; both are skipped without a
  note, because a per-message line would be pure noise. Any other unrecognized
  content type is reported by TYPE — not by file name — and never fetched.

`test/test_teams_attachments.py` pins the policy half (envelope mapping, the auth
flag per kind, the budgets, name sanitization, the refusal codes);
`test/test_teams_files.py` pins the wire half (the credential decision, URL
vetting, the read ceiling, the seal, and the inbound gate ordering).

## iMessage channel

**Transport (`kiro_crew/imessage/`).** A concrete `MessagingTransport` over the
external `imsg` CLI (MIT, macOS 14+) in its long-lived `rpc` mode: the gateway
spawns it as a child and speaks newline-framed JSON-RPC 2.0 over the child's
stdin/stdout, the same shape as a language server. No daemon, no port, no
webhook, and therefore **no new inbound network surface**; the child exits
cleanly when stdin closes, so the existing subprocess lifecycle applies
unchanged. `rpc.py` owns only the framing (request correlation, notification
routing, oversized/unparseable-line tolerance, a stdout limit far above
asyncio's 64 KiB default so one large line cannot kill the reader);
`client.py` owns iMessage semantics. "Unparseable" is any line that is not a
JSON object, undecodable bytes and a line nested past the JSON decoder's ceiling
included: each is dropped with one warning, except a blank line, which is
dropped silently. A read that fails with any `OSError`
(a reset, an `EIO`) ends the loop like EOF does, so its teardown — failing the
pending calls, reporting the disconnect — always runs.

**Why an external bridge rather than Python.** iMessage has no server-side API,
so both halves a channel needs are macOS-native problems: following the Messages
SQLite database and its WAL through filesystem events (with a poll backstop,
because macOS drops events and rotates sidecar files) and dispatching a send
through Messages.app. A reimplementation would be a second, worse copy of a
moving target, and would put database-corruption and TCC-permission handling
inside the gateway process. The dependency is one binary the operator installs
with a package manager, and its absence is detectable and reportable at startup.

**Local-only is the design constraint, not a preference.** Hosted relays exist
that will hand you an iMessage-capable number and let any Linux host drive it
over an API. That is explicitly rejected: it puts a third party in the message
path of the one channel whose entire value is that the transport is the user's
own device and their own account.

**Inbound.** `watch.subscribe` on the all-chat stream with a `since_rowid`
cursor persisted to `$KIROCREW_HOME/imessage_cursor.json`, so a gateway restart
replays what it missed instead of losing it. The cursor advances on every
observed row, including ones the channel drops — a cursor that tracked only
delivered messages would replay every skipped row on the next start. Two
behaviours of the subscription are handled explicitly rather than discovered in
production:

- The subscription is **bounded** (`buffer_limit`, default 256). When it fills
  it ENDS, with one terminal `watch.overflow` notification carrying
  `resume_after_rowid`; the client resubscribes at that cursor with capped
  exponential backoff. Ignoring this makes the channel go permanently silent
  under a burst rather than lose one message.
- That cursor is at or before the first dropped message, so **duplicate replay
  is possible by design**. A bounded dedupe window keyed on message GUID
  (`DEDUPE_WINDOW = 1024`, deliberately larger than the buffer) is therefore
  required, not optional.

**Outbound.** `send` with a `to` handle. The result's `id`/`guid` are
best-effort in the bridge's own contract, so their absence is treated as success
with no id, never as failure.

**Typing and read receipts.** `typing` and `read` are documented exceptions to
the bridge's injected-helper requirement (typing keeps a direct-IMCore fallback,
read keeps bridge activation), so they work on a default install with
`bridge.ready = false`. Availability is probed from the `initialize`/`status`
readiness snapshot's `methods` field — the structurally usable surface at that
instant — and each degrades silently and permanently on first rejection, because
their parameter lists are not part of the bridge's documented surface. This
matters because iMessage cannot edit a sent message, so the typing indicator is
the only progress signal the channel has.

**Capabilities.** `streaming=False` and `edit=False` (no message mutation
exists), `reactions=False`, `files_inbound=False`, `files_outbound=False`,
`threads=False`, `max_buttons=0` (no tappable choices — a trailing `[OPTIONS:]`
trailer becomes a numbered list through the shared `render_options_as_text`, the
same as WeCom, Weixin and Feishu; WhatsApp is the button-less channel that strips
it instead),
`supports_proactive_send=True` (a Mac may message a handle at any time; there is
no 24-hour window), `supports_session_resume=False` (inbound routes off the
handle, not a mirrored session binding). `max_message_chars=4000` is declared
conservatively rather than measured: iMessage publishes no maximum, and this
field is a claim other code trusts, so under-declaring costs an extra message
while over-declaring risks a send the platform silently refuses.

**Access control.** Handle allowlist, deny-by-default — an empty allowlist
authorizes nobody, which is the correct posture for a channel with no org
boundary in front of it. Handles are normalized before comparison (email folds
to lowercase, phone loses formatting) so `+61 400 000 000` and `+61400000000`
are one handle. **Group chats fail closed** with a
`denied_group_chat` audit: a reply there would deliver tool output to members who
are not on the allowlist, the same reasoning that makes Telegram and Webex
direct-only. Unauthorized inbound is dropped with no reply, so an unknown sender
learns nothing about what they reached.

**Own-message suppression is TWO signals, and the gate order is load-bearing.**
Neither part is a defensive extra: a self-chat loop that answered its own replies
without bound shipped once (issue #5246), and each rule below is what closes it.

1. `is_from_me` drops the rows the bridge already attributes to the agent, without
   an audit event — the all-chat watch sees its own replies, and auditing them
   would log one entry per outbound message.
2. That flag is not sufficient on its own. In a **self-chat** the allow-listed
   handle IS the identity the agent sends as, and the bridge writes the
   attribution asynchronously (`watch.subscribe` defaults to a 500ms debounce
   expressly so an `is_from_me` correction can land), so an echo can arrive
   looking exactly like user input. The client therefore keeps a short-lived
   **ledger of what it sent** — one record per sent message, holding both the
   body it went out with and the guid the bridge reported, consumed whole on a
   match — and the transport consults it as the LAST gate before dispatch.

The ordering constraints are the part a refactor must preserve:

* The ledger check runs **after** the `is_from_me` drop, so a copy the platform
  already attributes to the agent cannot consume the record that the
  *unattributed* echo needs.
* It runs **after** the group and allowlist gates, because consuming is a side
  effect: a row that will be dropped anyway must not spend the record on its way
  out.
* A record's TTL starts when the send **resolves**, not when it is issued, and an
  unresolved record is never pruned or evicted — the echo of a slow send arrives
  before its result does.

Reordering any of those reintroduces the loop. The accepted cost is a bounded
one: an allow-listed sender who repeats the agent's exact text within the TTL has
that message suppressed once, in any chat rather than only a self-chat.

**Rendering.** Only the final answer is delivered; reasoning and tool activity
stay in the gateway. There is no placeholder message, because there is no edit
to rewrite it with — every other channel's "🤔 Thinking…" would be stranded
above the reply permanently. Markdown is flattened (`plaintext.py`) before
sending, with **fenced code-block contents passed through verbatim**: code is
what a user copies out of a message, and unwrapping or re-indenting it corrupts
it silently. Splitting runs last, on already-flat text, preferring a paragraph
break, then a line break, then a space, then a hard cut that still respects
grapheme clusters (a cut inside a flag, a skin-toned emoji, or a combining
accent renders as mojibake on both sides). CJK text, having no spaces, always
reaches the hard-cut path.

**Topology: v1 requires the gateway to run ON the Messages host,** and refuses
to start elsewhere. A gateway running remotely could point `cli_path` at a
transparent stdio wrapper and would appear to work — it can read chats and
process inbound — while outbound sends fail with an AppleEvents authorization
error (`-1743`), because the Automation grant is recorded against the
remote-shell server process, which macOS exposes no grantable toggle for.
Shipping that topology would mean shipping a send path that cannot be made to
work, so the channel refuses and reports why.

**Host requirements.** macOS 14+ with Messages signed in; Full Disk Access for
the process context that reads the Messages database; Automation permission for
Messages.app for sends. Both grants are per process context, so a headless
launch-agent gateway needs its own one-time interactive grant.

**Deliberately out of scope for v1.** Group chats, attachments in either
direction, SMS-only operation, and every message mutation (tapbacks, edit,
unsend, effects, polls, group management). Those last ones require injecting a
helper into Messages.app, which requires System Integrity Protection to be
disabled system-wide. **v1 must not require SIP changes** — asking a user to
disable SIP to talk to their own agent is not an acceptable default.

**Pod isolation.** `pod/runtime.py` forces `imessage.enabled = false` in a
sanitized seed. iMessage is the one channel with no credential to scrub, so a
pod that inherited `enabled: true` from a real config would drive the operator's
actual Messages.app and reply to real people.

## iMessage settings API

- `GET /api/imessage/config` — `connected` (true only while the bridge's watch
  is live this session, kept truthful by `IMessageClient.on_state_change`),
  `connect_error`, `configured` (enabled AND a non-empty allowlist — the
  transport fails closed on an empty list), `supported` (false off macOS, so the
  UI can explain the requirement instead of leaving the operator to infer it
  from a channel that never connects), `read_only` (true unless the request is
  direct-local), plus `enabled`, `cli_path`, `db_path`, `allowed_handles`,
  `service` and `session_folder`. **There is no credential in this payload** —
  no mask, no presence boolean, nothing to rotate.
- `PUT /api/imessage/config` — requires a direct-local request (loopback peer
  AND no forwarding headers); remote gets 403. Validate-first/commit-last.
  `allowed_handles` accepts an Apple Account email or a phone-shaped handle
  (linear string checks, no regex, so an operator-supplied list cannot trigger
  polynomial backtracking). `service` must be one of `imessage` / `sms` /
  `auto`, sharing one `IMESSAGE_SERVICES` constant with the loader's clamp so
  the form's choices and the config normalization cannot drift. `cli_path` and
  `db_path` reject line breaks and NULs: they become `argv` of a spawned child
  (via `create_subprocess_exec`, never a shell), where a newline would corrupt
  the argument rather than be quoted. Writes go to `config.json` under
  `imessage`, serialized under the repo-wide config lock. Every field applies
  live, so `restart_required` is false for this channel: `allowed_handles` is
  replaced by `IMessageTransport.reconfigure` (an EMPTY list IS adopted — empty is
  this transport's deny-all, not an unreadable value), the thresholds and
  `session_folder` are read at the point of use, and a `db_path`, `cli_path`,
  `service` or `enabled` change restarts the iMessage bridge alone.

## WhatsApp channel

A QR-linked **personal** account, paired as a linked device over the WhatsApp Web
protocol (`neonize`, an optional extra installed with `kirocrew[whatsapp]`). There
is no bot identity and no Business account, so the agent sends **as the
operator**, which is what makes the two invariants below load-bearing rather
than tidy.

Because it is the personal Web protocol and not the Business Cloud API, figures
quoted for the Cloud API do not transfer in either direction: there are no
interactive reply buttons at all, and there is no 24-hour customer-service
window.

**Echo discipline** (`whatsapp/echo.py`). Every message the account sends comes
back on the event stream with `from_me=True`, byte-identical in shape whether the
operator typed it or this channel sent it. Content matching cannot separate them
(the operator may quote the agent; a prefix marker leaks into the conversation),
so the channel tracks the **message ID of every send** and drops an inbound
`from_me` event whose ID it remembers. A `from_me` message it does NOT remember is
the operator typing, which is the self-chat command surface. Reads are
non-consuming because WhatsApp redelivers after a reconnect, and a one-shot pop
would let the redelivery through as a phantom operator command.

**The session store is on the sensitive keystone.** `<data home>/whatsapp/` holds
whatsmeow's device keys, which are the entire credential: anything that reads them
can act as the operator on WhatsApp with no second factor. It is a
`_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES` entry, classified as the DIRECTORY so the SQLite WAL and SHM
sidecars are covered too, and the path is pinned to the default: `whatsapp.db_path`
is inert, because the protection is a path match and an operator-supplied location
would carry the credential out from behind it.

**Identity is folded at the edge** (`whatsapp/transport.py::_canonical_sender`).
Multi-device addresses a sender either by their phone number or by a Linked
Identity (`<id>@lid`), and the two user parts are UNRELATED strings. Operator
config is written in phone numbers, so an `@lid` sender is resolved to its phone
JID once per sender (`client.phone_for_lid`, cached) before anything compares it
to the allowlist. Without that fold, `dm_policy="allowlist"` silently ignores a
person the operator explicitly allowed: it fails closed, which is the safe
direction, but presents as the channel being broken. An unresolvable alias keeps
the `@lid` form and therefore stays denied.

**Capabilities.** `streaming=True`, `edit=True`, `reactions=True`,
`files_inbound=True`, `files_outbound=True`, `rich_blocks=False`,
`threads=False`, `max_message_chars` reads `renderer.WHATSAPP_CHUNK_LIMIT`,
`max_buttons=0`, `supports_proactive_send=True` (no 24-hour window, so reminders
and cron results deliver at any time), `supports_session_resume=False` (inbound
derives its key from the chat JID and never resolves a dashboard mirror binding,
so a dashboard connect is outbound-only).

`max_buttons=0` here also means the choices are LOST, not degraded: this renderer
strips a complete `[OPTIONS:]` trailer (`turn_renderer._strip_options`) rather than
routing it through `render_options_as_text` like the other four zero-widget
channels, so a question whose choices live only in the trailer reaches the user
without them. A tool approval is unaffected (`on_prompt_choice` builds its own
numbered prompt). That half is a gap rather than a position, and
`test_options_cap_contract.py` cannot see it: WhatsApp is absent from its
`_all_channel_capabilities()` map, so the exhaustiveness ratchet judges nine
channels in a ten-channel repo.

Declaring no widget at all is a conservative CHOICE, recorded as unverified rather
than as a platform ceiling. The pinned wheel ships a complete interactive-message builder
(`neonize/ext/interactive_message/`, `send_interactive_message`) and a poll builder
(`build_poll_vote_creation` / `decrypt_poll_vote`); what nothing in this repo could
establish is whether a recipient's client RENDERS a native-flow message sent from a
personal linked device rather than a Business account. Writing it down as
impossible would close the door on every future picker on this channel.

**Configuring a group admits the agent to the room, not the room to the agent.**
The group gate (step 4) decides whether the agent may SPEAK in a group: is it
configured, is the agent addressed, has the cooldown elapsed. Step 5 then applies
the per-sender allowlist to the message, the same check every other channel makes
on group traffic: the linked account always passes, any other member must appear
in `allowed_wa_ids`, and an empty list admits nobody but the operator
(`WhatsAppTransport._group_sender_admitted`). It runs for an @-mention, a reply to
the agent and a rules-mode unprompted message alike, so an unlisted member cannot
drive a turn of any kind on the operator's host; the drop is silent and SEL-audited
(`whatsapp_transport.authorize_group`, outcome `denied`, source `whatsapp`), and
an UNCONFIGURED group is still dropped at step 4 before any audit row. The check
deliberately does not consult `dm_policy`: `open` means anyone may DM the agent,
not that anyone in a configured group may drive it, and reading it here would hand
the room back. Group turns from an admitted non-operator remain answer-only
(`deny_all_tools`, no steering, minimal context), because being allowed to talk to
the agent is still not being allowed to act as it.

**Group media asks the same question again at the fetch.** `_may_fetch_media`
requires the same individual admission for group media (the linked account, or a
listed number) even though step 5 already did, because the fetch is the one point
where bytes land on the host and it must stay closed to any future caller that
reaches it without passing the gauntlet: in `rules` mode an unaddressed message
already answers `respond=True`, and the per-group cooldown does not bound the fetch
because it only starts once a reply actually delivered, which a sentinel-silenced
turn never does. A refusal is spoken through the same note path an unsupported
type uses, since silence reads as the agent ignoring a photo the sender believes
it received.

**Streaming is by edit, throttled.** The Web protocol exposes an edit where the
Business Cloud API does not, so the renderer sends the first bubble once there is
something worth reading and then edits it, opening a new one when the text
outgrows a message or the 20-minute edit window closes. Two bounds exist for the
operator's phone number rather than for looks: edits are coalesced to at most one
per `_EDIT_INTERVAL_S`, single-flight, keeping only the newest pending text (each
edit is a full end-to-end encrypted send to every device of every participant, and
neonize's own example edits once per character); and past the window the server
refuses, so the bubble seals instead of silently dropping progress. An unprompted
group turn never streams, because it may still choose silence and a streamed
prefix cannot be unsent.

**Media.** Inbound images, stickers, voice notes, audio and documents go through
`whatsapp/media.py` (which decides what arrived, from the protobuf alone) and
`whatsapp/attachments.py` (which fetches the bytes into the shared ingest path).
Presence is probed with `HasField`, never truthiness: a protobuf's singular
submessage is never `None`, so reading an absent one returns a default instance
and truthiness reports every field present. Content that cannot be ingested (a
location, a poll, a contact card) produces a visible note rather than silence.
Outbound, `whatsapp/files.py` runs the shared extractor at the seal and uploads
each raster from BYTES, never by re-opening the path, because every security gate
was applied to one inode. Its ceilings are this repo's policy, not sourced
platform figures.

**An inbound name is the sender's CLAIM, and the ingest layer reads it.** The
shared layer picks a document parser and a transcription decoder from the
filename's extension, so `whatsapp/attachments.py` appends a mimetype-derived
suffix only when the name carries none. A document is the one kind that arrives
with a filename at all, and a declared type is only a claim: a PDF sent as
`application/octet-stream` derives `.bin`, and appending that turns `report.pdf`
into `report.pdf.bin`, which matches no parser, so the file is refused before it
is ever downloaded. The pinned `_SUFFIX_OVERRIDES` entries outrank the name as
well, for the reason they exist: an `audio/ogg` attachment the sender named
`note.oga` reaches the same suffix the transcription backend does not recognise.
`MAX_MEDIA_BYTES` is enforced twice, against two different values, because
neither alone is enough. The pinned binding returns the whole decrypted object in
one value (it exposes no streaming and no size-limited download), so the ONLY
bound that can act before the allocation is the sender's DECLARED `fileLength`,
and the only bound that can be trusted is the length of what actually arrived.
The pre-fetch check therefore refuses an oversized declaration, refuses one that
would not fit in `host_available_mib()` with headroom (a 0 reading means "could
not determine" and allows the fetch, never "no memory"), and refuses a media
message that declares NO length at all: every media protobuf carries the field
and `describe` reads it for every kind, so an absent one is not a legitimate
shape, and it is precisely the input that makes the shared layer's
`att.size and att.size > cap` pre-check skip itself. The post-fetch check is what
keeps an UNDERSTATED object off the disk and out of the prompt. What remains, and
is a binding limitation rather than a policy choice, is that an admitted sender
who understates the length still causes one transient allocation bounded by
WhatsApp's own server-side media cap. The write to the shared temp path is
offloaded because `TMPDIR` is not guaranteed to be local disk.

**Outbound media protobufs are assembled by the channel, not by neonize's `send_*`
helpers.** `send_image_bytes`, `send_voice_bytes` and `send_document_bytes` each
build their own `Message` and go out through one `send_message`, for the same
reason `send_text` passes an explicit `Message(conversation=...)`:
`build_image_message` and `build_document_message` run neonize's mention parser
over the CAPTION and put the result in `contextInfo.mentionedJID`, so an
`@<digits>` run in agent-authored alt text would be delivered as a real mention of
that number and would notify its owner in a group. The captions carry an empty
`ContextInfo` instead. The image build also decoded and rescaled the whole raster
inline to make the inline preview; that decode runs through `asyncio.to_thread`,
and the media type is declared per upload so neonize never probes the bytes with
libmagic on the loop. `build_audio_message` is avoided for a different reason: it
shells out to `ffprobe` for the duration, which would make an FFmpeg install a hard
requirement for sending a voice note, so `AudioMessage.seconds` comes from the
caller or from a stdlib WAV header read and degrades to an unlabelled duration. A
voice note is `PTT=True`, which is what makes the recipient's client draw a player
rather than a file attachment; the container is the caller's to choose, and
WhatsApp's own voice notes are `audio/ogg; codecs=opus`, so a client may decline to
play push-to-talk audio in another format. A document travels under the BASENAME of
its path only, because WhatsApp shows the recipient whatever `fileName` carries.

**Access control.** `dm_policy` is deny-by-default with four values: `self`
(the default; only the linked account's own messages), `allowlist`, `open`, and
`disabled`. An unrecognized value denies everyone. Groups are invisible
unless configured per group, then gated by mode, mention and cooldown
(`whatsapp/group_gate.py`), and within a configured group each sender is judged
by the `allowed_wa_ids` allowlist (operator always; empty list admits nobody
else) whatever `dm_policy` says. `WhatsAppTransport.reconfigure` adopts all three on a
config reload: `dm_policy` (an unrecognized string is adopted, because
`_dm_policy` denies what it does not recognize), `allowed_wa_ids`, and `groups`
re-coerced through the loader's `_coerce_whatsapp_groups`. The `GroupGate` is
rebuilt only when the coerced rules actually differ, because rebuilding it resets
the unprompted-reply cooldown clock.

**A stale group entry is reported once, at the first connect.** Groups are opt-in
and matched by exact JID, so an entry the account cannot resolve (a hand-typed
JID, or a group the account has since left) is INVISIBLE rather than broken: the
gate drops every message from a JID it does not hold, and silence is
indistinguishable from nobody writing. On the first transition to `connected` the
channel diffs the configured JIDs against `client.list_groups()` and logs ONE
aggregated warning naming the unmatched ones. Three properties are load-bearing.
It hangs off the CONNECTED state callback rather than off `connect()`, because
`connect()` returns once the attempt is merely underway, so a diff taken there
sees no joined groups and would name every configured group on every boot. It is
scheduled as a task rather than awaited, so the round trip never lands inside the
sequence that starts the remaining channels. And it compares exact strings, the
same key `GroupGate` indexes its entries by, because a normalizing compare would
call a case or `:device` typo fine and leave the group mute. An empty
`list_groups()` answer produces no warning at all: that value means both "the
account is in no groups" and "the `get_joined_groups` call failed", so it cannot
tell a stale JID from a probe that never ran, and naming every configured group on
a transient API failure is what teaches an operator to ignore the line.

Proactive targets are gated by MEMBERSHIP, not just by shape.
`resolve_configured_target` reads `_proactive_targets()`, the same linked-account
plus DM-allowlist pair `configured_targets` lists from, so what the dashboard
offers and what it accepts cannot drift. That resolver is the only allowlist check
on the mirror-link path, which round-trips a chosen id back through it, and
`dm_policy` never sees that path: accepting any well-formed `user:<number>` would
let a proactive send open a conversation with an arbitrary phone number.

**Acting as the agent is narrower than talking to it.** `is_operator` admits only
the linked account,
independent of `dm_policy`: `open` admits a stranger to CHAT and a configured
group admits its members, but neither may authorize a command on the operator's
machine. It reads the operator verdict `receive` already reached from the full
multi-device picture rather than re-deriving it from the bare user part left on
`InboundMessage`. With `max_buttons=0` the prompt is the numbered text form from
`messaging/approval.py`, answered by typing `1`, `2` or `3`; silence denies. A
reply is consumed only while a request is actually open for that session, so
`no` is an ordinary message at every other moment, and only a reply that is
ENTIRELY a verdict counts, so `no, use the other file` reaches the model.

**A `from_me` message is not automatically a command.** It means the ACCOUNT sent
it, which includes the operator texting an ordinary contact from their phone, so
operator authority in a DIRECT chat requires the SELF-chat: that is the command
surface. Answering an outgoing message to a contact would put the agent into the
operator's private conversation and reply in that contact's chat. A configured
group is exempt, because that is where the operator does address the agent, gated
by mention or rules.

**A non-operator never shares the operator's unified session.**
`messaging.dm_scope="unified"` collapses every direct DM into one
`unified:{agent}` bucket, which is right for the operator (their WhatsApp and
dashboard conversations are the same conversation) and wrong for anyone else,
because that bucket carries the operator's history: an admitted peer could ask
what was discussed earlier and be told. A non-operator always gets a per-peer
bucket whatever the global setting says.

A non-operator's turn additionally carries `ChannelTurn.deny_all_tools`, because
setting the approval mode is not enough: the PreToolUse hook can answer
`auto_approve` and a session carrying Trust short-circuits, both ahead of the
interactive ladder. Nor is a permission request guaranteed to exist: a tool the
operator's agent spec names in `allowedTools` runs on the kiro backend without
asking, so a refusal that lives only on the permission event never sees it. The
shared pipeline therefore drives a `deny_all_tools` turn on
`dispatch.TOOLLESS_TURN_AGENT` (`kirocrew-guest`, `tools: []`, no MCP servers, its own conversational prompt; a spec separate from the background `kirocrew-lite` so that helper may grow a tool without handing it to a guest):
the backend mounts nothing, so there is no tool to auto-approve, and the driver's
refusal of any permission request that does arrive is the second line. The
acquisition passes `crew_agent=""` (the explicit "no crew" answer of
`resolve_crew_identity`) so the name resolves to the template itself: a crew
enrolled under that name would otherwise be made canonical by the crew-namespace
fallback and start its tooled spec under a binding that reads as tool-less. It
also passes an explicit `cwd`, the session's own work directory under the
workspace root (`_toolless_turn_work_dir`), so the acquisition is a cold start
there and never a warm-pool claim: a pooled process was spawned in the operator's
project cwd, where a project-local spec of the same name would shadow the
generated one. The spec is the enforcement, so it holds only where the spec is
what the harness mounts:
`drive_turn` reads the provider's backend and refuses the turn unless
`routing_for(backend)` is `Routing.AGENT_SPEC` (kiro, kas). A harness that reads
no agent spec keeps its own native tools, and one a project has pre-approved
raises no permission request, so on such a backend an untrusted sender gets no
turn at all rather than a tooled one (positive identity per harness-parity, never
"not claude"). A refused turn is not silent: the sender reads
`TOOLLESS_TURN_REFUSAL_NOTE`, one neutral line with no internals, and the SEL row
(`turn_agent` denied) carries the reason for the operator. An UNPROMPTED turn
(`ChannelTurn.unprompted`, a rules-mode group message nobody addressed to the
agent) is refused silently instead: the note would be an unsolicited post and
would start the unprompted cooldown for a turn that never ran. An unreadable backend
id (`None`, never `""`, which is the kiro id) refuses the same way. **Backwards
compatibility:** on claude, codex, opencode, pi, goose and deepseek a
non-operator who was answered before is refused after this change. WhatsApp
names that at startup through the shared `dispatch.warn_if_toolless_turns_unservable`
(the channel supplies only its admission facts; WhatsApp's caller is
`gateway._warn_if_non_operator_turns_unservable`, reading
`dm_policy` normalized as the transport does, an unknown value admitting nobody):
when a group is configured with a non-empty `allowed_wa_ids`, or `dm_policy` is
`open`, or `allowlist` with numbers, on a backend for which
`dispatch.toolless_turns_supported` is False, one warning states that every
non-operator turn will be refused and how to narrow admission; and when a group
is configured with an empty `allowed_wa_ids`, one warning states that only the
linked account is answered there and how to admit members. That is
why a non-operator's session key is built under that agent (`_session_key`), in a
DM and in a group alike: `get_or_create` keeps an existing session's agent, so a
key shared with the operator's tooled session would either hand the sender those
tools or (the pipeline reads the binding back) refuse the turn. In a group the
operator's shared session stays the operator's; an admitted member gets a
per-group bucket of their own (`GUEST_SCOPE_SEGMENT`), minimal-context like every
group turn. The two buckets share the scope's generation counter, so `_seed_gen`
seeds from the max over both, and back-pressure is keyed on the conversation: a
sender whose own bucket is idle still gets the busy receipt (`BUSY_NOTE`) while the
other bucket streams into the group, and never steers it; the operator's `/stop`
and `/compact` act on whichever bucket is live (`_live_session_key`); a refused tool-less turn (`ToollessTurnUnavailable`)
is a configuration answer and is not charged to the session's circuit breaker. They may talk to the agent; they cannot make it act. Steering
is gated the same way, since it injects text into a turn already running, which
under a unified DM scope is the operator's.

**Private context is withheld per SESSION, not per sender.** `minimal_context` is
`group or not is_operator`, and the `group` half is the one that is easy to get
wrong: a group's session key IS the group, so one session serves every member.
Keying the decision on who typed the current message leaks one turn later, because
the operator addressing the agent in that group injects their memory, lessons and
skills into the shared session and ACP replays native history, so a member's own
minimal-context turn can still be answered out of it. A group turn is therefore
minimal for EVERYONE, the operator included. The cost is deliberate: the self-chat
and DMs are where context-rich work belongs, and anything the agent says in a group
is visible to the group regardless.

It also carries `ChannelTurn.minimal_context`, and that is a SEPARATE control
rather than a duplicate of the two above. Both of those govern what the turn may
DO; this one governs what the turn is TOLD. The context builder assembles memory,
lessons, skills and history into the prompt before the model runs and before any
tool is requested, so a peer admitted only to chat would otherwise be answered
out of the operator's private material, with no tool call and no approval prompt
anywhere on the path to notice.

**The generation counter is seeded from disk** (`ConversationState(seed_fn=…)` →
`link.seed_generation`), like every sibling channel's. It is in-memory, so an
unseeded counter restarts at 0 after a gateway restart and the next `/new`
advances 0 → 1 straight back onto the `:gen1` still persisted, resuming the
conversation the operator explicitly discarded. The seed must address the same
bucket `_session_key` builds, so the chat type is re-derived from the JID (a group
keeps its full forum bucket whatever `dm_scope` says). It uses the OPERATOR's
`dm_scope` because `seed_fn` receives a scope with no sender attached, and the two
readings fail in opposite directions: reading the operator's bucket for a peer's
scope over-seeds, which merely skips generations and still yields a fresh session,
while reading a per-peer bucket for the operator under `dm_scope="unified"` reads
a bucket their conversation does not live in, answers 0, and puts the
resurrection straight back.

The same predicate gates COMMANDS, which is not interchangeable with the group
steer verdict: a DM carries no verdict, so the steer gate alone answers yes for
any admitted sender, and with `messaging.dm_scope = "unified"` every direct DM
shares one `unified:{agent}` bucket. Under `dm_policy` `allowlist` or `open` a
peer's `/new` would therefore bump the generation on the conversation the
operator is using.

**A group cooldown follows delivery, not the renderer's own bookkeeping.** A
muted conversation never runs this renderer: `drive_turn` substitutes
`SilentRenderer` into its LOCAL name, so `on_done` is called on that object and
the channel renderer's `suppressed` flag stays False. Recording the cooldown on
`not suppressed` therefore consumed it for a reply nobody received, silencing the
next unprompted turn that had something to say. The renderer sets `delivered`
only after a send returns, which also covers a send that raised.

**Phase reactions report the OUTCOME, and that is not the complement of
`delivered`.** With `max_buttons=0` a reaction on the operator's own inbound
message is the channel's only at-a-glance progress marker, so the dispatcher
draws the hourglass before the turn and the tick or the warning sign after it.
The success test is `delivered and not failed`, never `delivered` alone: a failed
turn still SENDS something, the apology notice, so `delivered` is True there too
and reading it by itself stamps a failure with the success tick. Only the renderer
sees the stop reason, so it records `failed` in `on_done`; the dispatcher cannot
re-derive it from what reached the chat. `_react` is the single chokepoint and
carries both suppressions: an unprompted group turn (a reaction is still a visible
mark in a conversation the agent was not addressed in) and a muted conversation
(`SilentRenderer` means these flags describe nothing that was sent, and a mute the
operator asked for must not answer back with a warning sign).

**Rendering.** `to_whatsapp_text` converts Markdown into WhatsApp's dialect
(`*bold*`, `_italic_`, `~strike~`, one code marker and no info strings) and
`render_chunks` splits with the shared `split_markdown_safe`. Fence grammar comes
from `messaging/split.py::iter_fence_lines` rather than a channel-local backtick
counter, which got three things wrong that reached the user: a four-backtick
block was not recognized as code so Markdown inside it was rewritten, a `~~~`
fence was not recognized at all, and hard-splitting a long block left chunks
carrying an odd number of delimiters, which WhatsApp renders as a monospace block
that never closes. Every rewrite runs BEFORE splitting so the splitter measures
what is delivered, which is what lets a step GROW the text: a flattened table row
carries its column labels, a diagram gains a heading, and a redacted credential
becomes a marker longer than the key. Splitting is awaited off the loop, as
Discord does. The full order is
`strip_ansi -> screen -> reduce -> convert -> screen -> split`.

**The reductions live in `messaging/markup.py`, and they emit Markdown.** This is
the most mobile surface in the product, so a construct that needs a monospace grid
or an image is unreadable here rather than merely plain, and the dialect drops
every info string. Three are reduced: a `<thinking>` block (no chat platform folds
one away, so the model's scratchpad is otherwise part of the answer), a pipe table
(flattened to one labelled bullet per row, the shape Slack adopted for mobile
readability), and a `mermaid` fence (flattened to arrows under a `*Diagram*`
heading, or kept as source under that same heading when the grammar is not one the
reduction reads). Each emits Markdown rather than dialect, so `_convert_line`
stays the single place that knows WhatsApp's spelling and the module stays usable
by the sibling channels that have the same gap. Two rules keep the table reduction
from losing an authored line, which the Slack copy it was modelled on does: a
separator row is REQUIRED before a run of pipe lines counts as a table, and a
table with no data rows is passed through verbatim. Tables are reduced per
non-fenced RUN, so a code sample full of pipes is never rewritten, and the mermaid
info string is read off the OPENER through the shared fence machine, so a mermaid
fence nested in a wider block stays content.

**The renderer is a registered `security_posture` redaction sink, and the screen
that carries the guarantee runs LAST.** This is the only markup-CONSUMING channel
whose own converter rewrites the delimiters: `TurnDriver` scans the provider stream
as literal bytes, so `AKIA**I**OSFODNN7EXAMPLE` matches no credential pattern,
`to_whatsapp_text` turns it into `AKIA*I*OSFODNN7EXAMPLE`, and the reader's client
strips the markers and shows an intact key. `to_whatsapp_text` therefore screens
through `display_safety.redact_for_display` AFTER every reduction, which is the
only form whose safety does not depend on which reductions ran: each of them
deletes a span, and deleting a span joins what sat on either side of it. A scan of
`AKIA<thinking>x</thinking>IOSFODNN7EXAMPLE` sees nothing at all, which is why
screening before the transform is the bypass rather than the fix. A second screen
runs before the conversion; it is a belt, and it also carries the ANSI
normalisation the conversion depends on, since every dialect rule is line-shaped
and an escape in front of a `#` hides the heading from it. `display_safe_text` is
the same screen without the conversion, for the sinks that do not pass through
`render_chunks` at all: the whole-reply fallback, a file-rejection note, an image
caption, and the approval prompt (whose tool title is model-authored and is
interpolated verbatim by `build_approval_prompt`). A screen on the chunk path alone
would leave all four as the bypass. The streaming and final paths are two more, and
both reach `render_chunks` through `_rendered_chunks`, which is why one screen
covers them. The link rewrite (`[label](url)` to `label (url)`) reads a link with
the screen's grammar, the shared `constants.md_link_destination` url pattern (one
level of balanced parentheses) and a label holding no `[`, `]` or line break, so a
link this converter names whole is one the screen collapsed to its label.

**Inline code is byte-exact through the conversion**
(`renderer._sub_outside_code`). The dialect has no escape character, so a backtick
span is the only way to show text WhatsApp must not reformat, and `__` inside
`` `/tmp/__init__.py` `` is a filename rather than emphasis. The guard tests the
DELIMITER positions rather than overlap, because emphasis legitimately spans a code
span (` **a `b` c** `) and skipping the whole match there would leave visible `**`
litter. `files.py::rejection_note` is built on this: the renderer's send path
converts everything it puts on the wire (`transport.send_message` →
`client.send_text` → `render_chunks`) and there is no unconverted send to reach
for, so the note is written to survive that round trip byte-identically instead.

**`_show` is the only thing that may advance `_sealed_count`.** Its contract is
"this chunk is on screen, and only then does the count advance", and it exists
because three call sites independently reached the same wrong conclusion: a closed
edit window, a refused streaming edit, and a refused final edit each counted a
chunk that never arrived, and once the count passes a chunk no later flush and no
`on_done` pass looks at it again, so the middle of a reply disappears with nothing
raised or logged. There is exactly one branchy fact, an edit can be refused, and
a refusal closes the bubble, so it is answered once. A replacement bubble repeats
whatever prefix the sealed one still shows, which is the right trade: a duplicated
sentence is visible and recoverable, a silently missing one is neither. The tail is
the one placement that does NOT advance the count, because the splitter can still
revise it; `_seal_chunk` advances in a `finally`, so a send that raises is not
retried on every later flush for the rest of the turn.

**`_rendered_chunks` detaches the protocol suffix, and that is what keeps it
MONOTONIC.** `_strip_options` only removes a COMPLETE trailer, so a still-arriving
`[OPTIONS: yes | n` renders into the live bubble as litter, and the length goes
with it: 4,089 visible characters plus that fragment is two chunks, while the
completed ` [OPTIONS: yes | no]` strips back to one. A flush landing in that window
leaves `_sealed_count` permanently above `len(chunks)`, so every later flush
returns at `_render_live`'s guard and `on_done` computes an empty pending slice:
the fragment stays on screen and the rest of the reply is dropped. Discord and
Telegram detach the same suffix at the same point with `split_trailing_protocol_suffix`.

**The composing indicator is dropped while an approval is pending.** `_hold_typing`
refreshes every 8 seconds and is otherwise cancelled only by `on_done`/`close`,
while the approval window is 300 seconds, so the operator would watch "typing" for
five minutes while the agent is in fact waiting on THEM. `on_prompt_choice` stops
the refresh once the prompt lands, and `_resume_typing` re-arms it lazily from
`on_text_chunk` and `on_tool_call`, because nothing reports a decision back to a
renderer: the driver dispatches `PROMPT_CHOICE` and only then awaits the decider,
so the next output event is the first news the wait is over.

**A timed-out approval is spoken, in place.** `on_prompt_choice` keeps the prompt's
own message id and registers `approval.PendingApproval.on_timeout`; when the window
closes the renderer edits that bubble to `approval.TIMEOUT_NOTICE`, falling back to
a fresh message when the edit is refused or its own window has closed. Without it
deny-on-silence is invisible: the tool is refused, the turn moves on, and a
live-looking prompt sits in the chat that a later `1` can no longer answer (it
finds no open entry and is reported as expired). The hook is a callback rather than
a transport because `approval.py` never learns what a channel is, and the renderer
that posted the prompt is the only thing that knows which bubble to edit; it is
awaited from `wait()`, so it never raises, a notice that could not be posted must
not become an approval.

**Context accounting rides `ChannelTurn.notice`, which is the channel's ONLY
reach into it.** `_maybe_notice` calls `sessions.check_context_usage`, and that
is the sole caller of the session manager's compaction trigger, so a
shared-pipeline channel that omits `notice=` has no compaction of any kind:
neither the threshold nudge nor the backend autocompactor. Past
`whatsapp.hard_threshold_pct` the context is compacted in place immediately
(the backend threshold sits higher), and past `whatsapp.soft_threshold_pct` the
operator is nudged once toward `/compact` or `/new`. The reading and the
compaction are session hygiene and run for every turn, because an overflowed
window costs the operator the conversation; only the TEXT is conditional, on the
same two rules `_react` carries -- an unprompted group turn may still be choosing
silence, and a muted conversation is one the operator switched off. The
awaiting-compact flag records that the nudge WAS SENT, so it is set only when one
goes out: setting it while suppressed would spend the single nudge a conversation
gets on a message nobody read. `/compact` and a fresh generation both clear it.

**`/compact` compacts, and its receipt describes what already happened.** It runs
in place under atomic `try_acquire` (compacting while a turn is mutating the same
session interleaves JSON-RPC on one provider and races the transcript), and a
refused acquire is disambiguated with `has_session`: a turn holds the session
(ask again) or there is no session (nothing to compact). Telling the operator the
wrong one, or acknowledging with a promise to compact later, leaves them waiting
for a compaction that never happens -- and on this channel there is no context
indicator to check it against.

**Commands** come from the table in `whatsapp/commands.py`, which is also what
`/help` is derived from, so a command cannot ship undocumented: `/new`,
`/compact`, `/help`, `/status`, `/stop`. Matching is whole-message and exact,
which is load-bearing rather than fussy: `receive` drops a non-operator group
message when `parse_command` is truthy, so a prefix match would start swallowing
ordinary group messages that merely begin with a slash. The table decides
operator-only per command, which is what lets `/help` stay answerable while
everything that acts on the session does not.

**Still not at parity with Slack**, listed rather than implied: rich blocks and
modals (no such surface exists), threads (quoting is not a thread), an App Home
equivalent, and inbound reaction events as a control channel. Read receipts are
deliberately absent rather than pending: `client.mark_read` exists, but calling it
writes to the operator's own account and overrides whatever read-receipt privacy
setting their phone carries, so it is a product decision and not a parity gap.

## Feishu channel

**Transport (`kiro_crew/feishu/`).** A concrete `MessagingTransport` over
`lark-oapi` (`client.py`): inbound rides the lark-oapi WebSocket long
connection (a daemon thread pushing normalized `LarkInbound` frames into the
async event loop via `run_coroutine_threadsafe`); outbound is REST reply
anchored to the inbound `message_id` (via `run_in_executor` so it never
blocks the event loop). The SDK caches its WebSocket event loop in a module
global when imported, while Kiro Crew imports it on the gateway loop and runs
`ws.Client.start()` in the receiver thread. The receiver therefore owns a
separate event loop, rebinds the SDK global, and constructs the client there
before `start()`; otherwise constructor-time helpers remain bound to the gateway
loop and the SDK calls `run_until_complete()` on that already-running loop. Shutdown
uses a public synchronous `stop()` when a future SDK provides one, and falls
back on current lark-oapi 1.x's async `_disconnect()` on the receiver loop with
auto-reconnect disabled. In both cases the receiver cancels pending SDK tasks
and closes its loop before the daemon thread exits.

`lark-oapi` is an OPTIONAL dependency declared as the
`[feishu]` extra in `setup.cfg` and lazily imported inside the client module;
`maybe_start_feishu` catches `ImportError` and logs a skip so a missing
library never takes down the gateway. No public webhook endpoint is required.
Capabilities: `streaming=False`, `edit=False`, `reactions=False`,
`files_inbound=False`, `files_outbound=False`, `rich_blocks=False`,
`threads=False`, `max_message_chars=4000`, `max_buttons=0`,
`supports_proactive_send=False`. Long replies are split with
`split_markdown_safe` (the shared fence-safe splitter from
`messaging/split.py`), not `chunk_text`.

**Redelivery suppression.** lark's WS may redeliver an event, so a bounded
message-id window lives in `FeishuTransport.receive` and is consulted as the LAST
gate — after the chat-type gate, the group allow-list and `authorize` — per the
cross-channel invariant above. Placed any earlier it is self-defeating: traffic
the bot can see but will never serve (an unauthorized sender, a group it merely
sits in, a sticker) would occupy the window, and crossing the cap trims 500 to
200 in one pass, so the id evicted is an authorized one and its redelivery
re-runs a turn's tool side effects. A frame with no `message_id` is dispatched
and never recorded — no id is no evidence of a duplicate, and inserting an empty
key would make every id-less frame a duplicate of the first. The window needs no
lock: `receive` runs on the event loop (the WS thread hands off via
`run_coroutine_threadsafe`), and the membership test and insert are not separated
by an `await`.

**Security model.** `authorize` is deny-by-default against
`feishu.allowed_open_ids`, which `FeishuTransport.reconfigure` replaces wholesale
on a config reload (so does the group pair below); every denial is
SEL-audited (`source="feishu"`). The Feishu app needs
`im:message.p2p_msg:readonly` to receive direct-message events and
`im:message:send_as_bot` to reply; enabling groups additionally needs
`im:message.group_at_msg.include_bot:readonly`. The broad `im:message` grant
alone does not activate p2p event delivery in the current Feishu console.
Group-chat access is an explicit opt-in gated on BOTH `allow_group=True` AND
the group's `chat_id` appearing in
`allowed_group_ids`; every other context is denied with a SEL audit record
(`denied_group_not_allowed`). `FEISHU_APP_SECRET` is on the sandbox agent env
denylist.

**Dispatch + rendering.** Turns ride the shared `TurnDriver`
(`transport_dispatch.py` mirrors the WeCom dispatcher: `/new`, `/compact`
command intercept, mid-turn messages fold into the running turn via steer
gated on `has_active_turn`, `/compact` under atomic `try_acquire`, soft/hard
context-threshold notices as separate proactive messages). The soft notice is
latched per route and released on BOTH the hard-threshold compaction and a
manual `/compact`, so it stays a per-growth-cycle nudge instead of decaying
into a once-ever one. `messaging.idle_reset_minutes` / `daily_reset_hour` are
honoured through `ConversationState.maybe_rotate`, called AFTER the busy check
— rotating first would mint a new generation and miss an in-flight turn on the
current key — with the session key re-derived afterwards. The turn carries a
`build_directive_consumer` so the session-directive tools (`monitor_start`,
`autonudge_stop`, …) apply against the Feishu session rather than returning a
marker the driver leaves inert while still reporting success to the model;
dashboard-only directives stay refused for a channel turn (`slot=None`,
fail-closed). The dispatcher runs decider-less (no interactive buttons); an
`[OPTIONS:]` trailer degrades to a numbered text list through the shared
`render_options_as_text`. The renderer buffers the complete turn and sends it as
one reply on `on_done` — no streaming, no edit-in-place. Because nothing is shown
before `on_done`, an UNFINISHED `[OPTIONS` tail is kept rather than cut: there is
no partial frame for it to flash in, so it can only be the assistant's own prose.

**Session identity.** A p2p turn keys on `open_id` under the `DIRECT` chat
type; a group turn keys on the group's `chat_id` under the non-direct
(`FORUM`) chat type, so a group turn never resumes the sender's private DM
bucket — including under `dm_scope: unified`, where a direct key collapses to
the cross-channel bucket and a group key deliberately does not.

**A group turn is minimal-context for everyone.** The key above isolates the
turn HISTORY, which is only half the disclosure: memory, lessons and skills are
assembled by the context builder, not read from the session, so a group turn
runs with `minimal_context=True` regardless of who sent it. The property that
matters belongs to the CONVERSATION rather than to the sender — a group's key is
the group, so one session serves every member, and an allow-listed sender
addressing the agent in a group would otherwise inject their private context
into a reply the whole group reads. The p2p session is where context-rich work
belongs. WhatsApp's extra `not is_operator` clause does not transfer: its
transport is the operator's own account and can tell the operator from a peer,
whereas Feishu has a bot identity and authorises against `allowed_open_ids`,
where every admitted DM sender is an equally-trusted peer with their own
`open_id`-keyed bucket.

## Adding a channel

### What a new channel inherits for free

Implement only Layer 1 (`Transport`) + Layer 2b (`Renderer`) and register it.
You automatically get: LLM-output redaction, the SEL-audited approval ladder,
namespaced session identity + per-conversation state, capability-driven
graceful degradation, and long-message chunking.

### Step by step

1. **Declare capabilities.** Build a `TransportCapabilities` describing the
   channel's limits (char cap, buttons, streaming/edit/reactions, proactive
   send). The neutral layers read these instead of branching on channel type.

2. **Implement `MessagingTransport`** (`<channel>/transport.py`):
   - `channel_type = "<name>"`, `capabilities = <caps>`
   - `send_message` / `resolve_conversation` / `fetch_history` against the
     channel API
   - `authorize(msg)` — **deny-by-default**; allow only known/owner users
   - `receive(raw)` — parse the channel's inbound payload → build an
     `InboundMessage` → `authorize()` → hand off to dispatch (drop bot echoes)
   - optionally `connect`/`maintain`/`disconnect` for webhook/poll lifecycle

3. **Implement `Renderer`** (`<channel>/renderer.py`): map each `on_*`
   callback onto the channel API. Use `chunk_text()` for `max_message_chars`;
   render `on_prompt_choice` with the channel's interactive controls (or, if
   `capabilities` lacks buttons, degrade to a numbered text prompt). Name the
   tool from that callback's `tool_title`/`tool_purpose`, which describe the tool
   THIS request asks about: never from a remembered earlier `on_tool_call`, which
   names the previous tool whenever a permission arrives without one of its own.
   The `options` are the ANSWERS, so an option label is not a tool name either.

4. **Wire dispatch** (`<channel>/transport_dispatch.py`): mirror
   `slack/transport_dispatch.py` — acquire the session (namespaced
   `session_key`), build context, construct the `Renderer` + `TurnDriver`, and
   `await driver.run(message)`. Reuse the neutral `TurnDriver` unchanged.

5. **Register + gate.** Add one `ChannelDescriptor` to `builtin_channel_descriptors()` in `kiro_crew/channels.py` — the single place that knows every channel — carrying `channel_type`, the `maybe_start_<channel>` boot factory, and the credential keys / `required_config` its readiness answer needs. `messaging/registry.py` owns the descriptor type and the boot/shutdown loops; it must not import a channel package (the `<channel> -> messaging` direction is pinned in `messaging/dispatch.py`), which is why the roster lives above both. `channel_type` is the ONE identity everywhere: governance member id, `MessagingTransport.channel_type`, session-key segment, config section name, dashboard badge prefix. Slack's descriptor carries `start=None` because its socket-client lifecycle is host-managed. Then route the channel's inbound events to your dispatch, and keep the channel's own `enabled` gate off until validated.

6. **Lock behavior with a transcript-style test**: drive a scripted provider
   event stream through the real turn (see `test/test_slack_renderer.py`) and
   assert the ordered channel-API call sequence, so future refactors can't
   silently change UX.
