# Resource Protection Mechanisms

Kiro Crew runs long-lived LLM sessions that spawn OS processes (kiro-cli, MCP servers) across
several workflows: chat subagents, cron jobs, task runner steps, and background sessions.
Each workflow has different failure modes (event-loop saturation, orphaned tasks, hung
processes, context overflow), so protection is layered. Primary timeouts catch the common
case, independent watchdogs catch what timeouts miss, and startup/periodic sweeps clean up
anything that survived a gateway crash. No single mechanism is a single point of failure.

## Mechanism table

| Mechanism | Module | Scope | Timeout / threshold | Independent watchdog? | What happens when it fires |
|-----------|--------|-------|--------------------|-----------------------|---------------------------|
| `asyncio.wait_for` on `_run_inner` | `subagent.py` | Subagent tasks | 3 h (`agent.subagent_timeout_secs`, `_TIMEOUT_SECS` fallback) | No (see reaper below) | Raises `TimeoutError`, marks subagent failed, resets session |
| Periodic reaper loop | `subagent.py` | Subagent tasks | 60s sweep (`_REAPER_INTERVAL`), kills at the same deadline | Yes, runs independently of the spawning session | `_force_reap`: reset, SIGKILL fallback, mark done, SEL audit, announce |
| Startup watchdog | `subagent.py` | Pre-first-turn subagents | Two handshake rounds of the spawn's `initialize` budget plus the session-start budget, plus the late-start collector wait plus a 30s margin, at least 120s, with no runtime; measured on a clock that pauses while the start is queued (`SubagentManager._startup_deadline`) | Yes | Reaps a subagent that never got a runtime |
| Reset timeout in `_run` finally | `subagent.py` | Subagent cleanup | 30s (`_RESET_TIMEOUT`) | No | SIGKILL fallback plus SEL audit if `reset()` hangs |
| Turn limit | `subagent.py` | Subagent tool calls | 1000 turns (`_TURN_LIMIT`, configurable) | No | Stops execution, returns partial output |
| Stall surfacing | `subagent.py` | Running subagents | 120s with no stream activity (`_STALL_IDLE_SECS`) | Yes | Surfaces the subagent as "stalled" in the UI |
| `asyncio.wait_for` on `_execute` | `cron.py` | Cron jobs | Per-job `timeout_secs` (default 30 min from `_JOB_TIMEOUT_SECS`, valid range 1..86400s) | No | Raises `TimeoutError`, logs error, marks job failed |
| Periodic reaper loop | `cron.py` | Cron jobs | 60s sweep (`_REAPER_INTERVAL`), kills at the same per-job deadline; reset bounded by `_REAPER_RESET_TIMEOUT` (30s) | Yes, runs independently of job execution | `_force_reap`: reset, SIGKILL fallback, mark failed, SEL audit |
| Task runner watchdog | `taskrunner.py` | Task runner steps | 60 min warn / 2 hr kill (`STALL_TIMEOUT` / `STALL_CANCEL_TIMEOUT` in `task_models.py`) | Yes, 30s heartbeat loop (`_HEARTBEAT_INTERVAL`) | Notifies on stall, resets the stuck session after 2 hr |
| Global task timeout | `taskrunner.py` | Entire task run | User-configurable (`--timeout`) | Checked in the watchdog loop | Stops the task run, marks failed |
| ACP process death detection | `acp/client.py` | All sessions | 5 consecutive empty reads (`_MAX_CONSECUTIVE_EMPTY`) | No | Raises `AcpProcessDied`, triggers session recovery |
| ACP init timeout | `acp/client.py` | Session creation | 4 min (`_INIT_TIMEOUT`; MCP servers can be slow to initialize) | No | Raises `AcpTimeoutError`, retries once |
| ACP prompt timeout | `acp/client.py` | Per prompt | 4 hr (`_DEFAULT_PROMPT_TIMEOUT`) | No | Raises `AcpTimeoutError` |
| ACP read timeout | `acp/client.py` | Per readline | 20s (`_READ_TIMEOUT`) | No | Allows `CancelledError` delivery at each yield point |
| Cooperative-cancel grace | `acp/client.py` | Per cancel | `max(_CANCEL_GRACE_SECS, caller budget)`, floor 10s | No | Read loop abandons the turn as unresponsive once the grace elapses |
| Process group kill | `acp/client.py` | Process cleanup | Immediate | No | `killpg(SIGTERM)`, `killpg(SIGKILL)`, then `_kill_escaped_children` for descendants that changed PGID |
| Per-process resource limits | `security.py` (`apply_resource_limits`), delivered **after `exec`** by `_spawn_exec_shim.py` via `sandbox.py` (`create_subprocess_limited` / `spawn_shim_argv`) | Every agent-influenced spawn (see the profile list below) | Kernel-enforced `RLIMIT_NOFILE=1024` default-on; `RLIMIT_NPROC` / `RLIMIT_CPU` / `RLIMIT_AS` opt-in (default off) | Yes, the kernel enforces at fork/alloc/open time, no sweep needed | Kernel refuses `open()` past the FD cap (EMFILE); on opt-in NPROC/CPU/AS: EAGAIN, SIGXCPU, ENOMEM |
| Windows Job object (fork bomb + memory) | `platform_compat.py` (`apply_job_limits`) via `sandbox.py` (`apply_windows_resource_ceiling`) | The ACP agent spawn tree on Windows (`AcpClient._spawn` and `AcpRuntime._spawn`), where `cgroup_scope_argv` is a no-op | `ActiveProcessLimit` plus `JobMemoryLimit`, read from the SAME `resource_limits` config as the cgroup path so one setting governs both platforms. The memory limit is the true `MemoryMax` equivalent, and its default is derived from `GlobalMemoryStatusEx` because the POSIX `os.sysconf` probe does not exist on Windows and the flat fallback it fell back to could equal or exceed physical RAM on a small host, leaving the ceiling unable to engage. The process limit is NOT a one-for-one `TasksMax` mapping: `TasksMax` counts tasks (threads) while `ActiveProcessLimit` counts processes, so the same budget binds more loosely here, though it still bounds a fork bomb | Yes, the kernel refuses the spawn or allocation | Fork bomb bounded: past the process limit the member's `CreateProcess` fails with `ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_QUOTA` (1816); past the memory limit allocations fail. `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` is deliberately NOT set (it would make a gateway exit kill running agents, a lifecycle change rather than a ceiling); omitting it also means the handle need not be held, since a job stays alive while processes are assigned, so limits persist after `CloseHandle` with no handle registry. Applied while the child is still suspended (`CREATE_SUSPENDED`), then resumed via `resume_process_main_thread`, because job membership covers a member's FUTURE descendants only. Fails soft: any Win32 error logs a SECURITY warning and returns `False`, never failing the spawn |
| cgroup v2 scope (fork bomb + memory) | `sandbox.py` (`cgroup_scope_argv`) | Every agent-influenced spawn tree (each ACP harness process tree gets a scope; subagent sessions sharing that runtime stay in its tree, while a dedicated subagent process gets its own; each cron, app-backend, hook, git or tool spawn also gets its own) | `pids.max=8192` (`TasksMax`) plus `memory.max=65% of host RAM` (`MemoryMax`, `MemorySwapMax=0`) per transient `systemd-run --user --scope` under `kirocrew-agents.slice`, default-on where cgroup v2 delegation exists | Yes, the kernel enforces at `fork()`/alloc time; OOM-kills the scope on a memory breach, `fork()` fails EAGAIN past `pids.max` — **per scope**: the aggregate across concurrent scopes is bounded by the slice row below | Fork bomb bounded to `pids.max`; memory balloon OOM-killed at `memory.max`. Unavailable (no delegation, macOS): no-op plus one loud SECURITY warning, `RLIMIT_NOFILE` still applies |
| cgroup v2 slice (aggregate across concurrent spawns) | `sandbox.py` (`ensure_agents_slice_limits`), applied at gateway startup | ALL concurrent agent scopes together (they are siblings under `kirocrew-agents.slice`) | `memory.max=80% of host RAM` (`MemoryMax`, `MemorySwapMax=0`) plus `pids.max=32768` (`TasksMax`) on the slice, via `systemctl --user set-property --runtime`; overridable via `resource_limits.max_total_memory_mb` / `max_total_processes` | Yes — cgroup v2 bounds a descendant by the **minimum** effective limit of itself and all ancestors, so N scopes at 65% each can no longer jointly exceed the slice ceiling | Kernel OOM-kills some scope inside the slice on an aggregate breach; the resource-pressure sampler logs new kills with victim scopes, slice `memory.current`, and whether the slice ceiling (vs a scope's own) engaged. Same availability gate and single SECURITY warning as the scope row |
| Aggregate agent-slice soft ceiling (throttle) | `sandbox.py` (`_ensure_agent_slice_memory_high`) | The SUM of all concurrent agent scopes (`kirocrew-agents.slice` as one subtree); never the gateway, which runs outside the slice | `memory.high=75% of host RAM` on the slice (`systemctl --user set-property --runtime`); deliberately NOT config-driven — the slice is UID-global and shared by every gateway instance (live, dev, pods), so no single instance may lift the others' ceiling; default-on where cgroup v2 delegation exists | Yes, the kernel throttles-and-reclaims the whole subtree past `memory.high` | Concurrent agent trees that together cross 75% get throttled BEFORE the slice's hard 80% `MemoryMax` (row above) OOM-kills a scope; the reconcile worker also watches the slice's `memory.events` `high` counter and logs once per climbing episode so "agents mysteriously slow" is diagnosable as ceiling throttling. Two consumers read the slice as well: the cgroup-clamped memory probe behind `resource_status` / `admission_check` / `compute_max_subagents` takes the slice's headroom (`min(memory.high, memory.max)` minus the working set, which is `memory.current` less inactive page cache) as one of its ceilings, so posture reaches `critical` once agent memory the kernel cannot drop fills the ceiling, even though host `MemAvailable` is still large, and a critical posture still defers cron's `every`/`at` firings (a cron-expression job is never deferred) and the TaskRunner and workflow rows, which read `admission_check` (the rows through `cached_admission_check`) -- spawns do not read posture at all: only the per-spawn `agent.spawn_min_memory_gb` floor holds one, it reads the same clamped figure and must remain AFTER a start's price, and a start that does not fit waits in the queue (in memory when it has no durable row) instead of being refused on capacity -- the one refusal is a durable start whose wait the task store cannot record, which answers the store's error (`task_store_unavailable`); a slice held at `memory.high` only by cold file cache is not refused, because reclaiming that cache is cheap; and `AcpRuntime` reads `sandbox.agents_slice_throttling()` (`memory.current >= memory.high`, or the `high` counter climbing between probes) when its `initialize` handshake (cold-start budget `_INITIALIZE_TIMEOUT`, throttled or not) runs out — a deadline that lands with the process still alive under throttle raises `AcpRuntimeOverloaded` rather than reporting a killed process; that error carries `transient = False`, so the retry layers that read the verdict structurally do not respawn a fresh cold start into the same throttle, and the message names the remedy (free agent memory). Unavailable or `systemctl` fails: no-op plus one loud SECURITY warning, the slice and per-scope `MemoryMax` still apply |
| Bounded restart shutdown | `dashboard/handlers/sessions.py` | Dashboard Apply & Restart | 10s (`_SHUTDOWN_TIMEOUT_SECS`) | No | `asyncio.wait_for` on `provider.shutdown()`; `_sync_kill_provider` fallback on timeout |
| Subagent injection outer cap | `subagent.py` `_run()` | Per-subagent completion | 1200s (`_ON_DONE_TIMEOUT`) | No | Covers semaphore wait plus injection; on timeout kills the stuck kiro-cli via `sessions.reset()` and queues a failure event for the parent to drain |
| Subagent injection inner cap | `slack/gateway.py` | Per `stream_and_collect` | 900s (`INJECTION_TIMEOUT`, from `_DEFAULT_INJECTION_TIMEOUT`; override with `KIROCREW_INJECTION_TIMEOUT`, clamped down to `_ON_DONE_TIMEOUT`) | No | `_inject_with_retry` up to 3 attempts with backoff, bounded by the outer 1200s cap |
| Prompt-busy recovery | `llm_helpers.py` | Per `stream_and_collect` | 2 retries plus backoff | No | Cancels the orphaned prompt; kills the provider on exhaustion |
| Message queue | `session.py` plus `events.py` | Per Slack thread | Unbounded FIFO | No | Queues when busy; `message_deleted` cancels; `!stop` clears |
| Orphaned dashboard reaping | `session.py` | Dashboard sessions | Immediate | Yes | `set_active_dashboard_slots()` reaps sessions whose slot is gone |
| Empty dir cleanup | `session.py` | `sessions/` subdirs | Startup | No | Removes empty dirs left by timed-out subagents |
| `cleanup_orphaned_sessions` | `session_pid.py` | All kiro-cli PIDs | Startup and shutdown only | No | Reads `kiro_pids.txt`, validates liveness, sends SIGKILL, clears the file. Also removes stale `session_pid_*.txt` files for dead processes, and calls `_cleanup_orphaned_mcp_servers()` internally |
| `_cleanup_orphaned_mcp_servers` | `session_pid.py` | MCP child PIDs | Every ~5 min (periodic sweep) | Yes, runs in `_cleanup_loop` | Scans for orphaned MCP processes, sends SIGKILL |
| Idle session expiry | `session.py` | All sessions | `session.timeout_secs`, clamped up to a 60s minimum; `0` disables the sweep but keeps process hygiene | Yes, runs in `_cleanup_loop` (~5 min interval) | Calls `provider.shutdown()`, removes the session |
| Circuit breaker | `session.py` | Per session | 5 consecutive failures (`_CIRCUIT_BREAKER_THRESHOLD`) | No | Auto-resets the session (kills the process, creates a fresh one) |
| Context compaction | `session.py` | Chat sessions | `session.autocompact_pct` | No | Sends `/compact` to kiro-cli to free context window |
| Background session recycle | `session.py` | Background sessions (cron, subagent) | 70% context usage (`_BG_RECYCLE_PCT`) | No | Recycles the session before context overflow |
| Watchdog process liveness | `taskrunner.py` | Task runner steps | 2 consecutive dead checks (`_DEAD_THRESHOLD`) at 30s intervals | Yes, part of the watchdog loop | Resets the session to trigger crash recovery |
| Config bound clamp | `config/loader.py` | Subagent count, turns, timeouts and pool size at load time | `subagent_auto_max` and `max_subagents` to 64 (`SUBAGENT_AUTO_MAX_CEILING`), `subagent_max_turns` 1..1000, `subagent_timeout_secs` 60..86400 (0 preserved as its "use the default" sentinel), `chat_turn_timeout_secs` 300..86400 (`CHAT_TURN_TIMEOUT_MAX`; 14400 is the default, not the ceiling), `session_start_timeout_secs`, `tool_approval_timeout_secs` 30..7200 and cross-field to 60s under the turn ceiling (`APPROVAL_TURN_MARGIN_SECS`), `loop_stall_exit_after_secs` 10..300, `pool_size` 0..10 (`_SECURITY_BOUNDED_FIELDS`) | No | `_clamp_security_bounds` clamps out-of-range ints, logs a WARNING, emits SEL `config_bounds_clamped` (`outcome=clamped`) |

## Per-workflow coverage matrix

|  | Primary timeout | Watchdog / reaper | Process cleanup | Context management |
|--|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Chat subagents** | `wait_for` 3 h | Reaper (60s sweep) | `reset()` plus SIGKILL fallback | `_BG_RECYCLE_PCT` 70% recycle |
| **Cron jobs** | Per-job `timeout_secs` (30 min default, 1..86400s) | Reaper (60s sweep, same deadline) | `reset()` plus SIGKILL fallback | `_BG_RECYCLE_PCT` 70% recycle |
| **Task runner** | Global timeout plus stall detection | Watchdog (30s heartbeat) | `_cleanup_run_sessions` plus `asyncio.shield` | Compaction at `autocompact_pct` |
| **Other background sessions** (shared: heartbeat, lessons) | Workflow-specific cap where present (heartbeat: 30 min); otherwise idle expiry | Periodic sweep (~5 min) | `cleanup_orphaned_sessions` at startup | `_BG_RECYCLE_PCT` 70% recycle |

The shared background-session row has no universal per-turn timeout: heartbeat
adds its own 30-minute task cap, while a workflow without one relies on idle
expiry, its own watchdog, or context recycle. Cron is listed separately because
its persisted `timeout_secs` supplies a per-wake deadline.

## Per-process resource limits

`security.apply_resource_limits(config)` resolves the POSIX `setrlimit` caps, and
`sandbox._rlimit_spec()` renders them as the `RLIMIT_NAME:value` policy string that
`_spawn_exec_shim.py` applies **after `exec`**, in the single-threaded child.
`sandbox.create_subprocess_limited()` is the accessor every agent-influenced ASYNC spawn
uses: it prepends the shim via `spawn_shim_argv()` and passes `preexec_fn=None`.

Five profiles:

| Profile | Used by | Effect |
|---------|---------|--------|
| `tool` (default) | Every ordinary agent-influenced spawn | The full rlimit ceiling plus `oom_score_adj=1000` |
| `extractor` | The PDF text-extraction child (`pdf_extract.py` -> `python -m kiro_crew.pdf_extract_child`), fed untrusted document bytes on stdin by file-grep and knowledge ingest | A FIXED ceiling independent of `resource_limits`: `RLIMIT_AS` 1 GiB, `RLIMIT_CPU` 60 s, `RLIMIT_NOFILE` 1024, plus the OOM bias. `pdfplumber` allocates a page's whole character list before any caller can measure it, so the memory bound has to be on by default and one process down; a pure-CPython child measures ~270 MB virtual on a one-page document, which is why a virtual cap is safe here where `tool` leaves it opt-in. On Windows (no rlimits) `pdf_extract.py` spawns the child `CREATE_SUSPENDED`, attaches a Job object with `JobMemoryLimit` at the same byte count via `platform_compat.apply_job_limits`, and FAILS CLOSED -- kills the unrun child and reports `unbounded` -- when the job cannot be attached. macOS accepts `RLIMIT_AS` without enforcing it, so the child additionally polices its own peak RSS (sampled every 20 ms) against the same 1 GiB and ends itself with the `memory` report: the ceiling there, a second layer on Linux. The sample is the CHILD's own high-water mark: `getrusage` `ru_maxrss` on macOS, but `/proc/self/status` `VmHWM` on Linux, because there `execve` folds the pre-exec image's peak into `ru_maxrss` and a child of a gateway already past 1 GiB would read its parent's peak on the first tick and lose every document unparsed |
| `session_host` | The trusted ACP session-host spawns (`acp/client.py`, `acp/runtime.py`) | RAISES NOFILE to the inherited hard limit and does nothing else. A session host multiplexes many MCP pipe pairs, and the 1024 cap caused EMFILE crashes. No OOM bias: a trusted session host must not be the preferred kill target |
| `build` | The dev-fleet build spawns (`apps/builtins/dev_fleet/runtime.py`) | Vite and npm need thousands of descriptors; keeps the OOM bias |
| `none` | The user's own interactive terminal | No rlimits and no OOM bias, so the shim is skipped entirely unless the spawn also asks for a controlling terminal (`ctty_fd=`), which the terminal does |

Async, shim-routed spawns cover MCP server probes (`mcp_discovery.py`), the app
registry's clone and build spawns (`apps/registry.py`, `apps/registry_pipeline/`, `apps/routes.py`), the task
runner's test spawn (`task_executor.py`), agent-selected git (`git_coord.py`), shell
hooks (`hooks.py`), the knowledge worker pool (`knowledge/llm_pool.py`), voice
synthesis (`voice_reply.py`), the source-provider CLI spawns
(`dashboard/source_providers/runner.py`), and the builtin app subprocesses under
`apps/builtins/`. Synchronous `subprocess.run` / `Popen` spawns route through
`run_limited()` / `popen_limited()`, the sync siblings of the async wrapper: same
post-exec delivery, same refusal of a caller-supplied `preexec_fn`, and the same
fallback to `preexec_fn` when a profile carries policy but no shim is available.
The core gateway is migrated, including cron scripts (`cron_script.py`) and
app-backend dependency installs (`apps/backend.py` npm, `apps/backend_runtime/provisioning.py` pip), and so are the builtin app
backends under `apps/builtins/` and the two standalone scripts under
`deploy/skills/`. No call site passes `resource_limit_preexec()` as `preexec_fn=`
any more; the shrink-only ratchet in `test/test_spawn_preexec_guard.py` is empty
and fails on any NEW synchronous `preexec_fn` spawn anywhere under
`src/kiro_crew`. A synchronous spawn wedges a worker thread rather than the event
loop, so the hazard below does not apply to it with the same force, but it is the
same `fork()` and the child still inherits every open fd until it `exec`s.

Because the shim source rides in argv as a single ~8 KB `-c` element, the sync
wrappers reset what the spawn reports back — `CompletedProcess.args`, `Popen.args`,
and the `cmd` of a `CalledProcessError` / `TimeoutExpired` — to the command's own
argv, so a `check=True` or timeout failure does not put the whole shim into the log
line.

`test/test_spawn_audit.py` enforces that every sandbox-routed spawn also applies the
ceiling, so the helper cannot regress into dead code.

### Why after `exec` and not in a `preexec_fn`

`preexec_fn` forces CPython off `posix_spawn`/`vfork` onto a plain `fork()` of the
multi-GB, roughly-118-thread gateway, and runs Python bytecode in the child before
`exec`. A lock another thread held at fork time cannot be released there, so the child can
wedge before ever reaching `exec`, and a wedged child takes more than itself down:

- `subprocess.Popen._execute_child` blocks in an unbounded `os.read(errpipe_read, ...)`
  waiting for the child to exec or die. For `asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` that read runs
  on the event loop thread with no `await` point, so no `asyncio.wait_for` can interrupt it
  and the whole gateway stops.
- `_posixsubprocess`'s `child_exec()` runs `_close_open_fds()` *after* `preexec_fn`, so the
  wedged child still holds a duplicate of every inherited fd, `gateway.lock` and the
  dashboard's listening socket included, which then outlive the gateway.

This is observed behavior, not theory: a child deadlocked in a futex, never exec'd, and
pinned the fds it inherited. Limits set post-`exec` are inherited by the exec'd image and
all its descendants, so coverage is unchanged; only the delivery point moved.
`test/test_spawn_preexec_guard.py` is the AST tripwire that keeps a new async call site
from reintroducing the fork.

**One documented exception**, allowlisted in the tripwire:

- `sandbox.create_subprocess_limited`'s own fallback, for a host with no usable shim
  (non-POSIX, or a truncated install). Dropping the caps silently would be worse.

`dashboard/handlers/terminal.py`'s interactive shell is NOT an exception, and the reason is
worth stating because the callable a fork would run there looks harmless. It carries the
`none` profile, so the shim has no *limits* to deliver for it, and the callable is a single
pre-resolved `ioctl` claiming the PTY as the controlling terminal -- no allocation, no lock
acquisition. The fork it forces is not harmless: at 3GB resident and 121 threads the
page-table copy holds the event loop for **107ms per terminal open** (13ms at 0.52GB, so it
tracks resident size), and a clone that cannot reach `exec` holds it without bound. The shim
carries the claim instead, through `--ctty-fd=`, which brings the loop-side cost to
**0.5ms**: the interpreter startup it adds is paid by the CHILD after `exec`, not by the
loop waiting for it.

### Defaults: one safe blanket limit, three opt-in knobs

- **`RLIMIT_NOFILE = 1024` (default-on)**, max open file descriptors. It is
  **per-process**, generous enough that no legitimate tool trips it, yet finite, so a
  descriptor leak (which climbs unbounded) is arrested. This is the only limit safe as a
  blanket default.
- **`RLIMIT_NPROC = 0` (disabled).** It is enforced **per real UID** against the count of
  ALL the user's existing processes *and threads*, not the spawn's own subtree. A busy
  login or desktop UID routinely holds thousands of threads (roughly 3600 measured on one
  dev host), so any fixed cap tight enough to bound a fork bomb already sits below the
  host's baseline and would make **every** spawn fail to fork (EAGAIN), strictly worse than
  the DoS gap. Safe to enable only when the gateway runs as its own dedicated UID. cgroup
  v2 `pids.max` (per-cgroup, not per-UID) is the correct fork-bomb ceiling. Darwin nuance:
  the kernel silently clamps a non-root `RLIMIT_NPROC` to `kern.maxprocperuid`, which can
  sit below the inherited hard cap (`kern.maxproc`); the clamp is strictly tighter, so
  enforcement is unaffected, and `test_config_overrides_applied` folds the sysctl into its
  expectation on macOS.
- **`RLIMIT_CPU = 0` (disabled).** CPU-seconds accrue over a process's **whole lifetime**,
  and the root agent runs up to a 30-minute turn while a busy tool-heavy session can
  legitimately burn hundreds of CPU-seconds, so a non-zero global cap would `SIGXCPU`-kill
  healthy sessions. Opt in per deployment only when the spawn population is exclusively
  short-lived.
- **`RLIMIT_AS = 0` (disabled).** It caps **virtual** address space, not resident memory,
  and Node/V8 (kiro-cli, every npm MCP server) reserves huge virtual mappings far exceeding
  real use (roughly 2 GB VSZ measured for 4 idle worker threads, 3.4 GB for 8), so even a
  generous 4 GB cap `SIGKILL`s normal MCP-heavy sessions with spurious ENOMEM. cgroup v2
  `memory.max` is the correct RSS ceiling; `RLIMIT_AS` is left as an opt-in escape hatch for
  non-Node fleets.

**Config.** Operators override the defaults with a `resource_limits` object in the config
JSON: `max_processes`, `max_open_files`, `max_cpu_seconds`, `max_memory_mb` (per-scope),
plus `max_total_memory_mb` and `max_total_processes` (aggregate, on the slice), each a
positive int to set and `0` to leave inherited. A requested limit is always clamped **down**
to the inherited hard limit, so the helper only tightens, never raises. On non-POSIX
platforms (no `resource` module) it is a no-op; on a platform lacking a specific rlimit
(macOS has no `RLIMIT_NPROC`) that limit degrades gracefully.

## The cgroup v2 scope

Because RLIMIT is the wrong tool for the fork-bomb and memory-DoS threats (`RLIMIT_NPROC`
is per-UID, `RLIMIT_AS` caps virtual rather than resident memory), the actual default-on
defense for both is a **cgroup v2 scope** applied by `sandbox.cgroup_scope_argv()`. Every
agent-influenced spawn is wrapped in a transient `systemd-run --user --scope` nested under
an instance-specific child of `kirocrew-agents.slice`. The child separates live,
dev, and pod gateway populations; the shared parent remains the aggregate hard
and soft enforcement boundary. Each scope has:

- **`TasksMax`** = `pids.max`, default **8192** from `_CGROUP_DEFAULT_MAX_PROCESSES`
  (override via `resource_limits.max_processes`), the **fork-bomb** ceiling. `pids.max`
  counts tasks (threads), not processes. 1024 starved legitimate JVM build trees (Gradle
  plus parallel test workers need thousands of threads, failing as `pthread_create` EAGAIN
  while the host is idle); 8192 still bounds fork bombs, which spawn tens of thousands of
  tasks near-instantly. It is per-cgroup, so it bounds the agent plus all its MCP-server and
  tool descendants as one unit without the per-UID footgun. `fork()` fails `EAGAIN` past it.
- **`MemoryMax`** plus **`MemorySwapMax=0`** = `memory.max`, default **65% of physical RAM**
  (`_CGROUP_MEMORY_FRACTION`, roughly 10.6 GB on a 16 GB box and 21.3 GB on 32 GB;
  overridable via `max_memory_mb`, with an 8192 MB fallback from
  `_CGROUP_FALLBACK_MAX_MEMORY_MB` when host RAM cannot be read), the **memory-balloon**
  ceiling. It scales with the machine, where a flat 8 GB cap was both too tight on big boxes
  and too loose on small ones. There is deliberately **no floor**: a floor could push a tiny
  box above 65%, and 65% is the ceiling on our take. It is a **per-scope** cap (each spawn
  tree gets its own scope), so it bounds a single runaway tree while leaving headroom for the
  OS and the gateway; the aggregate across concurrent scopes is bounded separately by the
  slice ceiling below. It is a
  true RSS cap, not virtual, so it does not trip on Node/V8's large virtual mappings; the
  kernel OOM-kills the scope on breach.
- **`CPUWeight`**, default **50** from `_CGROUP_DEFAULT_CPU_WEIGHT` (systemd's own default is
  100; override via `resource_limits.cpu_weight`), the **CPU fair-share** control, emitted
  only when the `cpu` controller is delegated. It is a proportional share, never a hard
  throttle: agent scopes use 100% of an idle host but yield to interactive work under CPU
  contention. A hard cap, `CPUQuota`, is available **opt-in only** via
  `resource_limits.max_cpu_percent` (`200` = 2 cores) and is off by default because hard
  quotas slow legitimate builds.

The spawn shim additionally writes `oom_score_adj=1000` on the child it execs (inherited by
its descendants), biasing the kernel OOM killer toward tool subprocesses so a
memory-ballooning command is killed *before* `memory.max` takes out the entire agent scope.
It is requested explicitly (`--oom-bias`) by the `tool`, `build` and `extractor` profiles
only (`_PROFILE_OOM_BIAS`).

### Scope unit names

`systemd-run` names a scope after the invocation (`run-u<N>.scope`) unless it is
given a `--unit`, so a scope in a kernel OOM report or a `systemctl` listing
identifies nothing about what it held. `AcpRuntime._spawn` passes
`--unit kirocrew-rt-<spawn instance>.scope` (`sandbox.scope_unit_name` builds the
name, `sandbox.name_scope_unit` inserts it) and logs that unit name beside the
runtime's pid at initialization, so an operator reading a kill can join the scope
back to the runtime it held, and from that pid to the sessions it served — those
are logged against the same pid as they are created.

Every other wrap keeps the default anonymous name: `AcpClient._spawn`, cron,
app-backend, hook, git and tool spawns. For `AcpClient._spawn` that is deliberate
here — its spawn instance exists only in memory and is never written to the
child's environment, so a name alone would not outlive the kill it is meant to
explain. Giving that path a durable token is harness-parity work, not part of this
naming pass.

### The aggregate slice ceiling (`memory.high` on `kirocrew-agents.slice`)

`MemoryMax` is a **per-scope** cap, and scopes are created per spawn — so several
concurrent agent trees, each legitimately under its own 65% ceiling, can still **sum past
physical RAM** and livelock a swapless host: nothing individually breaches, everything
collectively starves. The containment for that failure mode is one level up, on the slice
every agent scope is parented under. `sandbox._ensure_agent_slice_memory_high()` sets
**`MemoryHigh`** on `kirocrew-agents.slice`, always **75% of physical RAM**
(`_SLICE_MEMORY_HIGH_FRACTION`, with a `_SLICE_FALLBACK_MEMORY_HIGH_MB` = 12288 MB fallback
when RAM cannot be read). The ceiling is deliberately **not config-driven**: the slice is
UID-global — every gateway instance under the user (live, dev-backend, pods where delegation
applies) parents scopes into the same slice — so a per-instance config key would let one
permissively-configured instance lift or lower the ceiling that protects the others.
Past `memory.high` the kernel **throttles and reclaims** the whole subtree
instead of OOM-killing it — agents slow down, the host stays interactive, and each scope's
`memory.max` still hard-kills an individual runaway. The gateway itself never runs inside
the slice, so slice pressure degrades agents, never the control plane.

The mechanism is deliberately root-free and stateless on disk: `systemctl --user
set-property --runtime kirocrew-agents.slice MemoryHigh=<N>M`, run by the unprivileged user
manager that owns the slice. `--runtime` keeps the drop-in under `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (it
vanishes with the login session), so no persistent unit files accumulate and a stale ceiling
never outlives the login session. Reconciliation before each scope wrap is a no-op string
compare in steady state. It shares the scope
wrapper's availability gate (`_probe_cgroup_scope`: Linux, cgroup v2, `memory` controller
delegated, systemd user session); where that gate fails, or `systemctl` itself fails, the
ceiling degrades to a no-op with **one loud SECURITY warning** and agent spawns proceed
uncontained at the slice level — per-scope `MemoryMax` still applies.

Throttling past `memory.high` is otherwise **silent**: agents just slow down, nothing kills,
and nothing alerts (per-scope `MemoryMax` never fired). To keep "agents mysteriously slow"
diagnosable as ceiling throttling rather than a hang, each reconcile also reads the slice
cgroup's `memory.events` and logs **one warning per climbing episode** of its `high` counter
(the kernel's count of subtree throttle-and-reclaim passes for the ceiling): the first
observed increase logs, further increases stay silent until the counter is seen stable, and
a counter that went *down* is a recreated slice cgroup and only re-baselines. The read is a
plain file read of the systemd user manager's cgroup subtree, shares the reconciler's
per-spawn cadence and kill switch, and degrades to a silent no-op wherever the file does not
exist (macOS/Windows, no cgroup v2, slice not materialized).

The kernel enforces both ceilings at `fork()` and allocation time, so there is no reaper
race. `--scope` execs into the target rather than forking a wrapper, so the gateway's PID
tracking, `killpg` and descendant scan are unaffected. It composes *outside* the OS-level
sandbox: a child is filesystem-isolated (namespace or seatbelt) **and** cgroup-bounded.
`test/test_spawn_audit.py` asserts every sandbox-routed spawn also applies the scope.

### The aggregate slice hard cap (`memory.max` and `TasksMax`)

`memory.max` is a **per-cgroup** limit and every scope is a sibling, so the per-scope
ceilings do not compose: N concurrent spawns may collectively request N × 65% of host RAM
with no single cgroup ever breaching its own limit — and `compute_max_subagents()` creates
exactly that concurrency (up to 32 subagents by default). cgroup v2 bounds a descendant by
the **minimum** effective limit of itself and all its ancestors, so the parent slice every
scope already nests under is the natural aggregate boundary.
`sandbox.ensure_agents_slice_limits()` puts a ceiling on it at gateway startup:

- **`MemoryMax`** plus **`MemorySwapMax=0`** on `kirocrew-agents.slice`, default **80% of
  physical RAM** (`_CGROUP_TOTAL_MEMORY_FRACTION`; 12288 MB fallback when RAM cannot be
  read; override via `resource_limits.max_total_memory_mb`). The fraction sits *above* the
  per-scope 65% — a slice tighter than one scope would silently shrink a single spawn's
  documented headroom — and below 100% so the OS and the gateway keep breathing room when
  agent work saturates the ceiling. The two memory knobs are deliberately independent:
  per-scope answers "how big may one tree get", aggregate answers "how much may all trees
  claim together".
- **`TasksMax`** on the slice, default **32768** (`_CGROUP_DEFAULT_MAX_TOTAL_TASKS`, four
  fully-loaded scopes' worth; override via `resource_limits.max_total_processes`). `pids.max`
  has the same sibling-composition problem (32 scopes × 8192 = 262144 tasks), so the slice
  carries it too.

The property is applied with `systemctl --user set-property --runtime`, chosen over a
shipped unit drop-in deliberately: the value is re-derived from config and re-applied on
every gateway start, so a config change never leaves a stale on-disk artifact, and an
uninstall leaves nothing behind. It shares `_probe_cgroup_scope()`'s availability gate with
the per-spawn wrapper — where delegation is missing, both layers are skipped under the same
single SECURITY warning.

A slice-level breach OOM-kills *some* scope inside the slice, and the kernel picks the
victim — not necessarily the spawn that grew. To keep that diagnosable,
`sandbox.check_agents_slice_pressure()` (polled from the resource-pressure sampler's worker
thread) logs new `oom_kill` events with the victim scopes (each scope's own
`memory.events.local`), the slice's `memory.current` versus `memory.max`, and whether the
slice's own ceiling engaged (`memory.events.local max` on the slice) — the discriminator
between an aggregate breach and a single scope hitting its own per-tree limit.

A **task** breach has no comparable kernel event to observe: past `pids.max` the kernel
fails `fork()` with `EAGAIN` in whichever scope asks next, logs nothing, and every agent
under that slice hits the same wall at once — the whole agent population of this user's
gateways, since the slice lives in the per-UID user manager, not the machine's other users.
What makes it observable is the count on the way up, so
`resource_status.probe()` reads the slice's `pids.current` against its `pids.max` and carries
three figures on its snapshot — the slice total, the ceiling, and this instance's own
child-slice share, read separately so an install is never credited with a co-resident
gateway's tasks. The reading reaches the `resource_status` pull tool and the diagnostics
bundle's posture block; past
`_SLICE_TASKS_TIGHT_RATIO` (90%) of the ceiling it also rides the injected `[RESOURCES]`
line, and raises that line by itself when memory is not the constraint — the case the memory
figure cannot express at all. Note the asymmetry with memory, which is deliberate: the task
figure is **reported, never gated**. `posture` stays a single memory scalar, so
`admission_check` and `prewarm_allowance` behave identically at any task count, and a
refusal keeps naming the GB reading an operator can act on. The dashboard's `/api/system`
payload deliberately does NOT carry these figures: nothing renders them yet, and the key
lands in the same change as its consumer rather than ahead of it.

Where there is no cgroup task ceiling to approach (macOS, Windows, no delegation) all three
figures read `-1`. The RENDERED surfaces then print nothing rather than an unknown —
`summary_lines()` drops its line and the `[RESOURCES]` advisory cannot be raised by a task
count at all — while the diagnostics bundle carries the `-1` sentinel through, because a
reader parsing fields needs the key present to tell "not measurable here" from a field this
gateway version does not serve. An absent ceiling and an unreadable one stay distinct:
`pids.max` holding the kernel's `max` sentinel reports `0` and prints "no ceiling set", while
a read that fails — a slice released between the directory check and the read — reports `-1`
and prints "ceiling unreadable", so a teardown is never published as an absent limit.

### Availability and fallback

The scope requires Linux with cgroup v2 delegation (the `pids` and `memory` controllers
delegated to the user slice) plus a systemd user session. Where that is unavailable (older
Linux without delegation, no user session, macOS), `cgroup_scope_argv` returns the argv
unchanged and logs a **one-time loud SECURITY warning**. `RLIMIT_NOFILE` still applies, but
the fork-bomb and memory ceilings are NOT enforced there. Operators on such hosts should run
the gateway under an externally-configured cgroup or container limit.

The user session half of that gate belongs to the user's login, not to the gateway process.
On a host without lingering, logind stops the per-user manager and removes `/run/user/<uid>`
and `user-<uid>.slice` when the last login session ends, while `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` stays set in
the gateway's environment. So `_probe_cgroup_scope` requires a bus socket that accepts a
non-blocking `connect()` (a stale socket file, or a seccomp/LSM policy refusing the connect,
is unavailable), and its cached answer is keyed on a stat-only fingerprint of the runtime
directory, the bus sockets and the user slice, re-checked at every spawn, with a 60-second TTL
behind it for a manager that died without removing its socket. A gateway that started inside
an SSH session therefore stops prepending `systemd-run` once the manager is gone, instead of
failing every spawn with `Failed to connect to bus`, and takes the same no-scope path a
gateway started after the logout takes; it bounds spawns again once the manager returns. Each
flip is logged, the loss as a SECURITY warning naming the remedy, `loginctl enable-linger
$USER`, which keeps the manager and the ceiling across logouts (it needs sudo on a managed
host such as a Cloud Desktop).

### macOS: a reaper, not a ceiling

macOS has containment of a different kind and strictly weaker guarantees, so the two must
not be confused for each other. What it has is the **orphan MCP reaper**
(`session_pid.kill_orphan_mcps`), which reclaims a launcher tree *after* it leaks. What it
does not have is any ceiling that stops one growing in the first place.

The reaper's fingerprint-less arm — the cmdlines a user's own shell could reproduce
(`npx @playwright/mcp`, `<launcher> mcp start-server <name>`) — demands positive identity
before it signals, and that identity is the process's exec-time `KIROCREW_SPAWNED` environ
entry. macOS reads it from `sysctl(CTL_KERN, KERN_PROCARGS2, pid)`
(`platform_compat.darwin_process_environ`), the record `ps -E` prints: same-uid only, no
entitlement, no elevated privilege, and a kernel copy fixed at exec, so it is evidence one
process cannot forge for another. The read is bounded at the kernel's `ARG_MAX` ceiling on
argv-plus-environment rather than the smaller bound the argv probe uses, because the
environment sits *after* argv in that one record — a launcher that appends to its own argv
on every generation would otherwise push its own environment out of the read and be refused
for want of identity. Windows has no comparable same-uid read and keeps failing closed.

Two residuals on macOS, both deliberate:

- The **descendant** walk under a reaped root stays a no-op there: it needs a per-pid parent
  edge and start identity from one atomic read (`_pid_parent_and_token`, `/proc`-only) and a
  NUL-separated argv (`_pid_cmdline`), and the `ps` fallback supplies neither. The root's
  `killpg` still reclaims everything sharing its process group; a member that `setsid`-ed
  away survives to a later sweep.
- The sweep's own floors (`_ORPHAN_MIN_AGE_SECONDS` 120s, `_ORPHAN_SWEEP_MAX_KILLS` 30) are
  sized for a leak, not a storm, and they are shared with every other sweep class.

**No bounded per-subtree process ceiling exists on macOS.** Checked, and why each candidate
is not one:

| Candidate | Why it is not a subtree ceiling |
|---|---|
| cgroup v2 `pids.max` | Linux-only; macOS has no cgroup equivalent at any version |
| `RLIMIT_NPROC` (`setrlimit`, `ulimit -u`) | Counted **per real UID**, not per spawn subtree, so a value low enough to bound one agent tree caps the operator's entire login session — and the Darwin kernel additionally clamps a non-root value to `kern.maxprocperuid` |
| `launchd` job `SoftResourceLimits`/`HardResourceLimits` → `NumberOfProcesses` | The same `RLIMIT_NPROC`, so the same per-UID problem; it also only reaches processes launchd itself started, and the gateway spawns its MCP servers directly |
| Seatbelt (`sandbox-exec`, `process-fork`) | The operation is deny-or-allow, not a counted budget: denying `fork` breaks every legitimate MCP server that spawns a child. Also a deprecated interface |
| Jetsam / `memorystatus_control` | Memory pressure, not process count, and per-process rather than per-subtree; the private interface needs an entitlement |
| `kqueue` `EVFILT_PROC` + `NOTE_TRACK` | Delivers fork events for a tracked subtree, so a supervisor could *count* — but enforcement would then be a userspace reaper racing a fork storm, which is the race this section exists to describe, not a ceiling. `NOTE_TRACK` can also fail to attach (`NOTE_TRACKERR`) |

So on macOS the honest position is: a fork storm is reclaimed after the fact, on the sweep's
cadence, and is not prevented. Operators who need prevention should run the gateway inside a
Linux VM or container where the cgroup scope applies.

### Bus locators are part of the wrapper contract, and only the wrapper's

`systemd-run --user` reaches the user session bus via `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` and
`DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`, so those must be present in the environment the spawn is created
with, not merely the gateway's. That environment is credential-scrubbed, and some callers
(`dashboard/source_providers/runner.py` builds it from a strict allowlist rather than
inheriting `os.environ`), so `sandboxed_spawn_argv` restores the two keys via
`cgroup_scope_bus_env()` after the scrub, gated on the same availability probe that decides
whether to wrap at all. Omitting them does not degrade to an unbounded spawn, it fails the
spawn outright: `systemd-run` exits 1 with `Failed to connect to bus: No medium found`
before exec'ing the wrapped command.

They must not survive into the sandboxed child, however. A live user-bus address inside the
sandbox can be used to ask the user systemd manager to start a unit that runs *outside* the
namespace. So the forward is paired with an `env -u XDG_RUNTIME_DIR -u
DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS` shim placed inside the scope, immediately after `--`, which drops
exactly the keys this layer added; a value the caller supplied itself is left alone. `env`
`exec`s in place, so PID tracking, `killpg` and descendant scans are unaffected. It is
resolved from an absolute path, never a caller-influenced `PATH`, and when no `env` binary
exists the layer **fails closed**: the locators are not forwarded at all, so the wrapper
fails loudly rather than handing the child a reachable bus.

## Memory-aware cap for pytest-xdist `-n auto`

> **Two compositions of one Mach struct, on purpose.** `subagent._macos_vm_reclaimable_pages`
> and `platform_compat.host_available_mib` both read `host_statistics64`, and they sum its
> page counters differently. The budget's version is tighter — it does not re-add

pytest-xdist resolves `-n auto` to the CPU count and never looks at memory, so on a
many-core host a full-suite run inside an agent turn spawns one worker per core at roughly
1 GB each — and two agent sessions doing it concurrently can exhaust an unswapped host
before either cgroup ceiling helps (the per-scope ceiling is per-spawn-tree, and the
slice's aggregate ceiling OOM-kills rather than throttles). xdist honors the
[`PYTEST_XDIST_AUTO_NUM_WORKERS`](https://pytest-xdist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/distribution.html)
environment variable when resolving `auto`, so both agent spawn boundaries
(`acp/client.py` and `acp/runtime.py`) seed it via
`resource_status.inject_xdist_auto_cap()`:
`min(cpu_count, floor(available_gb * 0.5 / 1.0))`, floored at 1, computed from the same
cgroup-clamped memory probe the advisory `resource_status` tool uses. Half of the
*currently available* memory, so two sessions sizing themselves at the same instant cannot
jointly commit more than what was free. This shapes **only** `auto`/`logical` resolution:
explicit `-n N`, non-xdist runs, and venvs without xdist installed are untouched, and a
value already present in the environment is never overridden. Configured via
`resource_limits.xdist_auto_cap`: `-1` (default) auto-computes, `0` disables the injection
entirely, `N > 0` pins a fixed worker cap.

In **this repo's own** test suite the variable is read by the worker budget in the
rootdir `conftest.py` rather than by xdist, and it is honoured as a **ceiling** —
tightened further by that budget's own memory readings, never loosened. The hook is
`firstresult`, and a conftest implementation outranks a plugin one, so this hook runs
*instead of* xdist's default; reading the variable there is what stops an injected cap
being silently discarded. An agent-spawned run therefore gets the tighter of the two
budgets. Anywhere else — a venv that merely has xdist installed — xdist reads it
itself and the injection works as described above.

## Known gaps

1. **`agent.subagent_timeout_secs` is not settable from the dashboard.** The knob is
   clamped at load like the other resource dimensions, but the config PUT allowlist
   still covers only the turn budget and the concurrency caps, so raising the subagent
   deadline needs the CLI or a `config.json` edit.

2. **`cleanup_orphaned_sessions` only runs at startup and shutdown.** If a session's process
   dies mid-run without triggering `AcpProcessDied` (an OOM kill, for instance), the PID
   stays in `kiro_pids.txt` until the next gateway restart. The periodic
   `_cleanup_orphaned_mcp_servers` sweep catches MCP children but not the root kiro-cli
   process.

3. **cgroup enforcement depends on cgroup v2 delegation being present.** Where it is
   missing (older Linux, no systemd user session, macOS), neither the per-scope ceilings
   nor the aggregate slice throttle and hard cap apply. The load-time config clamp bounds process
   *counts* (subagent count, turn budget, pool size), not memory or CPU. The slice's
   runtime property is dropped when the user manager restarts (logout/reboot); the
   resource-pressure sampler detects the vanished ceiling on its next tick and
   re-applies it, so the unprotected window is at most one sample interval — but only
   on hosts where the gateway applied it in the first place.

4. **The xdist auto-cap is snapshotted at session spawn, not at test-run time.** Agent
   sessions are long-lived: a session spawned while memory was ample carries its generous
   `PYTEST_XDIST_AUTO_NUM_WORKERS` for its whole lifetime, so a suite launched hours later
   under pressure still gets the stale cap — and conversely, a session spawned under
   transient pressure stays throttled after the pressure clears. The "two sessions cannot
   jointly over-commit" property holds at *spawn* instant only. Refreshing the value at
   command-execution time (a pre-tool-use boundary rather than process birth) is the
   planned follow-up.

## Interaction notes

- **The reaper's `reaped` flag prevents double cleanup.** When the reaper force-kills a
  subagent it sets `info.reaped = True`. `_run()`'s `CancelledError` handler and `finally`
  block check the flag and skip their own cleanup (release, reset, decrement, announce) to
  avoid double side effects. The cron reaper uses the same pattern: the `_reaped_jobs` set
  prevents `_run_job_isolated` from merging a stale result after the reaper has already
  updated job state.

- **`asyncio.shield` in the task runner protects cleanup from cancellation.** When a task run
  is cancelled, `_cleanup_run_sessions` is wrapped in `asyncio.shield()` so session resets
  complete even if the parent task is cancelled, which is what prevents orphaned processes.

- **The circuit breaker and context compaction are complementary.** The circuit breaker
  handles repeated failures (a broken session), while compaction handles context-window
  exhaustion (a healthy session that has been running a long time). Both trigger a session
  reset, for different reasons.

- **Idle expiry and `_cleanup_orphaned_mcp_servers` run on the same loop.** `_cleanup_loop`
  in `session.py` runs every ~5 min (timeout/6, minimum 60s) and performs both idle session
  expiry and orphaned MCP server cleanup in the same iteration.

- **The ACP read timeout is what enables cooperative cancellation.** The 20s `_READ_TIMEOUT`
  on each `readline()` in the prompt loop ensures `CancelledError` can be delivered at every
  yield point, which is what makes the reaper's `task.cancel()` effective.

- **The periodic sweep's active set unions live shared-runtime PIDs.** Every `AcpRuntime`
  records its PID at spawn, so the orphan sweep would SIGKILL any tracked PID missing from
  the active set (surfacing as `process exited (rc=-9)` mid-chat). Two runtime kinds live
  outside `self._sessions` and are invisible to `_collect_active_pids`: companion subagent
  runtimes (`_subagent_runtimes`, alive for the parent's whole lifetime) and the background
  `kirocrew-lite` runtime (`_bg_runtime`). The sweep unions
  `SessionManager._companion_runtime_pids()` into the active set in both the
  candidate-collection and the phase-2 re-check passes, so live shared runtimes are never
  swept. Only alive runtimes contribute, because a dead entry SHOULD be reaped.

- **Long-lived pool sessions are shielded from the sweep by an explicit PID registration.**
  Pool workers are long-lived agent sessions the sweep cannot see via
  `_collect_active_pids`, so without a shield it would SIGKILL a *busy* worker mid-task.
  Three shields, one mechanism (`register_protected_pid` / `unregister_protected_pid` in
  `session_pid.py`): the shared `WorkerPool` engine (`acp/worker_pool.py`) registers each
  worker's PID as part of the worker lifecycle and re-syncs it on every `reset()` (which
  respawns under a new PID), so any pool built on it (`workflows/agent_pool.py`) is
  protected by construction; the knowledge `LLMPool` worker (`AcpWorker`,
  `knowledge/llm_pool.py`) registers inline because it does not ride that engine; and
  `AcpRuntime` (`acp/runtime.py`) registers at spawn, which covers the code-review-sage
  `ReviewPool` (`apps/builtins/code_review_sage/sage_lib/review_pool.py`), whose
  `_BatchRuntimeHolder` multiplexes every concurrent review onto ONE batch-scoped
  `AcpRuntime` rather than a pool of subprocesses.

- **Browser-triggerable filesystem work runs on an isolated pool.** Dashboard list
  endpoints (`GET /api/skills`, `/api/agents/installed`, `/api/prompts`, plus the themes,
  steering and prompt readers) do `os.walk`-style filesystem discovery on the dedicated
  `discovery_executor` pool (`executors.py`), kept separate from the reaper-critical
  `maintenance_executor` so a burst of concurrent user-triggered scans can never starve the
  orphan sweeps. The prompt WRITE handlers (`POST /api/prompts`,
  `PUT`/`DELETE /api/prompts/{name}`) use the same pool for the same reason: directory
  resolution, the link check, and the write itself all touch the filesystem, and on a
  network-mounted home that is a multi-second stall the event loop must not take.
