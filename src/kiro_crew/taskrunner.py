    so every name-based check passes while the bytes belong to the target. The
    read therefore goes through ``hooks.safe_read_file_bytes_nolink``: it opens
    FIRST (refusing a link at the final component), ``fstat``s that one
    descriptor and refuses ``st_nlink > 1``, a non-regular inode, and a sensitive
    or out-of-root real path, then reads that same descriptor. ``within_root`` is
    the spec's own directory, which also pins the opened inode on Windows where
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` does not exist.

    ``max_chars`` asks for a bounded prefix, cut to fit. ``None`` asks for the
    whole spec, bounded by the gate's own ``hooks.MAX_FILE_BYTES``, where a file
    past that cap raises ``hooks.FileTooLargeError`` instead of yielding a silent
    prefix.

    Returns ``None`` for anything the gate refuses or cannot read. Every spec

        Async, and both halves are offloaded: each writes a SEL event, and arming
        additionally consults the ``approval_modes`` policy. Both callers are async
        methods, so running either inline put that filesystem work on the gateway's
        event loop.

        The flag is set FROM the activation result, never ahead of it. Arming can
        now be refused -- an ``approval_modes`` deny of ``yolo`` disables scoped
        grants too -- and assigning the flag first meant a refused arm still
        persisted and reported ``auto_approve: True`` with no authoritative grant
        behind it. That is the exact divergence this function exists to prevent,
        so the refusal has to reach the flag.
