"""Security-posture detail registry — the data behind Settings → Security.

Every count in this module is DERIVED from the live control it describes — never
a hardcoded number that can drift out of sync with what it covers — and each
control also resolves its concrete ``items`` so the dashboard can expand a row
into the real list instead of asking the reader to trust a pill.

Design contract:

- **Derived where a live list exists.** A count is always ``len(items)``, so the
  pill and the expanded list can never disagree. Seven controls resolve their
  items straight from the enforcing object (``sensitive_home_dirs()``,
  ``write_protected_home_paths()``, ``BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES``,
  ``SUSPICIOUS_BASH_PATTERNS``, the MCP dispatch registries, ``exfil_query_min_len()``,
  ``sel.audit_sources()``) — for those, drift is structurally impossible.
- **Three controls are curated, and are guarded by inverse tests.**
  ``_REDACTION_SINKS``, ``_CREDENTIAL_FAMILIES``, and ``_EXFIL_HEURISTICS`` have no
  single live list to enumerate (a redaction sink is a *call site*, a credential
  family is a *regex alternative*, a heuristic is a *branch*). Deriving a count
  from ``len()`` of a hand-written tuple would just relocate the original
  stale-number bug into this module, so each is paired with an
  **omission-detecting** test: the redaction registry is checked against every
  redactor call site in the package (with an explicit
  ``NON_EGRESS_REDACTION_MODULES`` allowlist), and the family/heuristic lists are
  checked against the live scanners. An omission — a curated list silently
  missing an entry — is the failure mode here, and only a test that
  detects an omission
  catches it, and a `len()` assertion never will.
- **Posture, not secrets.** Every item here is either a *public* control
  definition (a path pattern the agent is blocked from, a redaction sink's
  module, a credential FAMILY name) or a derived count. This endpoint never
  emits credential material, policy/profile rule CONTENTS (the governance
  ceiling the agent is fenced from — see ``handlers/security.py``'s posture-only
  snapshot), or user data. Sensitive-path entries are the *blocklist* itself,
  which is already documented in ``docs/architecture/security-deep-dive.md`` and is not a
  secret: knowing ``~/.aws`` is blocked does not help reach it.
- **One registry, two readers.** The dashboard renders it; ``test_security_posture``
  pins the derivation so a control that grows without its detail entry fails CI.

Redaction sinks are *named* in ``_REDACTION_SINKS`` rather than counted straight
from call sites, because a raw ``grep`` count would count comments, internal
non-egress uses, and every refactor. But the list is not trusted on its own: the
drift guard walks every redactor call site in the package and requires each
module to be either a registered sink or an explicitly-reasoned entry in
``NON_EGRESS_REDACTION_MODULES``. So the count means "egress paths covered" AND
cannot silently omit one.
