    This is the layer a distribution owns: an edition that wants its known
    servers stubbed out of the box ships them here, and keeps shipping them as
    the roster grows. Operator deviations live in ``stub_overrides`` and are
    applied over this by :func:`_resolve_stub_servers` — which is what lets the
    two move independently. Read this directly ONLY to answer "what does the
    roster say"; everything that wants the set actually in effect wants
    :func:`_resolve_stub_servers`.

    ``poolable_servers`` is the deprecated spelling and is consulted ONLY when
    ``stub_servers`` is absent from the file. Key presence, not truthiness, is
    the test: an operator who wrote ``stub_servers: []`` chose to stub nothing,
    and silently falling back to a stale ``poolable_servers`` would re-stub
    servers they had just cleared.

    The migration reproduces the stub set the operator was ALREADY RUNNING, which
    is why it is also conditional on ``enabled``. Before the stub became its own
    per-server decision, the broker was gated on ``enabled`` alone, so a config
    with ``enabled: false`` produced no broker, no overlay and no stub no matter
    what ``poolable_servers`` held. Migrating that list unconditionally would
    hand such an install a daemon and a stub process per server on upgrade —
    inventing the very topology change this design exists to make optional. An
