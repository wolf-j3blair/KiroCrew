"""Configuration section DTOs, defaults, and field-level coercion.

This module owns the sections other specs and tests anchor here: the agent,
crew-record, workspace, session, dashboard (with its tailnet sub-section),
channel, speech-to-text, telemetry, decisions and resource-limit DTOs. It also
re-exports every name of the domain owners it composes: ``config.fields`` (field
metadata and primitive coercion), ``config.memory_sections``,
``config.integration_sections`` and ``config.service_sections``.

The loader imports and re-exports this module's names as its compatibility

validation modules, and the owners it re-exports never import it.

# there is no config file) and the dict-load fallback in ``load()`` (used when
# a config file omits the key). Restating the number in both lets them disagree
# with nothing on disk to show it, which is why ``pool_size`` is named the same

DEFAULT_AUTOCOMPACT_PCT = 70.0
# Margin BELOW the configured compaction threshold at which the "context is
# getting large" warning fires. A margin rather than an absolute percentage
# because both consumers test compaction FIRST in an if/elif chain

# absolute warn level at or above the configured threshold makes the warning arm
# unreachable and the early signal disappears for whoever did not change the
# default. Kept here rather than in either consumer so the two cannot drift.
#
# 10 points, so the warning carries one fixed meaning — "within 10 points of
# compaction" — whatever threshold the operator configures. Width is what makes
# the signal readable: at 20 the warning covers the top 20 of the 70 usable
# points on the default threshold and fires on every turn from half the context
# window onward, which is where an always-on warning stops being read.

# a quarter of the range so it cannot widen back into noise.

# sizes the TaskRunner's auto parallel cap
# (subagent.compute_memory_sized_parallel_cap), so the cost is paid on every host
# whether or not the pool is ever claimed. Cold start is instead
# hidden by session.eager_spawn, which is on by default and pre-creates a slot's
# session behind user think-time.
#
# Read by BOTH the SessionConfig field default and load()'s file-parse fallback,
# because those are two independent paths to the same value: a home with no
# config.json takes the field default, and a config.json that omits the key takes
# the parse fallback. A literal in either place lets the two disagree, which is

# Per-session process-tree RSS ceiling (MiB) the cleanup watchdog recycles an

# tell a leak from a healthy session that loads many MCP servers. An agent with
# six MCP servers measured ~1.4 GB of tree RSS thirteen seconds after start, so
# the old 1536 default recycled ordinary sessions after one heavy turn. An

# session.reconcile_max_kills — root candidates the runtime reconciler may signal

# value, which makes the knob purely SUBTRACTIVE -- it can withhold signals and
# cannot authorize any the product does not already authorize.
#
# Subtractive on purpose, because the value governs host-side signals and
# ``config.json`` is agent-writable and never passes the dashboard's write gate. A
# knob whose reachable range sat above the shipped default would let a write turn
# killing up; this one cannot.
#
# An operator needs to turn it DOWN because the arm's evidence of abandonment is
# "no record on this data home claims this pid", and that evidence is only as wide
# as the records one process can read. The agent slice is named from a hash of the
# config directory, so every install sharing a data home shares the slice, and a
# runtime whose owner is a different process is claimed only by records that
# process holds. Measured on such a host: 250-504 unowned pids per pass against 4
# genuine strays in 6.5 hours. Setting 0 takes the reading without the signal.

      storing ``{}``. ``motions`` picks a built-in reaction animation per state
      from :data:`_AVATAR_MOTIONS`; ``sounds`` picks a synthesized preset cue per
      state from :data:`_AVATAR_SOUNDS`; ``expressions`` (a per-state eyes/mouth
      pick, which ``motions`` supersedes) still round-trips because the shipped
      renderer still draws it -- see :func:`_safe_expressions`.
    - ``{"kind": "image"}`` (optional int ``v``, optional ``file``, optional
      ``sounds``) — the crew wears an uploaded picture, served from
      ``GET /api/agents/{name}/avatar``. A picture has no animation to play, so it
      carries no ``motions``; it does still carry a cue, because the shipped
      renderer plays a crew's cue whatever face it wears, and dropping the key
      here would silence a crew on an unrelated save with no way to restore it.
      The file itself lives under the data home's agent-fenced ``run/avatars/``
      dir; the config field only marks the choice. ``v`` is the upload's cache-busting stamp (file
      mtime, nanoseconds): the frontend appends it as ``?v=`` so a replaced
      picture is re-fetched without waiting out the browser cache. ``file`` pins
      the exact committed file — a ``<digest>.<ext>`` suffix under the crew's
      stem. Every install lands at a digest-named path, so a replacement never
      overwrites the committed file before the config save commits it, and
      serving resolves only the pinned file.
    - ``{"kind": "pack", "id": "<pack id>"}`` — the crew wears an appearance
      pack from the crew library (``GET /api/appearances``). ``id`` is
      validated by :func:`kiro_crew.appearance_packs.safe_pack_id`, the same
      rule the pack store applies to a directory name, so a value stored here
      can always be looked up. A junk id collapses the WHOLE override to
      ``{}``: an unrenderable pack reference is worse than the default face.
      Whether the pack still EXISTS is deliberately not checked — config load
      must not touch the disk — so a dangling id renders as the name-derived
      ghost on the client. A pack carries its own per-state art
      (``GET /api/appearances/{id}/slot/{slot}``) and its own per-state audio
      (``GET /api/appearances/{id}/sound/{state}``), so it needs no ``motions``
      here. It keeps accepting ``sounds`` for now, for the same reason the picture
      tier does: the shipped renderer plays a crew-record cue on every tier, so
      retiring the key before that renderer stops reading it would take away a
      sound the user chose. Once the pack's own audio is what plays, the crew
      record has no cue to hold and the key retires with that change.

    ``<state>`` is one of ``working``, ``done``, ``error``. A key is omitted
    from the record when validation leaves it empty, so a stored avatar never
    carries ``{}`` for one, and a key illegal on this tier is DROPPED rather
    than refused — the same forgiveness every other field here has, because a
    hand-written or version-skewed record must not cost the crew its face. Two
    keys are deliberately NOT retired that way even though ``motions`` supersedes
    one of them: ``sounds`` is audible on every tier today, and a ghost's
    ``expressions`` is drawn today, and a value a user can see or hear is not
    dropped ahead of the renderer that shows it. ``expressions`` round-trips on
    picture and pack too, even though neither has a face to move: the shipped
    builder still SUBMITS it there, and a crew that switches from ghost to
    picture and back would otherwise lose the picks in between. Only ``motions``
    is tier-gated, because nothing has ever written it outside the ghost.

    Empty means "no override" — the frontend keeps rendering the name-seeded
    face. config.json is hand-editable (and agent-writable), so junk collapses
    to ``{}`` rather than crashing the load.

    Trait *values* are deliberately not checked against the frontend's trait
    vocabulary: the renderer resolves an unknown option to "absent"
    (``EYES[k] ?? ''``), and keeping the vocabulary in one place (the style
    module) means a new hat needs no backend release. ``tile`` is the one
    exception — it is interpolated into SVG markup, so it is pinned to a hex
    color by the same validator session_color uses. A motion or cue name is
    pinned, because unlike a trait it names an animation or a synthesizer
    preset rather than an option a renderer can resolve to nothing.

    Two rules, both narrowing-only so a typo can never widen access:

    * ``trust_identity: true`` with an empty ``allowed_logins`` is a
      configuration error — refused with a logged reason, identity trust stays
      OFF. Never a silently-permissive default: "any tailnet member" on a
      shared corporate tailnet would hand the dashboard to all of them.
    * An unrecognised ``pin_scope`` falls back to ``"node"`` (the narrower
      scope) with a logged warning — never to ``"login"``.

    Both rules resolve to a *narrower* value, which is right for an operator
    typo and wrong for a value that was LOST: ``allowed_logins`` is the only
    restriction on which tailnet peer may authenticate, so losing it resolves
    to "identity trust off", i.e. no login restriction at all. Absent is
    genuinely unconfigured; MALFORMED is the operator having asked for a
    restriction this load cannot read, and it is recorded in *degraded* under
    :data:`DEGRADED_TAILSCALE` so the gate can deny instead of admitting every
    tailnet peer (the shape that reopens the publish allowlist).

    ``key_present`` separates the two states a bare value cannot: a MISSING
    ``tailscale`` key and one written as JSON ``null`` both arrive here as
    ``None``. Only the second is the operator having written something, so only
    it degrades -- reading ``None`` alone as malformed would deny every install
    that simply has no tailscale section. Callers that do not know pass nothing

# config API (``dashboard/handlers/core.py`` for the agent knobs,
# ``session.py`` for ``pool_size``); they live HERE so the API-write gate and
# the loader's load-time clamp cannot drift apart.
#
# Why the loader must also clamp: the
# REST API rejects out-of-range writes, but a direct edit of ``config.json``
# (any process running as the same OS user — including a prompt-injected agent
# with file-write access) bypassed that gate entirely. Each of these knobs
# controls a resource-consumption dimension — concurrent subagent processes
# (each a separate kiro-cli process), per-agent turn budget (unbounded LLM
# calls + context growth), and pre-warmed pool processes spawned at startup —
# so an inflated on-disk value can exhaust host memory / CPU / the process
# table (denial of service). Clamping at load time makes the on-disk value
# untrusted above range no matter which consumer reads it, and also means the
# GET /api/config/kirocrew response (which serializes a freshly loaded config)
# reports the clamped value rather than the tampered one.

# transport's per-prompt wait follows this value (acp/client.py
# ``resolve_prompt_timeout``, which adds a margin so the dashboard's visible
# card fires before the transport cut), so the max is not pinned to the
# transport's default. The default is 4h: the longest single turn the shipped
# budgets can legitimately produce is a 90-minute test command plus a fix and a
# re-run, or a blocking subagent wave at its 2h wait cap plus synthesis, and
# the watchdog's UNKNOWN-verdict windows must sit well inside the ceiling so its
# non-lethal recovery is reachable before the turn is cut. It is bounded at 24h
# because the ceiling is a runaway backstop, not a scheduler: a single
# prompt→response turn longer than a day is pathological, and multi-day
# unattended operation belongs to the loop mechanisms (monitor/goal loops,

# a lower value recreates the session-start race the dedicated budget exists to

    the rlimit path, ``_CGROUP_DEFAULT_*`` for the cgroup paths), and those must
    stay where they are rather than being copied into this dataclass as a third
    default set.

    The coercion rules, and why each one is what it is:

    - ``bool`` is not a number here. ``True`` would otherwise coerce to ``1`` and
      set a one-process / one-MB ceiling, which kills the child it limits.
    - A non-integral float TRUNCATES toward zero (``512.5`` -> ``512``), matching
      what every pre-existing reader did, so tightening the parse cannot loosen
      an operator's ceiling.
    - EXCEPT when it truncates to ``0``, either sign: ``0.5`` is not a request to
      disable the limit, but ``int(0.5)`` is exactly the value that means
      "disabled" on the rlimit path and "use the default" on the cgroup path.
      That silent reinterpretation is the trap, so it is refused.
    - NaN and +/-Infinity are refused before ``int()`` sees them. ``json.loads``
      accepts both literals, and ``int(inf)`` raises ``OverflowError`` --
      uncaught on the rlimit path, which turned a typo into a failure of every

class ResourceLimitsConfig:
    """Kernel confinement ceilings for spawned agent processes.

    THREE mechanisms read this one block, and a key shared between two of them
    does NOT mean the same thing on both. That is the whole reason this section
    has a schema: without it every consumer parses the raw dict itself, leaving
    the incompatible domains written down nowhere and free to drift apart.

    - ``POSIX rlimits`` (``security.apply_resource_limits``, via ``preexec_fn``
      or the exec shim's ``--rlimits=``). Here ``0`` is a MEANINGFUL, documented
      value: "leave the inherited limit unchanged". Absent falls back to
      ``security._RLIMIT_DEFAULTS``.
    - ``cgroup v2 scope`` (``sandbox.cgroup_scope_argv``, ``TasksMax`` /
      ``MemoryMax`` / ``CPUWeight`` on a transient ``systemd-run --user
      --scope``). Here ``0`` is ILLEGAL -- systemd rejects the property and the
      scope never starts -- so ``0``, absent, or anything out of domain falls
      back to the module default and the ceiling is never left unset. The one
      exception is ``max_cpu_percent``, which is opt-in: unset emits no
      ``CPUQuota`` property at all.
    - ``pytest-xdist worker cap`` (``resource_status``), where ``xdist_auto_cap``
      carries its own three-way sentinel.

    Every field is ``int | None``, and ``None`` means "not configured" -- kept
    distinct from ``0`` precisely because ``0`` is a real value on the rlimit
    path. Values are coerced by :func:`_limit_int`, the ONLY parse site for this
    block; a second one is a defect, and ``test_resource_limits_schema.py``
    fails if one appears.
