"""push_guard.py - stale-base guard and commit builder for the kirocrew-prepare-pr skill.

The default mode verifies that HEAD is safe to force-push by checking:
0. Nothing is staged in this checkout that HEAD lacks (exit 41).
1. The fetch of origin/<base> succeeds (fail closed on network error).
2. origin/<base> is an ancestor of HEAD (i.e. HEAD sits on the freshly
   fetched base tip, not on a stale fork point that would cause the squash
   to bake in reversions of newer base changes).
3. The number of commits HEAD is ahead of origin/<base> is plausibly small
   (default threshold: 5 commits for a single-commit PR workflow; configurable
   via --max-ahead).
4. None of the ahead-commits are patch-equivalent to commits in a bounded
   window (REPLAY_HISTORY_WINDOW) of origin/<base> history.  Comparison uses
   `git patch-id --stable` so renames, whitespace, and commit metadata are
   ignored — only the semantic diff matters.  The window is bounded because
   full history is unbounded cost, and replayed commits from a recent stale
   fork are by construction recent.
5. Every path HEAD changes against origin/<base> was committed on this branch
   by this script (the build record), is published by another author's
   commit on the pushed branch, or is one you vouch for by naming it after
   ``--`` (read-only).

This prevents the catastrophic failure mode where a worktree branched from a
local integration trunk (kiki-trunk) carries 100+ unshipped commits that get
force-pushed to the remote feature branch, clobbering upstream work.

The other modes make the flow's commits, so none of them is built from paths
someone else staged (references/rationale.md):
--commit -m MSG -- PATH...     commit exactly the named paths (-F FILE for the
                               message from a file).
--amend [-m MSG] -- [PATH...]  the same, amending HEAD.
--squash [MESSAGE_FILE] [-- PATH...]
                               checks 0-5 (PATH... vouches for paths the record
                               lacks), then one commit of HEAD's TREE on
                               origin/<base>, made with commit-tree and moved
                               onto the branch by one compare-and-swap.
--require-single-on-base [-- PATH...]
                               after the fetch: HEAD's only parent is
                               origin/<base>, and check 5 holds.
--check-index                  report what is staged here, and why.

A PATH is relative to this directory, or ``:(top,literal)PATH`` from the top
(the form refusals print); --paths-from-file FILE adds a refusal's
NUL-separated list.

Every revision is the fully qualified refs/remotes/origin/<base> the fetch
writes.  A git command that fails or outlives its bound refuses with a message
naming it — never SAFE, and never a guessed cause.

Portable: stdlib only (Python 3.9+); shells out to git via argument lists.
