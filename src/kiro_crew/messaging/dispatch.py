"""Shared channel turn pipeline — one copy of the dispatch skeleton.

This module owns the sequence every non-Slack channel dispatcher runs around
:class:`TurnDriver`:

    governance gate
    -> hook auto-reply                   (HOOK_REPLY short-circuits, no session)
    -> renderer.on_turn_start()          (typing indicator before cold start)
    -> sessions.get_or_create + set_channel
    -> publish_turn_identity
    -> ctx_builder.build_message         (off-loop, embeds block)
    -> TurnDriver.run                    (shared redaction + approval ladder)
    -> COMPACTION_FAILED: reset; replay once more if the failure was transient
                                         and nothing was emitted (bounded)
    -> post-turn: record_success, persist, threshold notice, SEL audit
                                         (each guarded independently)
    -> finally: renderer.close() + release (release gated on acquire)

What stays per-channel is what actually differs between them: the wire
protocol, event normalization, ``authorize()`` semantics, rendering, command
vocabulary, and the ack strings. Channels inject those through
:class:`ChannelTurn` rather than subclassing, so a capability this protocol
lacks widens the protocol once instead of forking the pipeline.

Dependency direction is ``<channel> -> messaging`` (never the reverse), so this
module must not import any channel package.

    ``crew_log_emit.on_session_opened`` is what CREATES a session's crew log, keyed
    by its ACP session id; ``chat_runner._run_chat`` calls it on every dashboard turn
    once the handle exists, and a warm reuse is silent. A channel conversation runs
    its own copy of the turn loop, and without this call it opens no log at all.
    That is a hole the work ledger falls into: the ledger is a projection of the
    crew log, every ``work_ledger_record`` / ``work_report`` write appends one
    ``work/recorded`` entry to the ACTING session's log, and a write with nowhere
    to append is rolled back and refused (``crew_log_unrecorded``). An owner DM
    that session control admits as a conductor therefore reached the ledger and
    lost every write to it. Opening the log here, before ``TurnDriver.run``, is
    what makes that admission usable. Free while the emitter is off -- the emitter
    checks its own flag -- and it never raises, because the turn must not be lost
    to its own record.

    Only facts the dispatcher can establish are recorded; the emitter reads an
    absent field as "not observed", never as false. The ACP session id comes off
    *provider* (no id, no log: a turn that never got a session emits nothing, as
    on the dashboard). ``slot`` is the key the dashboard surfaces this conversation
    under -- the channel key folded to the filename charset, which is what
    ``channel_slot_name`` spells and what ``session_create`` stamps as
    ``_created_by`` on the workers this session dispatches, so the session tree
    joins the two. The served model and the cwd are read off the provider, the
    dashboard's own sources for them, and ``model_requested`` is the allocation's
    stamp of what was SELECTED (:func:`requested_model_sid`, read after the claim
    like the predecessor) -- the pair the entry records, since a call handed
    ``model=None`` has the allocation resolve the id itself and nothing else can
    say what it chose; ``resumed`` is ``get_or_create``'s answer.
    The class is stated only when the memory mode is known, from the gateway's
    live policy for the key (``ctx_builder.live_memory_mode_for_session``, wired by
    the dashboard state; a builder without it states no class, which readers
    refuse rather than assume), and it carries ``channel=True`` because a
    channel-born conversation is published to its channel by definition -- the
    same reading ``_crew_log_class`` takes off a linked slot. ``workspace`` is
    stated the way the dashboard writer states it, off the slot the dashboard
    surfaces this conversation under (:func:`slot_workspace`), because a tab on
    the conversation writes into this same log and the emitter records a
    ``session/class`` move whenever two statements of one session's class differ:
    every member the dashboard states, this opener states from the same source, or
    the two writers would take turns recording a move that never happened. No
    ``parent``: a
    conversation the person opened themselves is nobody's child. ``previous_sid``
    is the crew log this conversation's live session superseded, as the
    allocation boundary captured it while registering that session
    (:func:`predecessor_sid`, consumed by the dispatcher right after
    ``get_or_create`` returns): the emitter writes the ``previous`` edge only when
    it creates a log that names a different store, which is what keeps a
    conversation's history reachable across the cold successor a failed
    compaction leaves behind.

    For the channel's OWN sessions only. A dashboard session resumed into the chat
    (``!sessions``) is opened by the dashboard runner, which alone holds its

    A turn abandoned after a transient compaction failure is replayed INSIDE the
    same ``drive_turn`` call, into the same renderer: the shared pipeline has no
    queue of its own to put the message back on (five of the seven channels
    riding it keep none), and the channel's renderer is one message's output
    surface that finalizes on its first DONE -- so a completion delivered for
    the abandoned attempt would close the reply before the replay could write
    it. This guard therefore holds that one DONE back, and only that one:

    * the completion must be ``STOP_REASON_COMPACTION_FAILED``;
    * nothing may have been emitted through the guard this turn -- verbatim
      replay is only safe before any text, tool call or permission prompt has
      landed, exactly the guard the dashboard's transient siblings use. A
      consumed mid-turn steer counts too: the backend folded a correction the
      replayed ``user_text`` does not carry, so re-running the original prompt
      would silently discard what the user was told was accepted;
    * the provider must report ``last_compaction_transient`` as ``True`` --
      compared against ``True``, not read for truthiness, so a provider that
      never set the attribute (or exposes an auto-created stand-in for it)
      cannot read as transient by accident;
    * a retry must still be available.

    Every other event passes straight through, and a held DONE is released
    (``release_held``) when the pipeline decides not to replay after all.

    Whole events are forwarded through the inner renderer's own ``dispatch``
    rather than routed to its ``on_*`` handlers from here, so the bookkeeping
    that method does on the way (``current_tool_name``) lands on the object
    whose handlers read it. The ``on_*`` delegates below exist because the
    contract declares them abstract; the driver itself reaches its renderer
    through ``dispatch`` and ``on_turn_start`` only.
