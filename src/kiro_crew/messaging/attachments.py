"""Channel-neutral inbound attachment ingestion.

Every chat channel receives files in its own envelope shape and fetches them with
its own auth, but what happens *after* the bytes land is identical: classify,
enforce limits, convert to something the model can actually consume, redact,
audit, and clean up. This module owns that shared half so each channel only
supplies metadata plus a download callback.

Terminal form per class -- there is no single pipe, because each class reaches
the model differently:

===========  =========================================================
class        becomes
===========  =========================================================
IMAGE        a local path the ACP prompt path inlines as an image block
             (see :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.prompt_blocks`)
TEXT         redacted, truncated text inlined into the prompt
DOCUMENT     text extracted via :mod:`kiro_crew.doc_parser`, then as TEXT
AUDIO        a local path for the caller to transcribe (opt-in)
VIDEO        complete temporary file + path metadata for agent tools
OTHER        complete temporary file + path metadata for agent tools
===========  =========================================================

**Why rejections are returned rather than swallowed.** Silently dropping an
attachment is the original defect this module exists to fix: a user posts a file
and the reply simply ignores it, with no explanation. Callers are expected to
surface :attr:`IngestResult.rejections` to the user.

**Deliberately NOT here: the fetch itself.** Host allowlisting and auth are
channel-specific -- Slack needs a bearer token against ``files.slack.com``,
Discord needs no auth but signed ``cdn.discordapp.com`` URLs. The callback owns
that; this module owns everything after the bytes arrive.

    ``os.unlink`` is a blocking syscall and TMPDIR is not always local (a
    network- or FUSE-backed temp dir makes each unlink a round trip), so the
    deletes go to a worker thread like every other cleanup on this path.

    Submitting the work is what makes the deletion durable, not awaiting it:
    the callers are ``except BaseException`` handlers, so a second cancellation
    can interrupt this await — but the thread is already queued and the
    executor still runs it, including through ``shutdown_default_executor``.

    A ``CancelledError`` from the await is therefore NOT a reason to delete
    inline: ``to_thread`` submits to the executor before it awaits, so by the time
    cancellation can be observed the worker already owns the deletion. Cleaning up
    again here would both repeat the work and put the blocking syscalls back on the
    loop, on the very path (a cancel arriving during shutdown) where the stall
    would be worst.

    ``RuntimeError`` is the opposite case and the only one that falls back: the
    loop refused the work outright (already closed, executor shut down), so no
    worker owns it. Blocking a loop that is finished costs nothing, whereas
    skipping the delete would leave a user's DECRYPTED attachment readable on disk
    — the whole reason these handlers exist.

    Both return normally rather than re-raising: the caller is about to ``raise``
    the exception it was already handling, and surfacing this one instead would
    replace the real reason the turn ended.
