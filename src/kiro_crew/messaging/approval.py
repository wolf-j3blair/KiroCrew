"""Tool approval by TYPED REPLY, for channels that have no interactive widget.

This is the fallback ``transport.py`` and ``renderer.py`` both already promise:
a channel declaring ``max_buttons=0`` renders no widget and strips the
``[OPTIONS:]`` trailer, and both docstrings say the numbered-text form "lands
with the approval-ladder work". This module is that work, and it is
channel-neutral for the same reason the button cap is: a channel cannot forget
what it does not implement itself.

Without it, a zero-widget channel is not merely less pretty -- it cannot run a
tool at all. ``TurnDriver`` in ``interactive`` mode is deny-by-default with no
decider (``driver.py``), so every permission request is refused, and nothing in
the conversation says so. The operator sees an agent that answers questions and
silently fails to act.

**The security shape, which is the whole point of the module:**

* **Deny on silence.** The wait resolves to DENY on timeout. There is no path
  where not answering means yes. :data:`TEXT_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_S` is held well
  under ``acp/client.py``'s ``_TOOL_STALL_TIMEOUT`` because no provider frame
  arrives while a permission is pending, so a longer window here would let the
  harness's own stall watchdog fire first and tear down a turn the operator was
  still deciding on.
* **An answer is bound to ONE request.** The registry is keyed by
  ``session_key`` AND ``request_id``, and a delivered verdict removes its
  entry. A "yes" typed after a request timed out cannot approve the NEXT tool
  the agent asks for -- the reply finds no open entry and is reported as
  expired instead of silently becoming consent.
* **Authorization is NOT here.** Whether a given sender may answer at all is a
  channel question (the transport knows who its operator is), so the channel
  gates the decider's construction. This module never sees a user id, which
  keeps it from being the place someone accidentally makes approval
  world-readable.
* **Trust reuses the session's own approval policy** rather than adding a
  second trust store. ``slack/handler.py`` keeps an in-memory
  ``_trusted_sessions`` set that ``dashboard/server.py`` already reaches across
  a circular-import boundary to clear; a third copy of "is this session
  trusted" would be one more thing to keep in sync. ``SessionManager``'s
  approval policy is durable, already SEL-audited on write, and already what
  spawned subagents inherit.

Dependency direction: stdlib only. No channel import, and nothing from
``slack``.
