"""Full new-path dispatch: DiscordTransport -> TurnDriver -> DiscordRenderer.

``DiscordTransport.receive()`` authorizes + normalizes an inbound message and
hands the ``InboundMessage`` to :meth:`DiscordDispatcher.handle_message`,
which mirrors the Telegram transport dispatch:

    command intercept (!new, !compact, !help, …)
    -> construct DiscordRenderer + on_turn_start (typing indicator)
    -> session acquire -> context build
    -> TurnDriver.run(provider, renderer)   # shared redaction + approval ladder
    -> post-turn (record_success, persist, soft-threshold notice)  # each guarded
    -> renderer.close() + session release   # in finally

``on_interaction`` resolves interactive tool approvals (``a:<rid>:<1|0>`` ->
``DiscordApprovalDecider.resolve_global``) and re-injects ``[OPTIONS:]``
choices (``opt:<i>``) as fresh turns.

Dependency direction is ``discord -> messaging`` (allowed). The security
``tool_gate`` and spawn auto-approve are wired inline off ``ctx_builder.hooks``
(channel-neutral) so this module never imports ``kiro_crew.slack``.

        ``interpret_commands`` says whether *text* may execute as a command
        (model-authored text never may). Resume routing is consulted when
        ``interpret_commands`` is true OR the turn carries an ``origin_tag`` —
        the tag implies routing, because validating it requires resolving the
        binding to compare keys. The callers that dispatch with commands off
        and no tag DEPEND on the skip: a queue drain replays messages that were
        accepted for the native session while it was busy (a resumed session's
        busy turn hands the message to the dashboard slot's own queue or steer
        path and never to this queue, so a drained item's affinity is native by
        construction), and an AutoNudge fire targets the native key
        its loop resolved and rotation-checked — routing either into a binding
        created later would run them in a session that never queued or armed
        them. An ``[OPTIONS:]`` press dispatches with commands off but a
        non-empty tag: the buttons were rendered on the bound session's own
        reply, so the choice belongs to that session even though its label must
        not execute as a command.

        ``origin_tag`` is the provenance stamp a pressed option button carried
        (see :func:`~kiro_crew.discord.renderer.session_provenance_tag`). When
        non-empty, the turn runs ONLY if the session it resolves to is the one
        that posted the buttons — checked before the busy path (so a stale press
        cannot be queued and replayed tag-less) and AGAIN after idle/daily
        rotation (so it cannot run under a generation the tag never named).
        Discord replays old components indefinitely, so without this check a
        button minted by one session would inject its model-authored choice into
        whatever session the conversation was later rebound to (`!unlink` +
        `!sessions`), or into a post-`!new` conversation that never asked the
        question. An option press ALWAYS supplies a tag: untagged
        (pre-provenance) presses are refused at the interaction boundary in
        :meth:`on_interaction`, never dispatched here.

        Registered into the channel-neutral
        :mod:`~kiro_crew.messaging.spawn_approval_delivery` seam so the single
        host spawn gate can reach the same Approve/Deny buttons the main-agent
        tool ladder already uses here. Returns the user's decision
        (``True``/``False``), or ``None`` to tell the gate "not surfaced here,
        fall through to Slack/dashboard": for a key this dispatcher cannot turn
        back into a conversation (a ``unified`` dm_scope drops the peer, a
        non-``discord`` key, an unparseable one), when the client is not up, when
        the channels governance profile denies this channel, when the
        destination's authorization has since been withdrawn, or when the post
        fails.

        The wait is the SAME deny-by-default one a tool prompt uses
        (:class:`DiscordApprovalDecider`, ``APPROVAL_TIMEOUT_S``): the press
        resolves through the ``on_interaction`` ``a:`` branch exactly as a tool
        approval does, so a spawn id (``spawn:<agent_id>``) cannot collide with an
        opaque tool id in a registry keyed by ``session_key:request_id``.

        The prompt is armed under ``parent_session_key`` VERBATIM (its ``:genN``
        suffix included), while a press recomputes the key from the LIVE
        conversation (``_inbound_session_key``). Anything that moves that key
        between the spawn and the press — a generation rotation from ``!new``, an
        idle or daily reset, or a resumed session taking the channel over — means
        the recomputed key does not match the armed one, the press resolves
        nothing, and the prompt deny-by-defaults at its timeout (the user sees
        "already expired"). This mirrors how a mid-run tool prompt behaves across a
        rotation, and it stays a DENY: the prompt WAS surfaced, so ``False`` is a
        real decision and the gate refuses the spawn on it rather than re-offering
        it on Slack/dashboard. An elapsed wait falls through in one case only, when
        AUTHORIZATION ended during it and no press could have answered: the
        destination rosters are re-read here (``_spawn_prompt_destination_permitted``,
        the pair that gated the post), and the channels ceiling is read by the seam
        (``unpressed_wait_answer``), which owns that reading for every channel.

        deny-by-defaults at the timeout, and the gate reads that elapsed wait as a
        decision nobody made. Answering False makes the delivery fall through

        skips only a body-equal row carrying the same mid. A fresh id there would
        never match the slot save's copy and the turn would land on disk twice.

        With no live slot nothing has the row yet, so it is a plain append under a
        newly minted id.

        *extra_row* is the turn's OUTCOME row when it produced no assistant text:
        ``(role, text, cls, mid)`` -- the driver's empty-turn ``notice`` on a
        completed turn, or the ``error`` a raised turn died with -- written after
        the user's row so the transcript never ends on an unanswered message. Its
        ``mid`` is the id ``project_channel_row_live`` minted for the live window
        (the same idempotency rule as *mirror_mids*), or ``None`` for a plain
        append.

        *reply_text* arrives already normalized by the caller (whitespace alone
        is ``""``), and is tested for truth here exactly as
        ``project_channel_turn_live`` tests it, so the live window and the disk
        can never disagree about whether an assistant row exists.
