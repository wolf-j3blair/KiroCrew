"""How each harness receives Crew's MCP servers, projected from its declaration.

The other half of the ability card. :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backend_cards`
projects what a harness can DO from the capability memberships; this projects what
happens to the AGENT SPEC on the way to it, from the declarations
``providers/mirrors`` already carries:

* :class:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.registry.McpProjection` -- the KIND
  (native / mirror / external / no-channel / broker-only), and for a mirror the
  reach of a per-TOOL MCP restriction (:class:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.registry.PerToolDeny`);
* each mirror's :meth:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.base.AgentConfigMirror.rulings`
  -- one :class:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.base.Disposition` per
  :class:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.base.Concern` the spec carries.

Both were written to be read by a maintainer reviewing a projection, and neither
reached a reader choosing a harness. That is the whole gap: a user on codex gets a
permission mode pinned regardless of what their agent file asked for, an
``autoApprove`` block that is not honoured, a model list taken from the adapter
rather than Crew's registry, and hooks that reach no channel -- four deliberate,
defensible rulings, none of them visible before a session runs.

**This declares. It does not enforce.** Per-tool MCP deny is not a requirement on
every provider: a harness with no per-call deny channel withholds the whole server
instead, and what it owes a reader is to SAY so before they pick it. Nothing here
changes what any backend delivers.

Derived, not authored
---------------------
Same rule as the capability card, and for the same reason: a harness onboarded
without a card is a card that says "nothing declared", never a card that is
silently wrong. There is no ``if backend ==`` in this file, no harness id is
named, and a new harness renders a complete section the moment its
``PROJECTIONS`` entry exists -- which the mirror parity test already requires
before it can be selectable.

What is deliberately NOT on it
------------------------------
* **The prose.** ``McpProjection.reason`` and ``Ruling.reason`` are written for the
  reader of the registry, at registry length, in a maintainer's register -- one of
  them names an upstream Rust function. The card renders the DISPOSITION, which is
  the part an operator can act on. A user-facing reason is a NEW field every mirror
  fills in, not this one re-registered.
* **Transports.** Which transports a harness accepts is not a per-backend constant
  and must not be rendered as one: it is read from THIS session's ``initialize``
  answer (``providers.mirrors.codex.drop_unadvertised_transports`` over
  ``agentCapabilities.mcpCapabilities``), precisely so a released adapter that
  gains or drops one is not silently contradicted by a table. A pre-session card
  holds no handshake, so it states the kind and leaves the transport to the
  session that negotiated it.
* **A verdict.** Every disposition here is a declared ruling with a reason behind
  it. The card is advisory: it does not refuse a selection, and no field of it
  gates anything. ``providers/mirrors/README.md`` ("Fill the card") is where that
  rule, and the two surfaces it holds for, are written down once.

The only reader of the declaration inside the boundary
-----------------------------------------------------
``projection_for`` is imported here and nowhere else under ``agent_sdk``, and every
question about the declaration is answered here -- the kind, the per-tool deny reach,
the per-concern dispositions, and the ``no-channel`` gap's own address. That is an
invariant rather than a coincidence, and it is what ``cli_doctor`` depends on: two
projections over one record are two readings that can disagree, and a report that
states the same declared consequence in two voices is a report whose prose drifts
from the record it describes. One reader, one phrasing per fact.

Why a module of its own
-----------------------
``backend_cards`` is a pure projection over ``agent_sdk.backends``, a leaf
``config.loader`` reaches during ``KiroCrewConfig.load()``. The declarations read
here live in ``kiro_crew.providers``, so the import is function-local (``agent_sdk``
is the one tree the agent-sdk-boundary gate exempts, but an import edge added at
module scope would put a providers import on that load path). Keeping it beside
the card rather than inside it is what lets each stay a projection over one source.
