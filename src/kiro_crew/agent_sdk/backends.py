"""Which ACP backends this build can serve — the one place that decides.

The question this module owns is **capability**: can this build drive the harness
at all? The public baseline registers kiro-cli, Claude Code, KAS and Codex; an
edition plugin adds its own from ``ProviderRegistry.register_acp_backends`` by calling
:func:`register_selectable_backend`, the structural twin of
``publish_provider.register_provider``.

A LEAF module on purpose. ``kiro_crew/acp/__init__.py`` imports the ACP client and
runtime, so reaching ``kiro_crew.acp.types`` executes that package init and lands
back in ``config.loader`` — a cycle ``_normalize_acp_backend`` can only escape by
deferring the import. Under that cycle the selectable list can live in one place
only if that place imports nothing: the loader's ``acp_backend`` field metadata,
the dashboard's PATCH allowlist and ``acp.types`` cannot import each other, so each
would otherwise carry its own literal with a drift test standing in for a code
owner. Nothing here imports ``kiro_crew.acp``,
``kiro_crew.config`` or ``kiro_crew.platform``, so all three now derive from this
module — and a plugin-registered backend reaches the dashboard without a core
edit, which a literal could never do.

Whether a registered backend may be selected on a *given deployment* is a separate
question (an enterprise policy bounding the fleet to one harness). It is
deliberately NOT answered here: it needs a governance ceiling, resolving a ceiling
reaches ``current_context()``, and that call's lazy branch loads config — so asking
it from :func:`resolve_selected_backend`, which runs inside
``KiroCrewConfig.load()``, re-enters that load and recurses. Keeping this module
capability-only is what makes the load path safe.

Where this module lives, and why it moved
-----------------------------------------
This file WAS ``kiro_crew/acp_backends.py``. RFC PR 3 offered two ways to stop
application code from asking a backend's IDENTITY: move the tables in here, or
leave them where they were and put a query layer in front. Option 1 — the move —
is what landed, because a table left outside the boundary keeps its old import
path reachable, and a reachable old path is the one a new consumer finds. The
top-level module survives as a pure re-export shim so no existing call site had
to change in the same commit as the move.

``kiro_crew.acp_backends`` still imports, still exports the same names, and still
mutates the SAME registry state: the shim re-exports the functions defined here
rather than copying them, so ``register_selectable_backend`` and
``apply_selectable_denials`` reach one ``_baseline``/``_selectable`` pair however
they were imported.

The leaf property is preserved and it is load-bearing. Nothing on the import
chain this module now sits behind (``agent_sdk/__init__`` ->
``backend_install`` + ``native_commands`` -> ``agent_sdk.drivers.acp``) imports
``kiro_crew.config``, ``kiro_crew.platform`` or ``kiro_crew.acp`` at module
scope — the driver defers every ACP import into a function body — so
``config.loader`` can still reach the registry from inside
``KiroCrewConfig.load()`` without re-entering it.

Capability-set dispositions
---------------------------
Every ``ACP_BACKENDS_*`` name below is one of three things, and saying which is
what keeps the next reader from exposing a driver-internal membership as a
consumer-facing question. ``test_agent_sdk_capabilities`` fails if a set exists
with no row here.

* **semantic question** — a consumer outside the boundary asks it, so
  :class:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.capabilities.SessionCapabilities` carries a field
  for it and the consumer reads that field, never the set.
* **pre-session registry query** — asked ABOUT a backend id before any session
  exists (config load, the dashboard's option list, an install probe), so a
  session-scoped capability object is the wrong shape for it.
* **driver-internal** — read only inside ``kiro_crew.acp`` while it drives the
  harness. It has no consumer above the boundary and must not grow one.

       read-only tools under the derived ``<agent>--readonly`` spec; asked
       about the configured backend id before the side session is created)
   * - ``ACP_BACKENDS_SERIAL_SESSION_STARTS``
     - driver-internal (whether a timed-out session start names the unanswered
       starts and mode switches it was sent behind on the same process)
   * - ``ACP_BACKENDS_HARNESS_OWNED_SESSIONS``
     - driver-internal (whether ``session/load`` is gated on a Crew-side transcript)
   * - ``ACP_BACKENDS_LOAD_WITHOUT_MODES``
     - driver-internal (whether a successful session-restore result carries no
       ``modes`` block)
   * - ``ACP_BACKENDS_RESUME_WITHOUT_LOAD``
     - driver-internal (which ACP verb restores a session, and which capability
       key advertises it)
   * - ``ACP_BACKENDS_USER_LEVEL_AGENT_SPECS_ONLY``
     - driver-internal (whether the session's project checkout scopes the broker
       overlay lookup, read only through :func:`overlay_project_scope` while
       ``kiro_crew.acp`` composes the ``session/new`` MCP array). Deliberately not
       a semantic question: it describes where a HOST reads agent specs from, and
       no consumer above the boundary asks it -- what a consumer would ask about
       is the resulting server list, which it already receives

The two non-set tables ``SessionCapabilities`` also translates are
:func:`model_registry_namespace` (the model-id namespace) and
:func:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backend_identity.is_claude_backend_name` (the provider
seam). Both already existed; neither gained a member here.

ACP_BACKEND_OPENCODE = "opencode"
# Pi: the ``pi`` coding agent reached through a third-party npm adapter, ``pi-acp``.
# TWO components, and the split is load-bearing for the install probe: the adapter
# is the ACP server and the agent is what it spawns (``pi --mode rpc``), and either
# can be absent on its own. There is no ``pi acp`` subcommand. Pi runs no
# permission gate of its own, so Crew loads one INTO it -- see
# :data:`Routing.VERIFIED_GATE_EXTENSION`.
ACP_BACKEND_PI = "pi"
# goose: a single binary that serves ACP itself (``goose acp``). No npm adapter and
# no Node floor, so its install probe names ONE component -- the shape opencode has
# and the opposite of pi's two. What distinguishes it is where its permission route
# comes from: goose resolves ``GOOSE_MODE`` out of its own ENVIRONMENT and above its
# config file, so the mode is settled in the ``session/new`` result rather than
# applied to a session that already exists -- see
# :data:`Routing.VERIFIED_SEEDED_SETTINGS`.
#
# VERIFIED RANGE: goose 1.50.x (1.50.1 is the recorded binary). Three things Crew holds
# this harness to are wire FACTS of that release rather than spec guarantees, and they do
# not all fail the same way, so each is named with its direction:
#
# * ``modes.currentModeId`` on every ``session/new`` and ``session/load`` -- fails CLOSED:
#   a session with no readable mode is refused.
# * the tool identity in ``_meta.goose.toolCall`` on every ``tool_call`` frame -- fails
#   CLOSED: an unclassifiable approval is refused, on every session and on both sites
#   that answer a permission request, whether or not the session carries a deny set.
# * a ``current_mode_update`` on the session's own connection whenever the mode MOVES --
#   fails OPEN: the mid-session tripwire fires on that frame, so a release that stops
#   emitting it leaves a session that left the required mode running unrefused until
#   the next restore. This is the one fact of the three whose loss is not self-announcing.
#
# So a release that moves either of the first two turns into refused sessions or refused
# approvals; a release that drops the third silently narrows the tripwire back to the
# open/restore read-back. The corpus pins all three
# (``test/fixtures/acp_frames/goose/``; the mode-move emission is pinned by the tripwire
# test reading a live ``current_mode_update`` naming ``auto`` off
# ``session-load-live.jsonl``). Re-verify all three against a fresh capture before raising
# this range, and re-capture the mode move deliberately -- it is the one a routine
# re-record would not exercise. A session on a release outside the range is named at the
# handshake (``AcpClient._note_goose_version`` reads ``agentInfo.version`` off
# ``initialize``), so the one silent loss has a signal before the first prompt.

# ── Capability: where a harness gets its MCP servers ──

#: Harnesses that receive their MCP servers as a PER-SESSION array on
#: ``session/new`` / ``session/load`` instead of reading an agent file.
#:
#: kiro-cli (and KAS, which is kiro-cli's relay) is handed ``--agent`` and loads
#: the spec itself, so Crew passes it an empty array — a duplicate there would
#: shadow the spec's own entries. claude-agent-acp reads no agent file at all, so
#: the array is the only channel CREW has onto the session's MCP surface (the harness
#: mounts what its own user- and project-scope ``mcpServers`` and plugins declare
#: beside it): an empty one means the harness works while every Crew tool is
#: silently absent.
#:
#: codex-acp is the second member, and it joins on the same terms rather than on
#: an exact likeness to claude: it does load a config file of its OWN
#: (``~/.codex/config.toml``, which Crew never writes — create-or-decline), and its
#: ``build_session_config`` merges the client's array on top of what that file
#: declared. What makes it a member is the part that matters here: it reads no
#: ``~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json``, so this array is the only channel CREW has, and
#: an empty one means Crew's own control plane never reaches the session.
#:
#: A membership set rather than ``_is_claude`` because this is a property of the
#: transport, not of Anthropic: any ACP adapter that does not read Crew's agent
#: spec belongs here, and the next such harness should join the set rather than
#: add a second branch at the call site (harness-parity H6).
#
# opencode is the third member, and it is here because the reason it was EXCLUDED
# was wrong rather than because anything about the harness changed. That reason read
# its ``initialize`` result -- ``mcpCapabilities: {"http": true, "sse": true}`` --
# as an advertisement carrying "no stdio", and concluded the array could not mount
# the stdio servers Crew puts in it. ACP's ``McpCapabilities`` schema has exactly
# two boolean fields, ``http`` and ``sse``, and NO stdio field, so a conforming
# agent cannot advertise stdio at all and that answer is what full support looks
# like. Absence of a flag that cannot exist is not evidence. Driven against
# opencode 1.18.30, the element ``acp.session_mcp.acp_server_element`` already
# emits is accepted, the named child is spawned, its tools are listed and the
# element's ``env`` reaches it -- so the excluded harness had in fact been serving
# sessions with none of Crew's own tools for no reason at all. The exclusion also
# contradicted the shipped code it sat beside: the shared gateway's broker stubs
# are stdio elements too (``mcp_gateway.session_servers._acp_server_entry``) and
# ``_pooled_mcp_servers`` appended them to this very array for opencode whenever
# pooling was on. See ``providers/mirrors/opencode.py``.
# Pi is NOT a member, for a reason that is worse than absence and is exactly why
# membership is evidence-based: ``pi-acp`` ACCEPTS the array on ``session/new``
# without error, stores it on its session state, and never hands it to the ``pi``
# process -- driven against pi-acp 0.0.33, a stdio server placed in the array
# produced no error and no tool, and the adapter's own documentation lists MCP
# under its limitations. A server in the array is therefore accepted and inert.
# Membership here would make the dashboard report Crew tools as mounted on a
# session where none can be called, which is the one state an absent tool never
# produces. See ``providers/mirrors/registry.py`` for the projection that says so.
# goose is the fourth member and it joins on a ROUND TRIP rather than on an accepted
# element, which is the distinction pi's exclusion exists to draw. Driven against
# goose 1.50.1: one element shaped as ``acp.session_mcp.acp_server_element`` emits is
# placed on ``session/new``, and goose asks the named stdio child ``initialize``,
# ``notifications/initialized``, ``tools/list`` and ``tools/call``, with the tool's
# own result arriving back on ``tool_call_update``. Its ``initialize`` advertises
# ``mcpCapabilities: {"http": true, "sse": false}`` and no stdio flag, which is the
# same absence-of-an-impossible-field non-evidence recorded for opencode above.
# goose surfaces such a tool as ``<serverName>__<toolName>`` -- a double underscore
# and no ``mcp__`` prefix -- and carries ``toolName`` and ``extensionName``
# separately in ``_meta.goose.toolCall``.
#
# One hazard rides along, and it is the INVERSE of a session that fails whole: an
# element whose command cannot start does not fail ``session/new`` on goose. The
# session is created normally with that element dropped, so an unstartable pooled
# broker stub costs no session here but leaves a healthy-looking one carrying none of
# Crew's tools.
# Harnesses opted into the fail-closed approval posture: a ``tool_call`` frame carrying
# NEITHER an ACP ``kind`` nor the harness's own ``_meta`` identity channel classifies as
# nothing, and on an auto-approve path with a deny set configured its approval is refused
# rather than answered blind.
#
# Membership is the SCOPE of that refusal, and the scope is the point. What proves a
# harness classifies EVERY tool class is a recording of every tool class -- and a corpus
# of a few frames shows a channel exists, never that no class omits it. So membership is
# held to a measurement, per backend: the coverage pin in ``test_acp_goose_backend.py``
# asserts every committed ``tool_call`` frame in the member's corpus is classifiable, and
# the member's corpus has to have been recorded broadly enough for that to mean anything.
#
# goose is in because its corpus is the case that NEEDS the refusal -- its builtin shell
# frames carry no ``kind`` at all, captured live -- and every recorded frame carries its
# channel. kiro-cli is deliberately absent, for the same reason ``kas`` is: both publish
# ``_meta.kiro``, but the recorded kiro corpus holds two tool_call frames of two classes,
# which is not a measurement of every class, and no kiro defect (an approval answered
# blind) has been observed that the refusal would close. Neither loses anything by being
# out: a harness outside the set keeps its behaviour exactly. Adding one is one entry here
# plus one on its channel row, and the pin then checks it against its own recordings --
# which for kiro means first recording a frame per builtin tool class.
#
# The channel TABLE lives in ``kiro_crew.acp._dispatch`` (it holds wire field names, which
# are driver detail); this set is the vocabulary half, and a test asserts the two agree so
# a row and its membership cannot drift apart.

#
# deepseek IS a member, on a captured ROUND TRIP rather than on the advertisement or
# on a mount that was merely attempted:
# ``test/fixtures/acp_frames/deepseek/mcp-stdio-mount-live.jsonl``. Its ``initialize``
# result carries ``mcpCapabilities: {"http": true}``, which names only the transports
# ACP v1 treats as OPTIONAL -- stdio is the baseline every v1 agent may serve, so an
# absent stdio flag is not a refusal. In that capture ``session/new`` is sent one
# element shaped as ``mcp_gateway.session_servers._acp_server_entry`` emits a pooled
# broker stub, pointing at a real stdio MCP server; it returns a sessionId, the server
# is asked ``initialize``, ``tools/list`` AND ``tools/call``, and the turn carries a
# ``tool_call`` titled ``mcp__<serverName>__<toolName>`` with the server's own result.
# The premise is load-bearing, which is why it is captured and not declared: if stdio
# were refused, ``session/new`` would fail WHOLE rather than degrade, and the harness
# would be broken rather than tool-less -- see
# ``mcp-stdio-rollback-live.jsonl`` for what an unstartable element actually does.
# It reads no ``~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json``, so this array is the only channel Crew
# has to it.

# ── The selectable registry ──

#: What the public edition ships.
#:
#: ``ACP_BACKEND_CLAUDE`` is included because the public build can genuinely serve a
#: session with it: ``acp/client.py`` owns the whole spawn path (the ``_is_claude``
#: branch, ``_resolve_claude_acp_bin``, ``_resolve_claude_code_executable``) and the
#: adapter it needs is a PUBLIC npm package (``CLAUDE_ACP_NPM_PKG``). Nothing about it
#: is edition-private. An earlier revision left it out and described it as a "dormant
#: seam ... not something a public build can serve a session with", which made the
#: option render as permanently unavailable on exactly the builds that could run it —
#: the switch was the only missing piece, not the harness.
#:
#: Whether it is USABLE on a given machine is a separate question with its own answer:
#: :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backend_install` probes for the two binaries and the
#: dashboard reports what is absent plus the command that installs it.
#:
#: ``ACP_BACKEND_CODEX`` is included, and the two things that were missing when it
#: was not are both worth naming, because each was a separate reason:
#:
#: * ``backend_install`` now has a probe, so the install row reads ``missing`` with
#:   the component and the command rather than ``unknown``. A switch that cannot say
#:   what is absent when a session fails is a switch offered ahead of the code that
#:   answers for it.
#: * its tool calls are ROUTED. ``acp_tool_gate`` verifies ``session/new``
#:   advertised ``mode=read-only`` and applies it before the first prompt, refusing
#:   the session otherwise, so the PreToolUse gate is armed for the calls it makes.
#:
#: One gap REMAINS and is survivable rather than closed: ACP v1 offers no way to
#: make an adapter ask for a passive READ, so the sensitive-path block cannot see
#: reads this harness performs. What made that dangerous was the credential homes
#: the standard sandbox tier leaves open, and those are denied to its child at the
#: OS boundary by ``acp_tool_gate.adapter_hidden_credential_dirs`` -- derived from
#: the read-gate floor itself, so the compensating control covers exactly what the
#: control it compensates for covers, minus the harness's own token store.
#: ``ACP_BACKEND_OPENCODE`` is included on the same two conditions Codex had to
#: meet, and it meets them by a different mechanism:
#:
#: * ``backend_install`` probes for the ``opencode`` binary, so the install row
#:   names the component and the command that installs it rather than reading
#:   ``unknown``.
#: * its tool calls are ROUTED, and the routing is VERIFIED rather than declared.
#:   OpenCode asks per tool call only while its own ``permission`` setting is
#:   ``ask``; its default is permissive. So the client supplies ``permission: "ask"``
#:   as inline config in the child's environment -- which this harness resolves
#:   above its own project config file, so nothing is written into a checked-out
#:   repository -- then READS THE HARNESS'S OWN RESOLVED CONFIGURATION BACK and
#:   refuses the session when the required value is not in force. See
#:   :data:`Routing.VERIFIED_SEEDED_SETTINGS`.
#:
#: ``ACP_BACKEND_PI`` is included on the same two conditions, met by a third
#: mechanism, because this harness has NO permission setting to seed: ``pi`` runs
#: every tool call without asking, by design, and ``pi-acp`` sends
#: ``session/request_permission`` only when an EXTENSION inside ``pi`` raises a
#: confirm dialog. So:
#:
#: * ``backend_install`` probes for BOTH components -- the adapter and the agent --
#:   and names whichever is absent, since either can be missing on its own.
#: * its tool calls are ROUTED because Crew loads its own gate extension into the
#:   ``pi`` process at spawn, which raises that dialog for every tool call, and the
#:   precondition is VERIFIED before the first prompt by asking the harness's own
#:   command registry whether the extension loaded from the shipped file. See
#:   :data:`Routing.VERIFIED_GATE_EXTENSION`.
#:
#: ``ACP_BACKEND_GOOSE`` is included on the same two conditions, met by the FIRST
#: mechanism, and it is the only member whose routing needs nothing applied after
#: the session exists:
#:
#: * ``backend_install`` probes for the ``goose`` binary, one component, because the
#:   harness's own release ships the executable that serves ACP.
#: * its tool calls are ROUTED and the routing is VERIFIED. goose asks per tool call
#:   only in its ``approve`` mode and its own default is ``auto``, which
#:   auto-approves; the client supplies ``GOOSE_MODE=approve`` in the child's
#:   environment, which goose resolves ABOVE its own config file, and then reads the
#:   mode goose reports back in ``modes.currentModeId`` on the very response that
#:   creates or restores the session. The read-back is on the SAME connection as the
#:   session -- no second child, and no window in which the session is live and the
#:   mode is unconfirmed. See :data:`Routing.VERIFIED_SEEDED_SETTINGS`.
#: * ``backend_install`` probes for the ``dsh`` binary, one component, because the
#:   harness's own release ships the executable that serves ACP from its ``acp``
#:   profile.
#: * its tool calls are ROUTED and the routing is VERIFIED. Its sandbox decides an
#:   action itself and its own ``session/request_permission`` carries only a
#:   model-initiated escalation -- so
#:   the gate is not a setting Crew can seed but a PLUGIN Crew composes, through the
#:   per-launch patch its own launcher documents. The plugin answers the harness's
#:   ``tools/pre-execute`` waterfall with ``ask``, which its tools core resolves
#:   through ``ctx.approval`` and its ACP bridge answers by emitting
#:   ``session/request_permission`` per call. The read-back is the gate's own load
#:   marker, keyed to this session's nonce and to Crew's sealed file, read before the
#:   first prompt. See :data:`Routing.VERIFIED_GATE_EXTENSION` and
#:   :data:`Readback.LOAD_MARKER`.

    leaves the harness runnable but unreachable, which is exactly the state a
    hard-coded list produced: an option absent from the dashboard on a build that
    could run it.

    Writes the BASELINE and the effective set together, so an edition that
    registers after a policy pass has already run is still visible to the next
    recompute rather than being silently dropped by it.

    Idempotent, so a re-entrant bootstrap costs nothing. Rejects an id outside
    ``ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN``: provider construction would raise on it later, and a
    dashboard option that cannot start a session is worse than an absent one.

    ALSO rejects a harness whose routing is :attr:`Routing.UNVERIFIED`, and that
    second refusal is the one worth reading. ``ACP_BACKENDS_KNOWN`` membership is
    not a safety property: it says a build can SPELL the id, which is what lets a
    governance rule deny it. Selectability is a different claim, because a
    selectable harness starts sessions — and for an ``UNVERIFIED`` one nothing
    establishes that its tool calls reach ``HookManager.on_tool_call``, its
    routing verdict is INDETERMINATE so nothing refuses the session, and
    ``tool_gate.is_enforced`` is False so the spawn path applies no compensating
    credential mask. One call from an out-of-repo edition would put a harness in
    exactly that state on the switch, and the only thing standing in its way
    otherwise is a frozen literal plus a test that names it.

    There is deliberately NO opt-out. A keyword flag here would be a documented way
    to put an ungated harness on the switch, and no shipped caller wants one: every
    known backend but one is routed, and the one that is not is deliberately absent
    from the selectable baseline. A harness must have established routing BEFORE it

# Every capability a backend may claim is an OPT-IN set here, never a negation at
# the call site. ``not is_claude_backend`` reads correctly with two backends and
# then silently hands the capability to the third, so a harness that has never
# demonstrated the capability inherits it — and the operator who never opted into
# that harness is the one who finds out. Adding a member is a deliberate edit
# with evidence; inheriting a default is not a decision. See
# docs/system-specs/modules/harness-parity.md.

# Backends whose single process can host N concurrent ACP sessions (AcpRuntime
# demux) AND whose shared subagent session can be CONTINUED after the conversation
# that spawned it ends. claude-agent-acp runs through AcpClient (one process per
# session) and is not a member.
#
# What survives is the PERSISTED THREAD, never a resident session. Teardown closes:
# a subagent session left alive on the shared process after its parent ends is a
# memory leak, and on codex an expensive one -- each resident session carries the MCP
# fleet ``codex`` starts from its own config, measured at roughly 44 processes and
# 2751 MB for one session. So a member's teardown disposes the in-memory session, and
# ``spawn_continue`` re-reaches the conversation by loading the record the host kept.
# Membership therefore asks one question: after this backend's teardown verb, can a
# ``session/load`` still restore the thread?
#
# kiro-cli answers yes with a transcript Crew holds under ``<kiro home>/sessions/cli``
# that ``_kiro.dev/session/terminate`` leaves on disk.
#
# codex-acp answers yes with a thread ``codex`` persists under ``CODEX_HOME``, and
# the answer is MEASURED rather than argued -- codex-acp 1.11.0 against codex
# 0.154.0, one real adapter:
#
#   * ``session/close`` (a request) evicts: the sessionId stops answering. That is
#     the same fact ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_EVICTION`` records, and it is unchanged.
#   * ``session/load`` on that closed id SUCCEEDS, replays the conversation, and the
#     session then answers a question about the first turn.
#   * the same load succeeds from a RESTARTED adapter process over the same
#     ``CODEX_HOME`` -- the shape a continuation actually takes, since the runtime
#     that served the subagent is usually gone by then. Token accounting confirms
#     the context came from the thread rather than the prompt: the recall turn spent
#     330 input tokens against 9786 cached-read.
#   * ``session/delete`` archives the thread and a load then refuses, so release has
#     a verb that genuinely disposes.
#
# ``ACP_BACKENDS_HARNESS_OWNED_SESSIONS`` is what carries that restore: codex
# resolves a load from the sessionId alone, with no Crew-side transcript to check.
# What is measured where, because the halves have different reach.
# ``test_real_codex_acp_session_close_evicts`` carries the ``real_adapter`` marker, so
# the contract lane runs it on a pinned adapter and an adapter bump that stops
# ``session/close`` evicting goes red there. The RESTORE half has no such lane cover:
# ``session/load`` on a thread the lane's fabricated credential created is refused --
# "no rollout found for thread id", measured -- because a session that never ran a real
# turn has nothing to reload, so the property cannot be asserted without a credential.
# ``test_real_codex_acp_load_after_close_restores`` is where it IS asserted, and that
# test is opt-in: it prompts, so it runs only where a host sets
# ``KIROCREW_LIVE_CODEX_PROMPT_TESTS`` and holds a codex credential, never in CI.
# So an adapter bump does not re-measure the restore this membership rests on, and a
# release that made ``close`` destroy the record would reach the field before any lane
# went red. Re-measuring it is a credentialled run of that opt-in test, which
# ``test/real_adapter_gate.py`` names as part of a codex-acp bump.
#
# KAS answers NO, and that is the whole of its exclusion: its teardown maps to
# ``_kiro/session/delete``, which REMOVES the persisted record, so there is nothing
# for a load to restore and a shared subagent would strand ``spawn_continue`` on
# ``conversation_gone``. A different gap from anything codex had, owned by whoever
# gives KAS a non-destroying teardown; until then its subagents get dedicated
# sessions, which is working behaviour rather than a degraded one.
#
# opencode is not a member: one binary serves one session over its own stdio pipe,
# so there is no second session to share.
# pi is not a member: Crew spawns one ``pi-acp`` process per session over its own
# stdio pipe, so there is no second session to share.
#
# deepseek is not a member, and here the limit is CREW's driver rather than the
# harness. The harness multiplexes: one connection carries several independent
# sessions, ``session/close`` disposes only the addressed one, and a closed session
# stays listable and resumable. What it is not served by is ``AcpRuntime``, the only
# demux Crew has -- see ``ACP_BACKENDS_ACP_RUNTIME`` -- so Crew opens one process per
# session and there is no shared session to persist. A harness capability Crew cannot

# definition over the wire (``_meta.kiro.customAgents``). kiro-cli v2 reads
# the template from disk at spawn and exposes no wire channel, so a member
# session on it stays a plain chat: the dispatch tools are simply not
# mounted, never mounted-and-refused.
#
# codex-acp is a member, and both things membership requires hold:
#
#   * the per-session mount exists -- ``providers/mirrors/codex.py`` projects the
#     whole array onto ``session/new`` (codex is in
#     ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_MCP_ARRAY``), so the dispatch element rides the same
#     channel the session's own servers do;
#   * the session is GATED -- codex's routing is ``SESSION_CONFIG``, one of the
#     three mechanisms in ``tool_gate.ENFORCED_ROUTINGS``, so a session that cannot
#     arm ``mode=read-only`` is REFUSED before its first prompt. That is
#     structurally stronger than claude's ``settings.local.json`` ownership check,
#     which covers a routing this core declares and does not enforce.
#
# Membership is a DECISION on top of those two rather than a consequence of them:
# mounting session control into a codex DM thread is a capability separate from
# giving a codex session the tools its own agent spec declares. The decision is
# that a member DM thread on codex holds the session-control tools.
#
# Membership un-withholds nothing, because the entry is Crew's OWN.
# ``mirrors.identity.identity_bound_crew_servers`` keeps the dashboard server out of
# the projection, and that withhold judges SPEC-DESCRIBED elements: one the agent
# file names carries no session identity and answers ``identity_unattested`` to
# every call. The dispatch entry comes from
# ``members.member_dispatch_session_server`` carrying this session's key and its
# signed stub token, the same way the projection rebuilds the control plane.
#
# opencode is a member, and it holds the same two things:
#
#   * the per-session mount exists -- opencode is in
#     ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_MCP_ARRAY`` and ``providers/mirrors/opencode.py``
#     projects the array onto ``session/new``, so the dispatch element rides the
#     channel the session's own servers ride. The harness reads no agent file of
#     Crew's, so that array is the ONLY channel any tool set reaches it on;
#   * the session is GATED -- its routing is ``VERIFIED_SEEDED_SETTINGS``, one of
#     the three mechanisms in ``tool_gate.ENFORCED_ROUTINGS``. The value is seeded
#     on ``OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`` and READ BACK from the harness's own config
#     resolution before the first prompt, so a session that cannot establish the
#     asking posture is REFUSED rather than run. The read-back is what makes this
#     routing VERIFIED rather than merely seeded, and it is the whole of the
#     difference from claude's.
#
# H6 is explicit that supporting one harness establishes nothing about another, so
# the decision above is codex's alone and this membership carries its own: a member
# DM thread on opencode holds the session-control tools.
#
# The mount asks for no owned permission file here, and must not: the client's
# fallback answers for an UNENFORCED routing alone (``tool_gate.is_enforced`` is true
# for this one), and ``providers/mirrors/opencode.py`` documents
# ``permission_surface_owned`` as accepted-and-ignored for that same reason -- the
# flag stands in for a read-back this harness performs, and no opencode session owns
# a ``settings.local.json`` to satisfy it with.
#
# Membership un-withholds nothing, for the reason it un-withholds nothing on codex:
# ``mirrors.identity.identity_bound_crew_servers`` keeps the dashboard server out of
# the SPEC projection, because an element the agent file names carries no session
# identity, while the entry mounted here is Crew's own and carries this session's key
# and its signed stub token.
#
# One restriction the mount must NOT step over: switching off a tool of the dashboard
# server. This harness carries it as a ``deny`` rule in the permission config Crew
# seeds (``registry.PerToolDeny.SETTINGS_FILE``), so the mount keeps its server and the
# harness hides the tool. Where that rule did not come out in force -- a lower config
# source outranked it -- the projection names the server in ``unhonoured_servers`` and
# ``AcpClient._member_mount_withheld`` withholds the mount, so that thread runs as plain
# chat rather than reaching a tool the operator switched off.
#
# Switching that server off WHOLE (``disabled``) is a stronger rule and carries no
# backend condition, because the form has no per-call spelling for any harness to
# refuse by (``acp.session_mcp.session_mcp_disabled_servers``). It binds on BOTH paths
# that compose a session's array -- ``AcpClient``'s, which opencode and claude take,
# and ``AcpRuntime``'s create and resume paths, which codex and KAS take -- so the
# operator's switch-off reaches a member session whichever one runs.
#
# goose is a member, and it holds the same two things opencode does:
#
#   * the per-session mount exists, on a RECORDED ROUND TRIP rather than on an
#     advertisement -- ``test/fixtures/acp_frames/goose/mcp-stdio-mount-live.jsonl``
#     (goose 1.50.1) carries one ``session/new`` element shaped as
#     ``acp.session_mcp`` emits, and the named child is asked ``initialize``,
#     ``notifications/initialized``, ``tools/list`` and ``tools/call`` with the tool's
#     own result coming back. So the element is MOUNTED and its tools are REACHABLE,
#     not merely accepted. The harness reads no agent file of Crew's, so that array is
#     the ONLY channel any tool set reaches it on;
#   * the session is GATED -- its routing is ``VERIFIED_SEEDED_SETTINGS``, one of the
#     three mechanisms in ``tool_gate.ENFORCED_ROUTINGS``. The asking mode is seeded on
#     the environment and READ BACK off the ``session/new`` response before the first
#     prompt, so a session that cannot establish the asking posture is REFUSED rather
#     than run.
#
# H6 again: opencode's membership establishes nothing here, so both facts are held for
# THIS harness. The mount asks for no owned permission file, and must not: the client's
# fallback answers for an UNENFORCED routing alone (``tool_gate.is_enforced`` is true for
# this one), and ``providers/mirrors/goose.py`` documents ``permission_surface_owned`` as
# accepted-and-ignored for that same reason -- the flag stands in for a read-back this
# harness performs, and no goose session owns a ``settings.local.json`` to satisfy it
# with.

# One thing is goose's ALONE, and it is why this membership carries a test of its own:
# goose is the only member of ``ACP_BACKENDS_META_IDENTITY``, so it is the only member
# whose every tool approval runs ``AcpClient._refuse_identity_drift``. That refusal
# judges a call's trusted server name against the names Crew PLACED on this session's
# array plus the harness's own builtin extension -- and the dashboard server is neither
# a builtin nor named by the agent template. It passes because both halves read the
# SAME array: the mount is appended inside ``_resolve_session_mcp_servers``, whose
# result is the cache ``_foreign_mcp_identity`` enumerates, so a server this session
# mounted is a placed server by construction. The identity goose reports for it is the
# element's own name (``_meta.goose.toolCall.extensionName``, the field the mount
# fixture pins for ``crew-probe``), so a dispatch call arrives as a placed server
# rather than as a drifted one.
#
# The per-tool rule binds here per call (``registry.PerToolDeny.PER_CALL``): the client
# refuses a switched-off dashboard tool at the permission request. Where goose's own
# ``permission.yaml`` pre-approves that tool the projection names the server in
# ``unhonoured_servers``, and the mount is withheld.
#
# pi is excluded on the evidence in ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_MCP_ARRAY``: the array is
# accepted and never forwarded to the agent, so a member dispatch mounted through it
# would be inert.
# deepseek is excluded, and since Crew's gate plugin was composed into it the ground
# is H6 alone. It has the mount -- it is a member of ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_MCP_ARRAY``
# -- and its routing (``Routing.VERIFIED_GATE_EXTENSION``, read back from the
# plugin's load marker before the first prompt) sits inside
# ``tool_gate.ENFORCED_ROUTINGS``, so both of codex's preconditions now hold where
# the second once failed. What it lacks is the DECISION for THIS harness: H6 is
# explicit that supporting one harness establishes nothing about another, and no
# member-dispatch round trip has been driven on it. A member session on it stays
# plain chat -- the dispatch tools are not mounted, never mounted-and-refused.
#
# WHERE the mount happens differs by backend, and opencode's is the client's.
# ``AcpClient._append_member_dispatch_server`` serves the backends whose array the
# CLIENT composes -- claude's and opencode's -- while codex and KAS are served by
# ``AcpRuntime``: their arrays come from ``AcpRuntime._mirrored_session_mcp`` and
# ``create_session`` / ``load_session`` append the entry themselves, on a non-empty
# ``member_session_key``. That key is where membership is read
# (``providers/acp.py`` ``_member_session_key``), which is why adding a backend here
# is the whole of the change for a runtime-served harness. Both establishment paths
# carry it, because ``session/load`` re-initializes a session's MCP servers and a
# resume that skipped the append would strip a member thread of its tools
# mid-conversation.
#
# The client path's own PRECONDITION is read from the routing rather than from one
# harness's flag: ``tool_gate.is_enforced``. A harness whose routing this core
# enforces needs nothing further -- an ungated session never reaches a prompt. A
# harness whose routing is declared-but-unenforced (claude) additionally needs Crew
# to OWN the session's native permission file, because a tool pre-approved in a file
# Crew does not own never sends ``session/request_permission`` and Crew's gate never
# fires. Reading the flag for a harness whose mirror documents it as
# accepted-and-ignored would withhold every member's tools on a condition that
# cannot describe that backend.

#
# Its own set, and its own argument, because H6 requires membership to be opted
# into PER CAPABILITY: supporting session control establishes nothing about the
# panel, so reusing ``ACP_BACKENDS_MEMBER_DISPATCH`` would grant a distinct
# capability on evidence gathered for a different one. The two memberships happen
# to coincide today; what must not coincide is the DECISION, and a backend added
# to one set does not join the other.
#
# The panel asks a SMALLER question than session control does, which is why every
# dispatch-capable harness also clears this one. Session control needs a
# server-side ownership fence (``created_by``) to bound which OTHER sessions a
# member may drive; the panel reaches no other session at all. ``panel_publish``
# takes no crew or session argument, resolves the publishing crew strictly from
# the calling session, and refuses a subagent, so the worst an auto-approved call
# can do is rewrite the caller's own drawer. What the panel still needs is exactly
# what makes an approval-free grant safe to project at all, and it is the same
# two preconditions the dispatch set is argued on:
#
# * a session-level ``mcpServers`` array this core composes, so the element can
#   carry the session identity the panel server's tool-policy read demands --
#   ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_MCP_ARRAY`` for the client-composed harnesses, and
#   ``AcpRuntime``'s own array for codex and KAS; and
# * a permission surface Crew either gates (``tool_gate.is_enforced``) or owns
#   (claude's ``settings.local.json``), so a verb Crew did not grant is not
#   silently pre-approved in a file Crew does not write.
#
# pi and deepseek are excluded for the reasons the dispatch set states and neither
# reason is about session control specifically: pi accepts the array and never
# forwards it, so a mounted panel server would be inert, and deepseek's routing is
# ``Routing.UNVERIFIED``, so a session that cannot be gated is never refused --
# projecting an approval-free grant onto a harness whose tool calls Crew does not
# decide is the thing both exclusions protect against.
#
# kiro is excluded and cannot be added by this set alone: a member session's key is
# what every mount reads, and ``providers/acp.py`` ``_member_session_key`` gates
# that key on ``ACP_BACKENDS_MEMBER_DISPATCH``. So this set decides whether a
# member session that EXISTS gets a panel; whether one exists at all is that
# gate's decision, and a backend must clear both.

# Backends implementing the ``_session/steer`` extension (mid-turn steer).
# claude-agent-acp does not implement it, so a steer sent there is answered with
# method-not-found rather than reaching the turn.
# codex-acp (1.11.0) has a steering channel, but not this one and not usable for
# what membership buys. Measured against a real adapter: it is a different method
# (``_session/steering``, ``{sessionId, prompt: [ContentBlock]}``, answered with
# ``{outcome: injected|startedNewTurn|failed}``, advertised as
# ``initialize._meta.steering.supported``) with no ``steering_consumed`` echo --
# and the one thing membership is for, handing a deny reason to the model INSIDE
# the turn that was denied, cannot happen on codex at all: its command approval
# advertises ``cancel`` as the ONLY reject option (no ``decline``), and answering
# it aborts the turn with ``stopReason: "cancelled"`` before the model is called
# again. A steer injected while the permission request is pending returns
# ``injected`` and is then discarded with the turn. So codex stays a non-member
# and takes the refusal-recovery continuation (see
# ``dashboard.state.should_queue_refusal_recovery``), which is the only channel
# that reaches its model.
# opencode is not a member either: its ``initialize`` result advertises
# ``sessionCapabilities`` of close, fork, list and resume, and nothing else.
# pi is not a member: pi-acp's ``initialize`` result advertises ``loadSession`` and
# ``sessionCapabilities`` of list and delete, and no steering extension.
# deepseek is not a member: it advertises close, list and resume only, and permits
# one in-flight prompt per session, so a mid-turn steer has no verb to travel on.
#
# This set answers the DENY-NOTICE question as well as the user one: a member's
# steer can carry a refusal reason into the turn that was refused. A backend that
# can take a USER's mid-turn message but not a deny notice belongs in
# ``ACP_BACKENDS_STEERING_REQUEST`` below instead, and the two questions are read
# off separate properties (``supports_steer`` and ``supports_refusal_steer``).

# Backends that take a USER's mid-turn message over codex-acp's
# ``_session/steering`` request rather than kiro-cli's ``_session/steer``.
#
# Measured against a live codex-acp 1.11.0: a steer sent while a prompt is in
# flight is answered ``{outcome: "injected"}`` within milliseconds and the running
# turn reads it; the same request with no turn running is answered
# ``{outcome: "startedNewTurn"}`` and the adapter runs a turn of its own that no
# ``session/prompt`` owns; ``session/cancel`` stops that turn and the next
# ``session/prompt`` runs normally. There is no ``steering_consumed`` echo, so the
# request's own answer is the delivery evidence.
#
# The session handle therefore AWAITS the answer (the kiro verb is
# fire-and-forget), until it arrives or the aimed-at turn ends: ``injected``
# settles the steer inside that turn, ``failed`` or no answer before the turn ends
# reports it undelivered so the caller queues it as the next turn, and
# ``startedNewTurn`` is cancelled first so the text cannot run twice. The result
# is at-least-once: codex orders the answer against the turn's terminal in no
# way, so a steer injected just as its turn ends can be queued as well and run a
# second time, visibly, as its own turn. Only the
# shared-runtime path speaks it -- ``AcpSessionHandle`` -- because only there can
# a request be awaited without competing with the turn for the adapter's stdout.
#
# Deliberately NOT ``ACP_BACKENDS_STEER``: the deny-notice path needs a steer
# that survives the refusal, and codex discards an injected steer with a turn
# its approval answer cancels (see the note above).
#
# The same discard reaches a user steer already accepted into the turn, when a
# LATER approval is denied or the turn is cancelled. So a codex steer is reported
# consumed only when its turn ends cleanly, and otherwise the caller's pending
# entry for it is queued by the turn's teardown. Only the dashboard composer keeps
# such an entry, so membership here also means ``steer_needs_loss_recovery``: the
# provider wrapper that the messaging channels, Side Chat and ``spawn_steer``
# steer refuses, so those queue instead.

# Backends that can serve a MANUAL ``/compact`` (the user-typed slash command).
# Every member acts on the ``/compact`` prompt that ``AcpProvider.compact()``
# sends. They do not all answer it the same way, and that split is
# ``ACP_BACKENDS_INLINE_COMPACTION``: kiro-cli ACKs the prompt then emits
# ``_kiro.dev/compaction/status``, which ``wait_for_compaction()`` picks up, while
# claude-agent-acp, codex-acp, opencode and goose finish the whole compaction inside
# the ``session/prompt`` turn.
#
# opencode is a member on a LIVE capture against opencode 1.18.30, and it joins
# despite advertising nothing: its ``available_commands_update`` lists only
# ``customize-opencode``, ``init`` and ``review``. That silence was read here as "no
# compaction capability of any kind", and it is not one -- the harness serves
# ``/compact`` out of its PROMPT handler rather than out of its command list, so the
# command list cannot answer the question. Driven over four turns the session's
# ``usage_update.used`` climbed 14863 -> 15727 -> 16614 -> 17478. A ``/compact``
# prompt then returned ``stopReason: end_turn`` with no status frame of any kind,
# and the next ORDINARY turn read 14577 -- below the pre-compact peak -- with the
# model answering out of a summary of the turns that were dropped. So the context
# really shrank, and the turn's own terminal frame is the only done signal there is.
# The single-turn slice of that drive is committed as evidence rather than quoted:
# ``test/fixtures/acp_frames/opencode/compact-live.jsonl`` carries the ordinary
# turn, the ``/compact`` turn's ``used: 514``, and the ``end_turn`` with nothing
# after it -- which is the ABSENCE this membership rests on.
#
# codex is a member on a capture rather than on its documentation. codex-acp 1.11.0
# driven over stdio advertises ``compact`` in its ``available_commands_update``
# ("Summarize conversation to avoid hitting the context limit"), intercepts the
# ``/compact`` prompt as that command, and answers the same ``session/prompt``
# request once the compaction is done. The frames are a MARKED tool-call pair --
# ``_meta.contextCompaction`` -- which ``_dispatch.parse_codex_compaction_update``
# translates into the compaction status every consumer already reads, so the waiter
# is satisfied from inside the turn rather than stranded after it. Its native
# auto-compaction is real but CONDITIONAL: with ``model_auto_compact_token_limit``
# set it fires on its own and emits the same marked pair, and with the limit absent a
# session held at 50k tokens across three turns compacted not once. So the old
# "manages compaction automatically" promise was true only for an operator who had
# configured it.
#
# goose is a member on a LIVE capture against goose 1.50.1. Driven over three turns,
# its ``usage_update.used`` climbed 1529 -> 1991 -> 2453. A ``/compact`` prompt then
# answered ``Compaction complete`` inside the turn, read ``used: 224``, and returned
# ``stopReason: end_turn`` with no status frame after it. The next ORDINARY turn read
# 1749, below the pre-compact peak. The drive is committed as evidence:
# ``test/fixtures/acp_frames/goose/compact-live.jsonl``. Its source agreed before the
# drive did: ``Agent::reply`` routes ``/compact`` through ``execute_command`` to
# ``handle_compact_command``, and ``command_starts_turn("/compact")`` is false.
#
# pi is NOT a member, and the reason is the evidence CLASS rather than the feature.
# It advertises a ``compact`` built-in and dispatches it before any model turn --
# pi-acp 0.0.33 intercepts it in ``prompt()``, awaits ``session.proc.compact(...)``
# and returns ``{ stopReason: "end_turn" }``. So the source says inline.
#
# What it lacks is a driven capture, and this set asks for one: the bar opencode and
# goose met is a live session whose ``usage_update.used`` was seen to fall. Source
# says what the code WOULD do; a capture says what the harness DID. For a membership
# whose wrong answer makes ``wait_for_compaction`` report a completion that did not
# happen, the second is the bar, and holding every member to it is what keeps this
# set's memberships comparable to each other. pi could not be driven where this was
# written -- it answers ``Authentication required`` -- so it waits for someone who can
# drive it rather than entering on the weaker class.
#
# Until then pi is unclassified, which is a better position than the one it held: it
# takes the ``COMPACT_ARM_UNCLASSIFIED`` refusal, which promises nothing, and the gate
# logs a WARNING naming the memberships it lacks, instead of being told its harness
# manages compaction itself on no evidence at all.
#
# kas and deepseek are the other two non-members, and none of the four is the same
# case.
# :data:`ACP_BACKENDS_HARNESS_MANAGED_COMPACTION` carries the difference and the

# declining its ``/compact`` costs nothing, while deepseek says nothing at all, so a
# decline leaves its context unbounded.

#
# This is the set that makes a decline HONEST. A backend outside
# :data:`ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT` cannot be handed a ``/compact`` prompt, and the
# question that remains is what happens instead. A member answers it: KAS runs
# auto-summarization and emits ``summarization_started`` /
# ``summarization_completed``, which ``acp.kas_wire`` maps to a compaction status and
# which calls ``reset_after_compaction()`` on the meter
# (``acp/session_handle.py``) -- so the reading that crossed
# ``session.autocompact_pct`` drops on its own and the user-facing "manages
# compaction automatically" is a description rather than a hope. A backend outside
# BOTH this set and ``ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT`` has no compaction path Crew can see on
# any surface, so skipping it is not a decline but a leak: nothing bounds the context
# and nothing tells the user. What Crew does about that is decided by a THIRD
# membership, :data:`ACP_BACKENDS_CONTEXT_RECYCLE` -- a member of that set is
# recycled at the threshold, and a backend in none of the three is declined and
# logged at WARNING, because ending a conversation is not something a harness earns
# by never having been classified.
#
# deepseek is the standing non-member and the reason this set exists, and the frames
# that establish it are in the corpus rather than quoted here:
# ``test/fixtures/acp_frames/deepseek/handshake-live.jsonl`` and
# ``turn-live.jsonl``. What those frames establish is an ACP surface with no
# compaction on it: no ``available_commands_update`` is emitted at all,
# ``session/load`` answers ``"Method not found"``, and the advertised capabilities are
# ``mcpCapabilities`` / ``promptCapabilities`` / ``sessionCapabilities`` -- no
# compaction anything. Whether the harness summarizes for ITSELF behind that surface
# is not established here, and is deliberately claimed in neither direction: the
# capture stops at ``used`` 7695 of ``size`` 8192, so it is evidence about 94% of the
# window and says nothing about the wall. Driving deepseek across its own window is
# tracked separately. The membership rests on the observable half, which is the half
# Crew acts on: there is no status to wait for and no command to send, so a reading
# that crossed ``session.autocompact_pct`` would be answered by nothing here however
# the harness behaves at the wall. Meanwhile its ``usage_update`` reports a real
# meter, climbing ``used`` 7554 -> 7695 of ``size`` 8192 across ONE captured turn: a
# reading Crew can act on with nowhere to act. Those two files are the whole basis of this membership, which is an ABSENCE --
# an inventory question, unlike ``ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT``'s positive capability claim,
# which is why that set needs a harness DRIVEN and this one does not.
#
# A harness that joins NEITHER this set nor ``ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT`` is DECLINED at
# the threshold, not recycled. The recycle is its own membership,
# :data:`ACP_BACKENDS_CONTEXT_RECYCLE`, because granting the one session-ending arm
# by exclusion would be the same unproven claim this set exists to remove, only
# louder. What such a harness gets instead is a WARNING from the gate naming both
# memberships it lacks, and the refusal arm that promises nothing -- so the leak is
# reported rather than either denied or answered by ending the conversation. pi is
# that case today.

# The third of three answers to "what happens when this context fills", and the

# A member is a harness Crew cannot hand ``/compact`` to
# (:data:`ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT`) AND that reports no compaction of its own
# (:data:`ACP_BACKENDS_HARNESS_MANAGED_COMPACTION`), so its context grows until the
# harness's own window ends the conversation for it. Recycling at
# ``session.autocompact_pct`` bounds it, at the cost of what the agent remembered
# — the same cost the window exacts anyway, taken while the session is still
# usable.
#
# deepseek is the one member. Its ACP surface emits no
# ``available_commands_update`` at all (``session/load`` is already
# ``Method not found``) and its ``session/update`` vocabulary carries no compaction
# status, while its ``usage_update`` reports a real meter (``used`` 7554 -> 7695 of
# ``size`` 8192 in one captured turn) — a reading with nowhere to go.
#
# A harness in NONE of the three sets is deliberately not a member here. Granting
# this by exclusion would hand a session-destroying behaviour to every harness
# added later without anyone deciding it, which is the same defect as claiming
# self-management on no evidence — only louder, because this arm ends
# conversations. Such a harness declines like a harness-managed one and is told so
# in its own words (:func:`compact_unsupported_reply` has a third sentence for
# exactly this case), and the gate logs a WARNING naming the gap, so the condition
# is reported rather than silent while somebody decides which set it belongs in.

#
# A STRICT SUBSET of ``ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT``, which answers the earlier question
# "is a manual /compact offered at all". kas and deepseek are in neither. kiro-cli
# is in ``ACP_BACKENDS_COMPACT`` but not here: it ACKs the prompt and then emits
# ``_kiro.dev/compaction/status``, which is exactly the asynchronous result this
# set says a non-member has. codex-acp IS a member, and its evidence is the same
# capture: the ``tool_call_update`` carrying ``status: "completed"`` and
# ``_meta.contextCompaction`` arrives BEFORE the ``session/prompt`` response, and
# that response is a plain ``stopReason: "end_turn"`` with no compaction status
# following it. So the turn's terminal is the done signal, exactly as it is for
# claude.
#
# Named as a set rather than spelled as an ``is_claude_backend`` check, because an

# KAS is NOT a member even though Crew now spawns it as ``kiro-cli acp

#
# codex-acp is excluded on the same rule: it is a Node adapter, so Crew's own layer
# is the only OS confinement a codex session gets. The Codex sandbox modes the
# adapter can apply are in-process policy, not an OS sandbox that Crew's would
# nest inside.
#
# opencode is excluded, and here the exclusion is load-bearing rather than
# conservative: Crew's own sandbox layer carries the credential mask that is the
# compensating control for this harness's passive reads, so skipping that layer
# would remove the control. It carries no OS sandbox of its own to replace it.
#
# pi is excluded on the same load-bearing ground, and its own documentation says
# so in as many words: pi has no built-in sandbox and runs tools with the
# permissions of its process. Crew's layer is the only one there is.
# deepseek is excluded on that same load-bearing ground, and the thing that makes it
# tempting is exactly what makes it wrong: its composition DOES mount a sandbox of
# its own, and Crew even pins that sandbox's mode. But it confines the harness's own
# tool executors from inside the same process -- it is not an OS sandbox that Crew's
# seatbelt would nest inside, and it does not carry Crew's credential mask. Skipping
# Crew's layer for it would drop the compensating control for its passive reads.

#
# deepseek is not a member, and it is the first harness excluded here whose own
# protocol would support membership: one of its connections carries several
# independent sessions. ``AcpRuntime`` is not a general multiplexer, though -- it
# carries the kiro-family spawn argv, the cli.json effort and Tool Search overlay,
# and the ``_kiro/*`` auth and delete verbs -- so serving this harness from it means
# a demux that is not kiro-shaped, which is its own work. It takes the AcpClient

#
# ``ACP_BACKEND_CODEX`` IS a member, and it is the first one that is not
# kiro-shaped. It earns membership on the two facts a shared process needs, both
# captured off a live ``codex-acp`` 1.11.0 against a real ``codex`` build:
#
# * one adapter process serves N sessions and keeps them apart. Two
#   ``session/new`` calls on one connection return distinct ids, and across a
#   prompt on one of them every ``session/update`` notification carries that
#   session's id -- none leaks to the other.
# * the adapter itself does not grow with sessions: 103 MB at zero sessions and
#   85 MB at eight. The growth is in ``codex app-server``, and it is gentle
#   (+14 MB per session on a minimal config, +37 MB with a host MCP registry).
#
# What it does NOT bring is the kiro-family spawn convention: it reads no
# cli.json overlay and takes effort through ``session/set_config_option``. That
# is why membership here is a statement about the TRANSPORT and nothing else --
# every kiro-family convention is its own set, and codex is absent from each.

    """The overlay-lookup scope keywords for *backend*'s session.

    The ONE decider, so every call site that resolves the overlay -- ``AcpClient``
    and ``AcpRuntime`` alike -- answers from
    :data:`ACP_BACKENDS_USER_LEVEL_AGENT_SPECS_ONLY` rather than from its own
    spelling. A host reading the user level alone joins the set and both paths
    change together; the alternative, one path keyed on the set and the other
    hardcoding the session's checkout, silently mis-scopes the next such host,
    which is the defect this function exists to make unreachable.

    Returned as keywords to SPLAT, because the checkout is not the whole scope:
    which spec FORMATS this session's agent resolution SEES is the other half. A
    project spec shadows the user-level overlay only in a form that resolution
    honours, and the two halves must name the same file.

    ``markdown_specs`` and ``dispatchable_only`` are two facets of ONE question --
    which resolver decides this session's agent spec -- so they are computed here
    together rather than derived from each other at a call site.

    A MIRRORED host's array is composed by Crew from a spec ``acp.session_mcp``
    resolves through ``_project_spec_path_for``: it scans both forms and matches on
    ``agent_discovery.project_agent_name``, which falls back to the filename stem.
    So the overlay lookup must match the same way -- both forms, no parse
    requirement. That is not a formality: when that resolver matches a project file
    it returns that file's read and does NOT fall back to the user level, so a
    MALFORMED project spec leaves the projection with no spec at all, no ``tools``
    allowlist and no project servers. Keeping the user-level stubs on top of that
    would put servers in the session that nothing in force declares.

    kiro-cli instead resolves ``--agent`` from the checkout ITSELF, discovers the
    JSON form there (measured on 2.22.0, and pinned by the
    ``KIROCREW_E2E_REAL_KIRO_CLI``-gated test), and reports a malformed spec as an
    error offering no such mode -- so it runs the user-level agent, whose stubs must
    therefore be kept. Hence JSON only, and a parse required.

    :data:`ACP_BACKENDS_MARKDOWN_AGENT_SPECS` -- a host reading the markdown form
    from a checkout itself -- is deliberately NOT OR-ed in: its only member also
    reads the user level alone and leaves above, so the term would have no caller
    able to reach it. ``test_agent_sdk_capabilities`` pins that containment, so a
    host which breaks it fails there naming this function.

    The import is deferred because the mirror registry imports THIS module at its
    own top level. It is not wrapped: an import that does not resolve is a
    packaging fault, and answering "kiro-shaped" for a mirrored host because of one
    would silently reinstate the stub-shadowing this scope exists to prevent.

    ``work_dir`` is passed through untouched (``str``, ``Path`` or ``None``) so
    the caller keeps whichever form it already holds.

# "resumes an existing session without returning previous messages (unlike
# ``session/load``)", and is "useful for agents that can resume sessions but don't
# implement full session loading". So a member is not a harness with a quirk to
# accommodate -- it is a harness serving the optional method the specification
# provides for exactly this case.
#
# A SET plus a method constant rather than a driver method, because the two calls
# have the same contract: ``ResumeSessionRequest`` carries the same fields as
# ``LoadSessionRequest`` (session id, cwd, MCP servers, additional directories,
# ``_meta``), and ``ResumeSessionResponse`` carries the same fields as
# ``LoadSessionResponse`` (optional modes, optional config options, ``_meta``). Only
# two reads differ -- which capability advertises the verb, and which verb is sent --
# so a per-harness method would be a function whose one difference is a string, and
# harness-parity H13 keeps the shared restore path free of a conditional added in

# Membership decides BOTH reads together on purpose. A harness that advertises the

# or advertise both and mean one; sniffing hands the choice to whatever the agent said
# on the day, with no record of what Crew verified and no place to write down why. The

# ── How a harness is made to ask ──

# per tool call is a harness where none of those controls execute. So "how is this

# named here rather than assumed at each call site.


class Routing(str, Enum):
    """The mechanism that makes a harness ask before it runs a tool.

    ``AGENT_SPEC`` -- the spawn names an agent, so the harness asks by
    construction and there is nothing to probe or apply.

    ``SESSION_CONFIG`` -- the ACP v1 session advertises a config option whose
    enforced value makes privileged tools ask. Kiro Crew verifies the option is
    advertised and applies it before the first prompt.

    ``SEEDED_SETTINGS`` -- the harness is made to ask by a settings file Kiro
    Crew writes, so the precondition would be confirmable by reading back what was
    written. **Declared but not enforced by this core**, because that read-back
    does not exist. ``AcpClient._write_claude_local_settings`` does seed
    ``permissions.defaultMode``, but it is a CONDITIONAL write: it touches only the
    file Crew owns (created this session, bytes still Crew's) and otherwise leaves
    the path alone, and nothing confirms the adapter honoured the mode afterwards.
    So a ``bypassPermissions`` already present in a user's own
    ``settings.local.json`` or ``~/.claude`` is neither detected nor stripped, and
    the guarantee cannot be asserted. Recorded as a known gap rather than papered
    over with a ``ROUTED`` this core cannot earn -- see
    ``docs/system-specs/modules/harness-onboarding.md``.

    ``VERIFIED_SEEDED_SETTINGS`` -- the harness is made to ask by a setting Kiro
    Crew supplies as the session starts, AND the precondition is confirmed by
    reading the harness's OWN RESOLVED configuration back before the first prompt.
    The read-back is the whole difference from ``SEEDED_SETTINGS``, and it is what
    this mechanism can assert that the other cannot: a value the harness's own
    config already carried, or a seed that did not take effect, is OBSERVED rather
    than assumed. Where the read-back cannot confirm the required value the verdict
    is INDETERMINATE and the session is refused, so a harness whose own default is
    permissive cannot present a gate that gates nothing.

    Where the setting TRAVELS is the driver's business, not this vocabulary's, and
    it is not necessarily a file: the one member today passes it as inline config in
    the child's environment, which that harness resolves above its own project
    config file -- so a session establishes the guarantee without writing anything
    into a checked-out repository.

    ``VERIFIED_GATE_EXTENSION`` -- the harness has NO gate of its own to configure,
    so Kiro Crew loads one INTO it: an extension Crew ships, passed on the
    harness's own command line at spawn, that intercepts every tool call and
    raises the harness's confirm dialog, which the adapter forwards as
    ``session/request_permission``. The precondition -- that the harness loaded
    Crew's extension, from Crew's file -- is VERIFIED before the first prompt by
    asking the harness's own command registry: the extension registers a probe
    command, and the read-back requires that command to be present and to name
    the shipped file as its source. A harness that did not load it, or loaded a
    different file under the same name, is refused. Like the member above, this
    proves the precondition and not the per-call emission; the frame corpus
    carries the observation of the latter.

    The extension is Crew's own code executing inside a third-party process with
    that process's permissions. That is a new trust boundary and it is stated
    here rather than assumed: the file is read-only package data, the harness is
    told its absolute path, and nothing the agent says can change which file is
    named.

    ``UNVERIFIED`` -- Kiro Crew has NOT established how, or whether, this harness
    can be made to ask. This member exists so "we do not know" is a state a
    caller must handle rather than an absent case that falls through to a
    permissive branch. It always resolves INDETERMINATE, which refuses.

    present before the first prompt -- but the QUESTION has to be asked in the

    is that difference, kept as data beside the routing table so a third harness
    is a row rather than a branch in the verdict.

    ``COMMAND_REGISTRY`` -- ask the harness. The extension registers a command and
    the harness's own registry reports it with the file it was loaded from, so the
    WITNESS is the harness: Crew reads back an answer it did not author. This is
    the stronger of the two and is preferred wherever a harness offers it.

    ``LOAD_MARKER`` -- ask Crew's own code, because the harness offers nothing to
    ask. The plugin writes one file at a path Crew names in the child's
    environment, carrying the probe name, the per-session nonce Crew issued, and
    its own resolved module URL. Present-with-this-nonce-and-this-module proves
    the plugin Crew shipped was composed, from Crew's file, in THIS session --
