"""Turn off git's config-defined hooks for one host-side git call.

Git 2.54 runs hooks named in config, not just hook files::

    [hook "x"]
        command = <any shell command>
        event = pre-commit

``-c core.hooksPath=<devnull>`` only moves the hook DIRECTORY, so these still
run. A repository's own ``.git/config`` is writable by whoever edits the tree,
so a host-side git call over an agent-writable tree would run that command
outside the sandbox. They fire on ordinary porcelain: ``add``, ``commit``,
``checkout``, ``worktree add``, ``push``, ``fetch``, ``update-ref``, and even
``status`` when it refreshes the index (``post-index-change``).

There is no switch that turns them all off. ``hook.<event>.enabled=false``
(git 2.55+) is ignored when the same ``<event>`` is also used as a hook name,
which the repository can arrange. ``hook.<name>.enabled=false`` works on every
version that has config hooks, but only for a name we know. So each call first
lists the names git will see and disables each one by name. Older git ignores
the extra keys.

Every scope is disabled, not just the repository's: the callers already point
``core.hooksPath`` at the null device, so the user's own hooks never ran on
these calls either.

The list is read just before the call, by a separate process, so a writer that
is running at the same moment can add a new name in between. That is the same
limit the ``.git/info/attributes`` pin in
:mod:`kiro_crew.apps.builtins.auto_improvement.spine.git_safety` has.
