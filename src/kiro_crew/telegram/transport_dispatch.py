"""Full new-path dispatch: TelegramTransport -> TurnDriver -> TelegramRenderer.

``TelegramTransport.receive()`` authorizes + normalizes an inbound update and
hands the ``InboundMessage`` to :meth:`TelegramDispatcher.handle_message`,
which mirrors the Slack transport dispatch:

    command intercept (/new, /compact, /model, /yolo, /help)
    -> construct TelegramRenderer + on_turn_start (immediate ack placeholder)
    -> session acquire -> context build
    -> TurnDriver.run(provider, renderer)   # shared redaction + approval ladder
    -> post-turn (record_success, persist, soft-threshold notice)  # each guarded
    -> renderer.close() + session release   # in finally

``on_callback`` resolves interactive tool approvals (``a:<rid>:<1|0>`` ->
``TelegramApprovalDecider.resolve_global``), applies ``/model`` picks
(``m:<index>``) and re-injects provenance-tagged ``[OPTIONS:]`` choices
(``opt:<index>:<session-tag>``) as literal fresh turns.

Dependency direction is ``telegram -> messaging`` (allowed). The security
``tool_gate`` and spawn auto-approve are wired inline off ``ctx_builder.hooks``
(channel-neutral) so this module never imports ``kiro_crew.slack``.

``TelegramDispatcher`` is composed from owners in :mod:`kiro_crew.telegram.dispatch`:
queued-origin identity (``origin``), forum activation and reply targeting
(``addressing``), the mid-turn steer-or-queue arm (``midturn``), the ``/model`` and
``/agent`` pickers (``pickers``), inline-button routing (``callbacks``), spawn-approval
delivery (``spawn_approval``), command handlers (``commands``) and spoken replies
(``voice``). Each owner's methods are bound below as class attributes of the same
name. This module keeps the dispatcher's state, the inbound front door
(``handle_message``) and turn engine (``_run_turn``), the queue drain and receipt
wrappers, ``/stop``, ``/title``, the transcript write and the conversation-identity
helpers, because repository guards read them in this file; it stays the only import
path and patch surface. ``# noqa: F401`` marks an import an owner reads through this
module at call time, or one this module's name surface keeps. Which owner takes new
work is recorded in ``docs/system-specs/modules/messaging.md`` (Telegram channel).

        drain path needs it: it re-enters with ``interpret_commands=False``, on text
        the modifier was already stripped from, so without it a
        ``/temporary <question>`` that had to queue would run unprotected.

        *origin_tag* is the posting session encoded into an ``[OPTIONS:]``
        button. A non-empty tag makes that button valid only while the current
        and final post-rotation session keys still match it. The choice is never
        queued or steered, because those paths retain text but not provenance.

        into ONE combined turn (order preserved, blank-line joined) and answer them
        together, rather than replaying each as a separate turn.

        The dequeue + receipt flip run together under ``self._queue.lock`` so a
        concurrent mid-turn ``_enqueue_with_receipt`` (which takes the same lock)
        cannot interleave and leave an orphaned receipt. The combined turn itself
        runs OUTSIDE the lock -- messages that arrive during it open a fresh
        receipt and drain after the next turn. Only the queued text is replayed
        (matching what ``enqueue`` persists for DM channels: text only).

        One combined turn gets ONE envelope, so it may only combine messages that
        SHARE one -- same sender, same chat, same Topic. That is
        :attr:`_QueuedOrigin.sender_key`, and it is taken from the FIRST entry this
        iteration collapses, never from the turn that opened the queue: under
        ``dm_scope = "unified"`` one session key, and therefore one queue, is shared
        by every allow-listed person, so a queue holding two of them is reachable on
        the live path. Anything from a different sender or place defers itself and
        everything behind it, so FIFO stays exact and the outer loop drains it next
        as its own turn under its own envelope.

        Which is why this method is given the session key and nothing else: the
        opener's identity is not an input it could accidentally fall back to.

        An entry ANOTHER transport recorded shares this queue under the same scope and
        cannot be answered here at all. It is set aside, and because it has already
        been accepted and receipted, its owner's drain is woken once this pump is done

        ``auto_title_pending`` says a generated name is on its way for this
        conversation, so the deterministic fallback below is skipped: auto-title's
        guard refuses a record that already carries a name, so writing one here
        would make the first forty characters of the first message the permanent
        name and retain the claim, leaving nothing to retry. The caller decides it
        once and uses the same value for its own dispatch, so the two cannot
        disagree. It defaults to False, so a caller that does not dispatch
        auto-title writes the fallback unconditionally.

        ``privacy_mode.is_restricted`` is this channel's OWN privacy gate and is
        checked here, at the only writer, so it covers the turn, the drained queue
        and the steered continuation alike.

        It is NOT the whole ceiling for a RESUMED dashboard session. That
        predicate reads a process-local tracker which only an inbound CHANNEL
        message populates, so it answers ``False`` for an incognito dashboard slot
        and fails open. That rung is decided by the CALLER, through
        :meth:`_session_restricted`, which skips this call entirely — it needs the
        live slot registry and, failing that, an await on the persisted transcript,
        neither reachable from the worker thread this runs in. A second caller must
        make the same check before calling.
