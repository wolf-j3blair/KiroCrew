    Staging must pin its hardlink check to the SAME inode it reads.
    A caller that lstat()s the path and then opens it by name leaves a race
    window where the file is swapped for a hardlink to a sensitive file
    (e.g. ``~/.aws/config``) between the check and the open. Here the open
    happens first, refusing a link at the final component, then ``fstat()`` on
    the descriptor —
    the inode that is validated is exactly the inode that is read:
    ``st_nlink > 1`` or a non-regular file type is rejected.

    When ``within_root`` is given, the OPENED descriptor's real path
    (via ``/proc/self/fd`` on Linux, ``fcntl.F_GETPATH`` on macOS, or
    ``GetFinalPathNameByHandleW`` on Windows) must resolve inside that root and
    must not be sensitive. Refusing the link only guards the
    FINAL path component — a nested directory swapped for a symlink between
    the tree walk and the open would silently escape the approved tree. The
    fd-path check is pinned to the inode actually opened, so no check-to-use
    window remains. If the fd's real path cannot be determined, fail closed.
    ``within_root_is_canonical`` preserves a caller's already-resolved admission
    root literally, so replacing that directory with a link cannot redefine it.

    ``admit_hardlinked`` is the one opt-in exception to the hardlink refusal, and
    it is decided on CONTENT, never on the link count alone. A hardlinked inode
    still passes every other check here (regular file, opened-path identity,
    containment, sensitive path, size cap); then the callback receives the
    validated path and the exact bytes read from the descriptor, and only a
    ``True`` answer returns them. Without it, ``st_nlink > 1`` is refused as
    before.

    That final-component refusal comes from
    :func:`kiro_crew.platform_compat.open_file_no_reparse`, not from an
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` flag, because the flag does not exist on Windows:
    ``getattr(os, "O_NOFOLLOW", 0)`` is ``0`` there, so a plain ``os.open``
    resolves a junction at the name and this chokepoint would hold one fewer
    guarantee on one platform than the paragraph above claims. ``CreateFileW``
    with ``FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`` opens the reparse point AS ITSELF and
    the helper reports ``ELOOP``, which is what POSIX reports for the same
    shape, so the open is one operation with one contract everywhere.

    Returns file content as bytes, or None if the path is rejected,
    hardlinked, non-regular, escaping ``within_root``, or unreadable.

    """Copy a file into *dest_dir* with the full descriptor-pinned validation
    chain; return the private copy's path, or None if the source is rejected.

    For large binaries (media files) that libraries must consume BY PATH from
    a subprocess: the bytes are streamed from the vetted descriptor into a
    freshly created 0600 temp file inside *dest_dir*, so downstream readers
    never touch the caller-influenced original path again.

    Validation mirrors :func:`safe_read_file_bytes_nolink`: open first, refusing a
    link at the final component, then ``fstat()`` on the descriptor (regular file,
    ``st_nlink == 1``), then the OPENED descriptor's real path (via
    ``/proc/self/fd`` on Linux, ``fcntl.F_GETPATH`` on macOS,
    ``GetFinalPathNameByHandleW`` on Windows) must not be sensitive. Refusing the
    link only guards the FINAL path component — an ancestor directory swapped for a
    symlink between validation and open would otherwise reach a sensitive file. The
    fd-path check is pinned to the inode actually opened and copied, so no
    check-to-use window remains. If the fd's real path cannot be determined, fail
    closed.

    The open goes through :func:`kiro_crew.platform_compat.open_file_no_reparse`
    because this function copies BYTES with a raw ``os.read``, and both halves of
    that matter on Windows: ``O_NOFOLLOW`` does not exist there, so a plain
    ``os.open`` follows a reparse point at the name AND hands back a CRT descriptor
    in text mode, which truncates a binary payload at its first ``0x1A``. Media
    files — what this function exists for — are exactly the payloads that carry one.
