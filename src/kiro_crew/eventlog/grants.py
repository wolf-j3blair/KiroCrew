"""Who may read, append and publish on a unit's log.

One question per function, each answered from the app's own manifest
``contributions`` declaration, intersected for unit kinds with what an operator
approved. The HTTP handlers and the WebSocket hub both call these, so the answer
cannot differ between the two surfaces.

Four properties are deliberate:

* **Disabled means denied.** An app token survives a disable (the secret is not
  rotated), so every answer here first asks whether the app is enabled --
  mirroring ``ws_event_scope.app_events_revoked``, which exists for the same
  reason on the frame side.
* **Reading is per kind, not per event type** (contract §2). A subscriber sees
  every event of a unit it may subscribe to, which is why the contract puts
  sensitive data in the durable store an event points at rather than in the
  event.
* **The prefix rule is re-checked at use, not trusted from install.** A manifest
  is a file on disk that an app trusted to run code can rewrite, so a pattern
  that does not begin with the app's own name is ignored here even though
  ``AppManifest.validate`` would have refused it at install time.
* **A unit KIND is authority, so it is not taken from the manifest alone.** The
  rule above cannot guard ``units``: a kind is not namespaced -- ``member`` is the
  gateway's -- so there is no prefix for a pattern to fail. An app that rewrote
  its own manifest to add ``units: ["member"]`` would otherwise have granted
  itself read over a member's whole log. Declared kinds are therefore intersected
  with :func:`apps.manager.approved_unit_kinds`, which answers from a
  gateway-owned record OUTSIDE every app's own tree, so a kind must be both still
  declared AND already approved. The record's location is the point: an approval
  kept inside the app's directory would be writable by the very app it limits.

#: that window WITHOUT a new CLI->gateway authority channel (there is none when

    a contributor's type is ``<app>/<name>`` with a namespace the built-ins do
    not own **because "an app cannot be named for one of these"** -- but nothing
    enforces that premise, since ``app_name_error`` reserves no namespace names.
    So an app installed as ``member`` declaring ``events: ["member/*"]`` passes
    ``Contributions.validate`` (the prefix matches its own name, ``member`` is a
    known kind) and its declaration then matches ``member/binding``, which is in
    ``ALL_EVENT_TYPES`` and which ``RosterProjection`` folds AUTHORITATIVELY --
    letting a contributor overwrite gateway-owned roster fields it never owned.

    Checking the type here is what the helper's own docstring asks for: it is
    syntax only, and "WHETHER a given app may append it is authority, decided at
    the HTTP boundary against that app's declared ``contributions.events``".
