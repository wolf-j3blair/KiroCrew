"""MemberEventLogService — the one door to per-member append-only logs.

Contract (implemented in this module; callers import only from here):

    svc = get_service()                       # lazy singleton rooted at the member crew log root
    svc.attach_broadcast(state.broadcast_ws)  # once, at dashboard startup
    svc.ensure(slug, name)                    # create the log + header if missing (migrates legacy files)
    ev = svc.append(slug, type, data)         # write + fsync, fold projections, push member_projection frames
    svc.snapshot(slug)                        # {"asOfSeq": int, "values": {key: view}}
    svc.history(slug, before=None, limit=50)  # newest-first page of envelopes
    svc.last_seq(slug)                        # 0 for an empty log
    svc.last_seqs()                           # {slug: last_seq} for every known log
    svc.slugs()                               # every member with a log on disk

All methods are synchronous. A write is one line appended under a per-slug
lock and fsync'd before it returns; projections fold in the same call and the
broadcast is only enqueued. Callers on the event loop pay one fsync per
append, which is the pilot's accepted cost.

    The answer is what the unit's own removal is gated on, so it is true only when
    none of the four names is left -- including one left deliberately, because a name
    that is a link is a name the fold can still read through. Anything short of that
    reports false, and the caller then keeps the unit, which keeps the marker that
    stops the fold reading what survived here.
    The companion to removing a member's unit. These rows are the member's own
    history from before the log existed, and they sit OUTSIDE the unit while the
    marker recording that they were folded sits inside it -- so taking the unit
    alone both leaves the history on disk and re-arms the fold, because the next
    fresh ``ensure`` finds no marker and reads the source again. Every name the
    fold reads is covered: the live file, its one rotation, and the retired names
    the fold renames them to.

    **The directory is PINNED to a descriptor and the leaves are unlinked by
    BASENAME against it, so there is no window between deciding and deleting.**
    ``member_dir`` resolves and then only containment-checks the result, so
    ``members/<slug>`` swapped for a link to a PEER's directory resolves inside the
    members root, passes that check, and hands back the peer's real directory --
    where these four names are ordinary files, so a link test on the leaves is false
    and the unlink destroys a live member's history. For a member whose fold has not
    run that file is the sole copy. ``members/<slug>`` is deliberately agent-writable,
    which is what makes the swap reachable rather than hypothetical.

    A test on the name cannot close that, whatever it tests FOR: the test and the
    unlink are separate syscalls, and whoever can plant the link chooses when to
    plant it. ``platform_compat.pin_directory`` refuses a link AS IT OPENS -- POSIX
    through ``O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW``, Windows by opening a reparse point as
    itself -- so the refusal is the open rather than a prediction about it, and it
    answers for a junction as well as a symlink. Every unlink then names a basename
    against that descriptor, so it resolves against the directory that was inspected
    and a later swap of the NAME reaches nothing. Windows has no ``dir_fd``; there
    the same handle is what closes the window, because a directory held open without
    ``FILE_SHARE_DELETE`` can be neither renamed nor deleted, nor can any directory
    above it, so the by-path unlink under that hold cannot be redirected either.

    **``O_NOFOLLOW`` binds the FINAL component only, so the members ROOT is pinned
    first and the slug is opened relative to it.** ``members_root()`` is an
    unresolved path under the data home, and nothing seals the ``members`` component
    itself -- swapped for a link, it redirects an open of ``members/<slug>`` however
    carefully that leaf is no-followed, and the four unlinks land in a tree outside
    the member area entirely. Two pins settle it: the root refuses a link as it
    opens, and the slug is then opened THROUGH that descriptor, so neither name is
    re-resolved from a string afterwards. On Windows the root's own handle is what
    holds, since it blocks renaming ``members`` and everything above it.

    The leaf test is kept as well, and it is not a second guess at the directory: it
    covers a single file swapped for a link inside a directory that is genuinely this
    member's, where the worst case is removing a link instead of the file it names.

    Every name is attempted even after one refuses, so a single stuck file does not
    hide the rest; the refusal is carried to the answer rather than to an exception,
    because the caller needs a verdict it can act on and not a second failure mode.

    The legacy path is AGENT-WRITABLE -- that is this module's own premise for
    keeping the completion marker in the fenced log root instead -- and the fold
    runs inside ``ensure`` under the per-slug lock, which the roster request path
    calls. So the party the marker defends against also chooses what KIND of
    thing sits at this path, and a plain ``open`` trusts that choice twice:

    * a FIFO blocks the open until a writer appears, which no writer ever has to
      be. That stalls the fold, the lock, and the request behind it, and it
      outlives a restart: the hang happens BEFORE the marker can be written, so
      the FIFO survives and the marker never lands.
    * a symlink redirects the read somewhere the member directory does not own.

    ``platform_compat.open_file_no_reparse`` is that open, named: ``O_NONBLOCK``
    makes the FIFO open return at once instead of waiting, and the ``fstat`` then
    refuses it for what it is, while the reparse-point refusal is settled in the
    SAME operation that opens -- on POSIX by ``O_NOFOLLOW``, and on Windows by
    ``FILE_FLAG_OPEN_REPARSE_POINT``, because Windows has no ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and a
    feature-detected ``getattr(os, "O_NOFOLLOW", 0)`` is therefore 0 there. The
    regular-file check does NOT cover that case: a link whose target is a regular
    file passes ``S_ISREG`` while the read has already been redirected. On a
    regular file ``O_NONBLOCK`` changes nothing about the reads.

    ``None`` means ONLY "this file is not something to migrate from" -- it does not
    exist, or it is not a regular file. A genuine I/O FAILURE is raised instead of

        same value at more cost, and that is the whole posture of a savepoint.

        TWO conditions decide that, not one. The identity block covers what is fixed
        once a fold is done and is compared by equality. The prefix digest covers what
        equality cannot reach: that the bytes the state was folded from are still the

        revisits the region below its watermark. Without the digest those two reads

        whatever a dead run got through stays done, and whatever it did not is picked
        up by a later call.

        ONE completed pass per process settles the member, and every call after it
        returns here -- without the lease, which is the point. ``ensure`` is called
        once per member on every roster read and once per message, and by then every
        item skips itself, so a call that cannot do any work would still be spending
        a cross-process lease acquire and a set of legacy path reads to find that
        out. The memo is per PROCESS and deliberately not a file: a run that dies
        mid-fold leaves no memo behind, so the next process folds the member again.

        Nothing is recorded unless the pass read every legacy source to its END. A
        refused lease, an exception out of the fold, and a read that came back short
        of what the file holds all leave the memo unwritten, and the member is folded
        again on a later call. The last of those is the one worth naming: a file over
        the byte budget, and a read an ``OSError`` interrupted, RETURN rather than
        raise, so "the pass did not throw" is not the question -- which is why the
        fold answers it instead.

        A completion marker event would answer the same question in one check, and
        is deliberately not used: it would sit in every member's log forever and
        shift the seq of every event after it -- an on-disk cost paid by every
        member, for a concern that ends with the first successful pass.

        Held under the unit's CROSS-PROCESS lease for its whole length, which the
        per-append lease cannot supply. The append path takes and releases the lease
        inside each append, so between two of them another process is free to run
        its own fold: both snapshot a log with no activity records, both find every
        legacy row unmatched, and both append it. Retirement then makes the
        duplication permanent, and nothing reports it. This log has two ordinary
        writers -- the gateway and ``kirocrew-core`` -- so two folds of one member
        during an upgrade is routine, not exotic.

        A refusal means another process is already folding this member. Nothing is
        done, and nothing is retired either, so the source is re-read on the next

        the store's absence has been overtaken and there is a unit for the caller to
        aim ``remove_unit`` at, which is a different instruction from "the source is
        still there because nothing could be held".

        The branch for a unit the store did not find. There is nothing there to hold
        a lease in, and the race that needs holding is precisely a peer creating that
        unit: its fresh ``ensure`` writes a header and then folds this source, so a
        cleanup with no lease can lose to it and leave the rows in a unit nobody
        removes. The lease is a file BESIDE the unit's segments, so the directory is
        created to carry it, the lease is taken, and the directory goes again after.

        Serializing against the fold is what the lease buys: the fold takes this same
        lease before reading, and a non-sole acquire from another PROCESS is refused
        rather than shared, so the peer writes nothing while this runs.

        **A peer that got there FIRST is caught by re-deciding the absence inside the
        hold, not by the store's decision.** The store answered ``absent`` from an
        ``is_dir`` taken with no lease held, so "the store would have found a unit"
        is only true of a unit that existed at that moment: a peer can create one,
        fold this source into it and release entirely inside the window that ends
        when the acquire here returns. A segment present under the hold is what proves
        it, since the directory this method creates to carry the lease holds none.
        Removing the source then would be the worst of the three outcomes -- the fold
        survives in a unit for a member the roster does not have, and no sweep
        collects it -- so that case answers :data:`_CLEAN_RACED` with the source, the
        lease and the directory all untouched, and the caller re-runs the one spelling
        of deletion against the unit that now exists.

        The created directory is owner-only and holds no segment, so it is not a unit
        to any reader: :func:`store.unit_ids` proves identity from a segment header
        and skips a directory that has none, which is why this cannot make a deleted
        member list again. It is removed anyway, so nothing is left to explain.

        A lease that cannot be had answers false with the source untouched, the same
        direction every other decision in this teardown takes -- and it leaves the
        lease file and the directory alone as well, because a refusal means a peer

        """Append a closer only while the projection still shows what it closes.

        A closer is decided from a SNAPSHOT and written afterwards, and between those
        two the state it describes can legitimately change: the startup reconcile runs
        as a background task concurrent with the gateway going live, so a slot it read
        as durably open can be reopened, or a patrol re-armed, by a live writer before
        the closer lands. The log is append-only with no compaction, so a closer that
        lands after a live open is a permanent regression of the projection -- and not
        a self-correcting one, because a later restart's reconcile reads the state as
        closed and has no reason to reopen it.

        ``still_applies`` is therefore re-asked HERE, under the lock that writes, and
        is handed the CURRENT projection values rather than the caller's snapshot.
        ``_get_log`` has already folded anything a concurrent writer committed, so
        those values include the live change the caller could not have seen. Returns
        ``None`` when the closer does not apply, which is a normal outcome and not
        a failure: it means the state closed itself while the reconcile was deciding.

        It is handed ``observed`` -- the values the caller DECIDED on -- as a second
        argument, because the current state alone cannot answer the question. The
        state is not the episode: a patrol that stopped and was RE-ARMED in this
        window reads ``armed`` exactly like the original episode the caller meant to
        close, so a predicate that tests only the current state stamps the NEW
        episode with the OLD one's closer, and the fresh patrol then reads as
        stopped. Comparing against ``observed`` is what tells those two apart.

        Note what is deliberately NOT done: refusing whenever the projection sequence
        advanced. ``snapshot`` reports one ``asOfSeq`` for the whole slug -- the max
        across every projection cell -- and ``_get_log`` folds all pending commits
        first, so ANY unrelated event on the member advances it and a closer gated on
        it would essentially never fire. The comparison belongs on the projection
        block the closer concerns, which is why the predicate makes it and not this
        method.

        This exists rather than a predicate on :meth:`append` because the predicate
        must not re-enter the service to read state -- ``snapshot`` takes this same
        non-reentrant lock, so a caller that reached for it would deadlock.

        The predicate is asked against a state no foreign commit can have moved,
        and that guarantee comes from the store rather than from the per-slug lock
        above. The per-slug lock orders this process's writers, and for them it is
        enough: a concurrent in-process append queues behind this hold and lands
        after, which is the winning order. It says nothing about another PROCESS,
        and the member log has more than one writer -- an entry another process
        commits between our fold and our write lands FIRST, and a last-wins
        projection then takes ours as the newer word for a state that had already
        moved.

        What the store is given is the seq this fold reached, and what runs inside
        its hold is ONE comparison against the tail. The fold itself parses the log,
        and a parse under a cross-process lock is a hold nothing bounds -- a peer
        append gives up after a bounded wait and its event is then lost for good, so
        the expensive half stays outside, and passing a seq rather than a callback is
        what keeps it there. A foreign commit makes the tail exceed what we folded,
        the append declines without writing, and the loop folds that entry and asks
        the predicate again. Seqs only increase, so the comparison cannot be fooled
        by a tail that moved and came back.

    # ---- removal ----------------------------------------------------------
    def remove_unit(self, slug: str, *, still_unclaimed: Callable[[], bool]) -> str:
        """Remove *slug*'s crew log and forget it here. One of the ``REMOVE_*`` statuses.

        The member half of the door ``sessions._remove_session_crew_log`` is for
        sessions: a caller outside this package says WHICH member's history has no
        owner left, and this owns the two steps that knowledge implies -- the
        store's removal, and dropping what this service caches for that slug. A
        handler reaching into the store itself would do the first and forget the
        second, and a cached ``MemberLog`` that outlives its files answers reads
        for a member whose history is gone.

        *still_unclaimed* is the caller's reason, re-asked under the removal's own
        lease hold: the store calls it as the ``guard`` it requires. It takes no
        arguments because this reason is not a property of the file -- whether a
        member is still in the roster is a property of the config -- so re-reading
        the log here would answer a question nobody asked. Re-asking it at all is
        what the session sweep's guard is for: the caller decided outside the
        hold, and a same-name member committed in that window owns this very unit,
        because the unit is keyed by the slug and a recreated namesake derives the
        same one. The predicate answering false is an ordinary outcome, not a
        failure: nothing is removed and nothing is written.

        Called under the per-slug lock, so an append through this service is
        serialized against it rather than racing the unlink. The lock ENTRY is
        kept afterwards while the log and name caches are dropped: a later caller
        that found no entry would build a second lock for the same slug, and two
        threads holding different locks for one slug is worse than a dict entry
        for a member that is gone. Nothing else is dropped, because nothing else
        survives the removal as an answer -- the folded cells for this slug stay
        in the registry, and are unreachable through every read here, each of
        which returns empty once ``_get_log`` finds no file.

        **The legacy activity source goes with the unit, INSIDE the store's own lease
        hold and BEFORE the unit itself, and that is what makes the removal mean
        anything.** Those rows are the member's own pre-log history, they live outside
        the unit under ``members/<slug>/``, and the marker saying they were already
        folded lives INSIDE it -- so a removal that took only the unit would leave the
        history on disk AND leave the next fresh ``ensure`` free to fold it into a new
        log, in this process or any other writer's. Taking it after the removal
        RETURNED would leave the same fold reachable in the window between the lease's
        release and the unlink, so it is handed to ``remove_unit`` as its ``in_hold``
        action instead.

        The order inside that hold is the source first, and it is not arbitrary: the
        marker gating the fold is part of the unit, so a unit destroyed while the
        source survives has ARMED the fold rather than half-finished it. So the
        cleanup answers whether the source is really gone, and the store keeps
        everything on a false answer -- the unit, its marker, and the source under it
        -- and reports ``failed``. Taken, a later append can recreate at most an empty
        header, which carries nothing.

        **A unit the store does not find leaves that source behind too, so the
        cleanup runs for an absent unit as well, and there it re-asks the roster
        itself.** A member whose log was never written, or whose fold has not run, has
        its history ONLY in that source, and skipping it there would leave the delete
        having removed nothing at all. The store calls the predicate as its guard only
        when there is a unit to hold, so for an absent one there is no answer to
        inherit and this asks again; the question raising rather than answering keeps
        the source, the same direction every other decision here takes. That branch
        takes the unit's lease ITSELF rather than running bare, because the race it
        has to win is a peer creating the very unit the store just failed to find and
        folding this source into it. **And it re-decides the absence under that hold
        rather than trusting the one it inherited**: the store's ``is_dir`` ran with no
        lease, so a peer can create, fold and release entirely inside the window that
        ends at the acquire. A unit found there means the absence is stale, nothing is
        removed, and this method calls ``remove_unit`` a second time -- now against a
        unit that exists, so the fold and the source go inside one hold of its own and
        the status returned describes THAT removal rather than the absence that is no
        longer true.

        Only PROVEN absence reaches it. A unit whose own name is a link answers
        ``linked``, not ``absent``, and that distinction is load-bearing here rather
        than tidy: this branch re-derives the unit path, which RESOLVES, so acting on a
        link as absence would take the lease of whatever it points at -- very likely a
        live member's unit -- and unlink that unit's lease file inside its own hold. A
        link is left entirely alone, for a person to remove.

        **The caches go whenever the store removed anything, which includes a partial
        removal.** A ``failed`` status can mean the contents partly went, and a reader
        holding this slug's cached handle would then serve a projection folded from
        history that is gone. Dropping a cache entry costs a reopen and nothing else,
        so it is done on both ``removed`` and ``failed``; only ``owned`` -- where
        nothing was touched, because a namesake owns the slug again -- keeps them.
