"""Contribution protocol: the gateway side of an out-of-process contributor.

Implements ``docs/system-specs/modules/contribution-protocol.md``. Three pieces
live here, and the HTTP handlers, the WebSocket hub and app teardown are thin
callers of them:

``UnitRegistry``
    Which unit kinds have a log. A kind is a REGISTRATION -- ``{kind, id_field,
    frame, service}`` -- so adding a second kind is one ``register_unit`` call
    rather than a rewrite of the routes. Today: ``member``.

``ExternalProjectionStore``
    One row per ``(kind, id, key)`` published from outside, with higher-seq-wins
    and a ``stateVersion`` override, plus an optional render schema per key.
    Durable, because a contributor publishes at its own cadence: an in-memory
    table would drop every contributed card on a gateway restart and leave the
    Members page blank until the contributor happened to re-fold.

``EventBudget``
    Per app, per unit, per UTC day. Deliberately process memory: the budget
    bounds one gateway's exposure to a runaway contributor, and a restart is
    already the loudest possible signal that the process is not the one that
    counted. Persisting it would buy a stricter bound on a resource (log bytes)
    that the 64 KiB per-event cap already bounds.

Nothing here executes contributor code. A contributor reads events, folds in its
own process, and publishes whole values; the gateway stays the only writer of
every log.

#: Serialized size cap for one event's ``data`` (contract §4).
MAX_EVENT_DATA_BYTES = 64 * 1024

#: Serialized size cap for one published projection ``value``. Not in the
#: contract's §5 prose, but a projection is a WHOLE value pushed to every
#: dashboard socket, so leaving it unbounded would let a contributor make the
#: Members page unloadable. Ten times the event cap: a folded view legitimately
#: summarises many events.
MAX_PROJECTION_VALUE_BYTES = 640 * 1024

#: Longest a SINGLE string anywhere inside a projection ``value`` OR an event
#: ``data`` payload may be, in characters. The whole-value byte cap is NOT enough
#: on its own: every string in a published value (and every string in an event's
#: ``data``, served to a catch-up reader and pushed as a live frame) is run through
#: the exfiltration-URL + credential redaction chain before it crosses to a
#: dashboard, and that chain is QUADRATIC in one string's length
#: (``_contains_bare_secret`` slides a 40-char window across every base64-alphabet
#: run; measured ~1.7s at 24 KB, ~11.7s at 63 KB, minutes at the 640 KiB
#: whole-value cap). That scan runs on the gateway event loop inside
#: ``_push_projection`` and inside the ``events`` catch-up read, so a granted app
#: publishing (or appending) one large string stalls chat and the heartbeat until
#: the hard-exit watchdog (``LOOP_STALL_EXIT_AFTER_DEFAULT = 25``s) terminates the
#: gateway (GPT 6.1 / Opus 5.5, residual/crash-data-loss-corruption). Offloading
#: the GIL-holding regex to a thread does NOT fix it: the scan holds the GIL, so
#: it starves the loop from the worker thread just the same.
#:
#: Opus 5.5: the bound must sit FAR below 64 KiB because the cost is quadratic --
#: at 64 KiB a handful of such strings on one ``?limit=500`` page already exceed
#: the 25s watchdog. Set to 8 KiB: the measured per-string redaction cost there is
#: well under 0.1s, so even a full 500-event page of max-length strings stays far
#: under the watchdog, and the per-page budget below is the backstop. The bound is
#: on the string's LENGTH, checked before persistence, so the oversized input
#: never reaches the scan at all -- the same shape as ``_MAX_RAW_SCHEMA_FIELD_CHARS``
#: and ``MAX_SCANNABLE_COMMAND_CHARS``, which bound the WORK a quadratic gate may be
#: handed for the same watchdog. A whole value/payload made of many 8 KiB-bounded
#: strings is still allowed up to its byte cap. Over it is refused outright, not
#: truncated: a string that long is never a real folded view or event field, and
#: refusing it keeps the quadratic scan off oversized input instead of paying it
#: once to learn the string was junk.
MAX_PROJECTION_VALUE_STRING_CHARS = 8 * 1024

#: Alias for the event-``data`` path: the same per-string bound, named at the
#: event surface so a future change to one cannot silently diverge from the other.
MAX_EVENT_DATA_STRING_CHARS = MAX_PROJECTION_VALUE_STRING_CHARS

#: Ceiling on the TOTAL redacted string length one catch-up page (``events?limit=``)
#: may hand the egress redaction chain. The per-string bound keeps any ONE string
#: cheap, but a full page of them still sums; this caps the whole page's redaction
#: work so 500 events cannot add up past the loop-stall watchdog even in the worst
#: case. Generous relative to the per-string bound (a real folded log page is far
#: smaller), and a page that would exceed it is served in smaller slices by the
#: reader rather than redacted whole on the loop. 2 MiB of redactable text is a
#: fraction of a second of scan at the 8 KiB per-string bound.
MAX_CATCHUP_PAGE_REDACT_CHARS = 2 * 1024 * 1024

#: Default per-app, per-unit, per-day event budget (contract §4).
DEFAULT_EVENT_BUDGET_PER_DAY = 10_000

#: Hard cap on how many distinct ``(app, kind, id, day)`` keys the EventBudget map
#: retains. The opportunistic cleanup only drops keys from a PAST day, so an app
#: charging against more than this many distinct units within a SINGLE day would
#: otherwise grow the map without bound (every key is current-day, so nothing is
#: dropped). At the cap the map reclaims only what is genuinely spent -- past-day
#: keys first, then zero-charge entries a ``release`` left behind -- and if it is
#: STILL full with nothing but live in-day counters it REFUSES the new key
#: (``quota_exceeded``) rather than evict one: a quota map's job is to remember,
#: and evicting a live counter would reset that unit's count to zero and let it
#: accept another full day past its limit. The refused contributor's honest
#: retries succeed once a key ages out. Bounds the map without forgetting a live
#: quota.
_MAX_EVENT_BUDGET_KEYS = 8192

#: How many projection keys ONE app may retain for one unit. The per-value size
#: cap above bounds each row and nothing bounds their number, so a contributor
#: holding a wildcard ``<app>/*`` grant can publish a new unique key forever and
#: every one of them is retained in memory and rewritten to disk. Each key is a
#: card in the member drawer, so this is far past any honest fold and still
#: leaves the store bounded.
MAX_PROJECTION_KEYS_PER_APP_UNIT = 64

#: Longest a single projection KEY may be. The cap above bounds how MANY keys are
#: retained and ``MAX_PROJECTION_VALUE_BYTES`` bounds each value, but the key is
#: retained as well -- in the in-memory row map and in every durable rewrite of it
#: -- and nothing measured it. A key is an ``<app>/<name>`` identifier a person
#: reads on a card, so this is generous for every legitimate one.
MAX_PROJECTION_KEY_CHARS = 128

#: Ceiling on a RAW schema field (the title, each path selector) checked BEFORE
#: the redact scan runs. An oversized field admitted under the HTTP body cap would
#: otherwise run the exfiltration-URL + credential chain over megabytes on the
#: serving loop and stall the watchdog into a hard exit. Generous next to the
#: 120-char post-redact cut: it bounds the WORK done per field, not the field's
#: rendered shape.
_MAX_RAW_SCHEMA_FIELD_CHARS = 4096

#: Largest the on-disk projection file for one unit may be. Enforced on BOTH
#: sides: the writer refuses a payload over it, and the loader refuses to read a
#: file over it. Derived rather than picked, and the multiplier is the number of
#: distinct contributing APPS one unit is budgeted for -- the per-app key ceiling
#: bounds each app at keys-per-app-unit times value-bytes, so eight maximally
#: loaded apps reach this number and JSON framing comes out of the same budget.
#: A ninth app, or eight full ones plus framing, is refused at the write door
#: rather than stored as a file no later load will accept. The file is written by
#: this store, but it lives in the data home where it can be hand-edited, so the
#: loader may not assume its size either.
MAX_PROJECTION_STORE_BYTES = 8 * MAX_PROJECTION_KEYS_PER_APP_UNIT * MAX_PROJECTION_VALUE_BYTES

#: Largest value a publish may carry in ``seq`` or ``stateVersion``. Both are
#: RETAINED in the row, both order it, and both are pushed to every dashboard,
#: where they are compared as JavaScript numbers. Above ``2**53 - 1`` those
#: comparisons stop being exact, so a value past that point does two things at
#: once: it wins against every later publish for the life of the row, and it
#: reaches a client that cannot order it exactly. An honest ``seq`` is a
#: contributor's own fold position and an honest ``stateVersion`` is a generation
#: counter, so this ceiling is astronomically past either while still sitting
#: thirteen doublings below the exact-integer limit. It bounds the two fields
#: together because the ground is the same for both; a per-unit ceiling is NOT
#: that ground -- a contributed row's seq belongs to its app, not to this log.
MAX_PROJECTION_ORDERING_VALUE = 2**40

#: Maximum nesting depth of an event ``data`` or a projection ``value``.
#:
#: Re-exported from the vocabulary module, which is where the redaction pass
#: reads the same number from: this door and that pass must agree, or a payload
#: accepted here becomes a ``RecursionError`` at the network boundary.
MAX_VALUE_DEPTH = types.MAX_VALUE_DEPTH

#: Render kinds a published schema may name (contract §7).
SCHEMA_KINDS = frozenset({"badge", "text", "list", "table", "keyvalue"})

#: The HTTP status each contract §9 error code answers with. ONE table, so a
#: raise site names only a code and the wire status is decided here -- which is
#: also what lets the repo's error-code contract test verify statically that
#: every error response carries a ``code`` (it cannot follow a computed status).

        a live gateway, and :meth:`_flush` rewrites the unit from whatever snapshot
        the flushing process holds -- so a snapshot taken before the other side's

    redaction chain is quadratic in a single string's length and runs on the

    turning a coded 400 into a 500. Only JSON containers are descended, which is
    all a value that reached here can hold. Dict keys are checked too: a key is an
