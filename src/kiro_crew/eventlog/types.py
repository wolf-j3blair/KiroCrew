"""Event vocabulary for the per-member append-only log.

One log per member, header first, then envelopes. Durable facts only: live
presence (a slot's ``running`` flag, approval prompts) never enters the log and
keeps riding the ``slots`` WebSocket frame.

Envelope (one JSON object per line after the header)::

    {"type": "<event type>", "seq": <int>, "time": <epoch ms>, "data": {...}}

``seq`` is the crew log's own entry number, so the header is 0 and the first
event is 1. The crew log store assigns it off the file tail under its own lock;
a damaged line inside the committed region costs a reader that line and nothing
else, so a gap in the numbers is not a contiguity failure.
