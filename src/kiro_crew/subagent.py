    "+N more" only when there is a remainder to report).

    Three surfaces render this roster -- an unknown-agent refusal, the spawn
    tools' parameter descriptions, and ``spawn_list``'s output -- and all three
    come through the pipeline below rather than re-implementing it. Duplicated

    omit it:

    * **Grammar.** Every name must match the registered-agent grammar
      (``is_registered_agent_name``: the slot grammar or a published dotted
      template) before it is rendered. This is the load-bearing filter, not a tidiness check: an agent
      spec's ``name`` field is taken verbatim by
      ``agent_discovery._global_agent_info`` with no validation, so a spec can
      declare a name containing a newline plus instruction-shaped text -- which
      is pure ASCII, so an ``isascii`` check passes it -- and it would ride this
      string into a model's context. ``SPAWN_RUN_SCHEMA`` gates the ``agent``
      parameter on the same grammar, so a name that fails it could never have
      been dispatched anyway: offering it would advertise an unusable name.
    * **Redaction.** A grammar-valid name can still be credential-shaped (an
      AWS access key is pure alphanumerics), so each name goes through the
      canonical context-aware shim rather than being trusted.
    * **Bound.** Every rendered roster that reaches always-on context is capped,
      and the remainder is returned as a count instead of being silently lost.

    Order is the CALLER's: this returns names in the order it received them, so
    each surface keeps the presentation its own copy promises. *exclude* defaults
    to the reserved pair (reached by omitting ``agent``, never by naming one);
    ``spawn_list`` passes an empty set on purpose, because the two bounded

    Consequence, stated plainly: a project agent is accepted only once that

    ``.md``) is read only when no spec declares the name. Two specs declaring
    the same name are both kept -- the target must then satisfy each, which is
    tightest-wins rather than a guess at which one kiro-cli loaded.

    ``()`` when *parent_template* is empty, names no spec, or its spec omits the
    key: each of those is "no declaration to honour", the unchanged case.

    ``None`` means the answer is UNKNOWN and the caller must refuse: the
    directory exists but cannot be scanned (probed before the snapshot read,
    which folds a walk failure into "no specs"), or no readable spec declares
    the name while some spec file in the directory could not be read under the
    hardened reader (invalid JSON, oversized, a broken link, a symlink to a
    sensitive target). kiro-cli resolves a name by its DECLARED ``name`` first,
    under any filename, so the parent's declaration may be inside exactly the
    file that did not parse; the reader folds it into "no spec", and a
    restrictive declaration inside it would otherwise fail OPEN. A parent whose
    declaration IS readable is never refused by an unrelated broken file. The
    cost is that a parent with no user-level spec at all (a project-scope or
    edition agent) is refused too while any spec file in the directory is
    unreadable; the refusal names the file, and repairing or removing it
    restores admission. AppleDouble ``._`` sidecars, which the reader rejects by
    design, do not count.

    and mtime only, so an mtime-preserving rewrite of a parent's spec
    (``cp -p``, ``rsync -t``) would serve its previous, permissive allowlist for
    ever; ``cached_agent_specs`` serves EMPTY rows on a cold cache, and an empty
    read here would admit a spawn the declaration forbids. It is a blocking
    read, so the event-loop entry points call it through ``asyncio.to_thread``
    (see :func:`parent_spawn_policy`) rather than from the gate. A parent living
    only in a project's ``.kiro/agents`` is not resolved here (its declaration

    would evict its own earliest ids while its reports were still being spawned -- and
    those reports then walk through the gate and rebuild the conversation the teardown
    took down. An age rule cannot do that: the TTL is chosen to exceed every window in

    Age is also why the lifetime is not tied to the run's ``_agents`` record. That record
    is popped while a run is still tearing down (a dashboard "clear completed" does it),
    so discarding on the pop would disarm the gate while the run can still announce --

        this surface goes through here (``test_eval_subagent_deny_notice`` walks
        ``subagent_manager/run.py`` to keep that true), so a path added later
        cannot deny by omission.

        *cause* is REQUIRED and says whether the HOST refused this call. A
        rejected permission reaches the model as kiro-cli's fixed "User denied
        tool execution"; for a host deny that is a refusal that never happened,
        and the model abandons or routes around a call nobody objected to. So a
        host cause (``DENY_CAUSE_POLICY`` for a hook or spec-gate verdict on the
        call itself, ``DENY_CAUSE_SURFACE_POLICY`` for the unattended run
        refusing a call nothing positively authorizes) steers the in-band notice
        through ``llm_helpers._steer_host_deny`` BEFORE the reject -- while the
        permission request is still unanswered the turn is provably in flight,
        which is what gets the notice queued rather than dropped (see
        ``kiro_crew.deny_notice``). ``None`` is the explicit verdict that this is
        NOT a host deny and must stay bare: an interactive approver said no
        (kiro-cli's wording is then the truth, and "this was NOT a user action"
        would be a lie), or the run is bailing on a turn / escalation limit and
        there is no continuing turn for a notice to correct. A caller has to
        write one or the other; there is no default to inherit the wrong answer
        from. *reason* is the host's own wording for the notice; the metric and
        the SEL row keep their closed-enum ``error``.

        The audit lands FIRST, before the steer and the reject, as on every other
        deny surface: the steer is one more bounded await on the ACP pipe, and a
        backend that stops reading stdin cancels this coroutine at the turn
        deadline with the decision acted on and never audited if the row came

        The width carries the uniqueness on its own, with nothing to remember and

        one host collided about once in 2,100 times, and the collision did not

        handed the id and the accept then failed on the duplicate primary key,

        the one resource every start in startup contends for: ``session/new``
        runs under ``G`` permits, so at most ``G`` starts make progress at any
        moment and every other admitted start is a spawned process (dedicated
        path) or a claimed slot holding nothing but a place in the gate's
        queue. Time spent in that queue is not charged to the startup deadline
        (the clock pauses at queue entry and resumes at acquisition --
        ``_gate_wait_mark`` / ``_gate_exit_reset``), so the queue's length is
        not what reaps a healthy start; what the bound decides is how much of
        the running cap may sit in startup contending for ``G`` permits at
        once. ``2G`` is the smallest value that never idles the gate -- one
        round holding permits and one round already admitted to take them the
        moment they free -- and admitting more buys no starts, since the gate
        serves ``G`` per round however many are queued: it only lengthens the
        queue and grows the population of admitted-but-idle starts. A
        cap-derived term (``max(..., ceil(cap / 4))``, say) would do exactly
        that: 16 in startup at a cap of 64 against a 2-permit gate is seven
        rounds queued for two permits. The population the bound is checked
        against (:meth:`_in_startup`) is the agents actually starting, plus
        reservations not yet registered (:meth:`_startup_population`). Agents
        parked at the spawn-approval prompt are NOT in it -- they start nothing
        and must not block unrelated spawns -- and are instead metered through
        the pump when their prompt resolves (:meth:`_admit_released_start`), so
        "at most ``2G`` in startup" holds even when a bulk trust/yolo grant
        releases them all at once.

        There is deliberately NO config key for this value. ``2G`` is both the
        floor and the ceiling of the useful range: fewer than ``2G`` idles the
        gate between rounds (no next round already admitted when the current
        one releases), and more than ``2G`` buys no starts -- the gate serves
        ``G`` per round however many are queued behind it -- only a longer
        queue of idle admitted starts. A knob could therefore only make the
        system worse, and the operator's real lever on this bound already
        exists: ``agent.session_start_concurrency`` sizes the gate, and the
        bound tracks it.
