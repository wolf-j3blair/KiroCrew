"""Auto-nudge service — reactive same-session self-prompting loop.

Each active loop is bound to a dashboard chat slot. When the slot's turn
completes (``HOOK_EVENT_STOP``), we arm a timer toward the loop's persistent
deadline (``next_due_ts``). If the deadline elapses with no new user input,
we inject the configured nudge message as the next turn into the same slot.

The countdown is DEADLINE-PRESERVING: a user message cancels the pending fire
(a nudge must never race a human turn) but does not push the deadline back —
when the user's turn ends, the timer resumes toward the same ``next_due_ts``,
firing shortly after the turn if the deadline already passed. Only the loop's
own delivered cycles start a fresh full interval (measured from the nudge
turn's end). Without this, a session chatted in more often than ``idle_secs``
starves its loop forever: every message restarted the full interval, so a
30-minute babysit loop in an active conversation never fired at all.

State is persisted to ``~/.kiro/crew/autonudge.json`` (fcntl-locked, atomic
write). On gateway restart, active loops are reloaded and timers re-armed.

The browser observes the loop through the normal chat stream path — nudges
appear as user-style messages tagged ``[auto-nudge cycle N]`` so they are
visually distinct from human input.

Feature-flagged via env ``KIROCREW_AUTONUDGE`` (on by default; set to ``0`` to disable).

The service's responsibilities live in :mod:`kiro_crew.autonudge_service`, one owner
per module: the loop record and its vocabulary, monitor inference, the durable store,
the maintenance transaction, the timer lifecycle, the probe gate, the wake judge's
tick, the fire cycle, the loop transactions and the structured-monitor transitions.
:class:`AutoNudgeService` is defined here and composes them. It keeps the live loop
registry and the coordination state those owners share, its lifecycle and singleton,
the observer hook, the persistence entry points, and the loader: ``_load`` vets and
scrubs every stored row at the trust boundary, so it stays with the scrub helpers
every other entrance uses too. The owners' methods are bound on the class by name,
in one table at the end of its body.

This module is also the subsystem's import and patch surface: every name it defined
before those owners moved out still resolves here as the same object its owner holds,
and so does every public name it imported from the rest of the package and every
other import callers and tests read off it. The names moved code reads through this
module on each call -- so a patch here reaches it -- are
``_OVERDUE_REARM_SECS``, ``_RECONCILE_INTERVAL_SECS``, ``replace_with_retry``,
``fsync_dir``, ``scrubbed_judge_spec``, ``_INSTANCE``, ``_MAINTENANCE_LOCKS`` and
``_MUTATION_LOCK_OWNERS``. Every other name the owners read is their own global, which
a patch here does not reach.

    """Re-home a persisted ``stop_sentinel_path`` onto the CURRENT data home.

    The kill-switch path is resolved once at arm time (``resolve_stop_sentinel``,
    which builds it under ``workspace_dir_for(...)`` → normally
    ``config_dir()/workspace``) and then persisted verbatim in the loop store.
    That store survives the one-time ``~/.kirocrew`` → ``~/.kiro/crew`` data-home
    migration (``config/paths.py``) and is re-armed on the next ``start()``, so a
    loop armed BEFORE the move comes back pointing at a directory that no longer
    exists. ``_timer`` only ever tests ``Path(stop_sentinel_path).exists()``, so
    such a loop has a DEAD kill switch: a sentinel written at the freshly
    resolved (current-home) path is never seen, and the only remaining stops are
    ``max_cycles`` and an explicit remove.

    Three transformations, in order:

    1. **Pass through a path already under the CURRENT home.** Checked FIRST,
       because ``KIROCREW_HOME`` may legally point *inside* the legacy root
       (e.g. ``~/.kirocrew/dev``). Such a path is lexically under
       ``~/.kirocrew`` yet already live and correct; re-homing it would produce
       ``~/.kirocrew/dev/dev/workspace/…``, persist that, and — since the
       rewrite is not idempotent — append another segment every boot, disabling
       a WORKING kill switch with the very code meant to repair dead ones.
    2. **Re-home a STRANDED legacy-rooted path.** A path under ``~/.kirocrew``
       is rewritten onto the resolved current home. The migration relocated the
       whole tree wholesale, so the tail after the home prefix is still correct.
       Gated on the sentinel's directory no longer existing: an absolute
       ``workspaces.<name>.dir`` may legitimately live inside that tree (and the
       legacy root can survive as debris), and rewriting a live path would move
       a working kill switch outside its configured workspace and persist that.
       Skipped when the current home IS the legacy home (``KIROCREW_HOME``
       pointing there, or the migration's fall-back-to-legacy path) — there the
       persisted path is already live. Both sides are normalized LEXICALLY
       (``os.path.normpath``, no filesystem access) before the containment
       test, so an unnormalized value like ``~/.kirocrew/../workspace/STOP``
       is not mistaken for a legacy-contained path and rewritten elsewhere.
    3. **Re-apply the arm-time sensitivity refusal.** ``authorize_and_add_nudge``
       refuses a sensitive ``stop_sentinel_path`` at arm time, but the denylist
       can widen between releases and the persisted value outlives the original
       check. A path that is sensitive NOW is dropped to ``""`` (no sentinel)
       rather than kept, so the service never stats an attacker- or
       credential-adjacent location on a timer. The check itself FAILS CLOSED:
       if ``is_sensitive_path`` raises, the path is dropped rather than trusted,
       because an unvalidated path is exactly what this step exists to reject.

    Returns the (possibly rewritten) path, or ``""`` to mean "no sentinel".
    Non-``str`` input (a malformed store where ``stop_sentinel_path`` is a
    number or list) yields ``""`` instead of raising — this runs inside
    ``_load()`` during ``start()``, so an exception here would abort gateway
    startup entirely.

    Deliberately does NOT require the path to live under the data home: an
    absolute ``workspaces.<name>.dir`` is a legitimate configuration, and
    clearing those would break working kill switches.

    BLOCKING: performs no filesystem I/O itself, but ``is_sensitive_path``
    resolves realpaths, which can block on an unavailable network mount.
    ``start()`` therefore runs the whole load+repair phase in an executor.

        ``self._loops`` concurrently with a mutation would race. The returned
        payload is immutable-by-convention and safe to hand to an executor.
        Loops are built from ``self._loops`` alone, so a row ``_load`` declined is
        absent from ``loops``. An unusable addressing field is NOT dropped: it is held
        in the ``autonudge.quarantine.json`` sidecar, which this payload does not carry
        and this write does not touch, so the entry the operator was warned about is
        still there to repair. It is kept out of ``loops`` because addressing fields are
        served unscrubbed. A row that could not be PARSED is carried here verbatim from
        ``self._store.unparsed_rows``: it arms nothing, but any cause that flags the store dirty would
        otherwise make this write delete a neighbour nobody chose to remove.

        A whole-store refusal covers three causes, and ``_write_state`` honours all of
        them by refusing rather than persisting a payload that is empty because nothing
        could be vetted: a credential policy this host declares but cannot compose, a
        ``loops`` value that is present but not a list, and a quarantine sidecar that
        could not be read. An unusable addressing field is quarantined per row instead,
        so it is never refused wholesale.

        DELIBERATE, and the alternative named: held rows could instead be re-emitted into
        this payload's own ``loops`` and never armed, which would delete the sidecar and its
        whole ordering apparatus -- and with it the cross-process race its lock now covers.
        Not taken here because a build PREDATING the ``quarantined`` key (see
        ``_QUARANTINE_FILE``) reads this payload back with no held-row concept, so an
        embedded row is an ordinary loop to it and it ARMS the addressing field this
        quarantine refuses. Serving is NOT the reason: a held row is absent from ``_loops``,
        so no client frame can carry it, exactly as ``self._store.unparsed_rows`` rides this list
        unserved. Revisiting it means accepting that downgrade-arming risk.

        """Whether *loop*'s monitor is a work-ledger watch THIS gateway may arm.

        A predicate rather than an inline comparison because the answer decides a
        STARTUP behaviour (resume now, not at the deadline) and the reason is specific to
        this kind: its news arrives by an in-process push that a restart loses, where
        every other kind's arrives by the probe's own poll.

        The VERSION is part of the question, not a separate guard, and leaving it out was
        a reachable hole rather than a theoretical one. ``_arm_from_deadline`` refuses a
        monitor record whose ``version`` this gateway does not implement, because such a
        record belongs to a newer gateway and running the loop would deliver an unattended
        turn under a policy nothing here can interpret. A work-ledger watch is a
        ``gate=True`` prompt loop, so ``is_structured_monitor_loop`` is False and ``_load``
        leaves such a row ACTIVE -- exactly the shape a zero-delay arm here would have
        bypassed that refusal for. Answering False sends the row to
        ``_arm_from_deadline``, which refuses it and logs why, so the refusal lives in one
        place rather than being restated here.

        The kind is compared against ``probes.WORK_LEDGER``, read off the module-level
        ``probes`` binding this facade already re-exports.
