# ── cron job health ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# The dashboard already surfaces a failing job per-row (an `err` badge on
# `last_status === 'error'`, with `last_error` on hover), and the gateway
# re-alerts on a still-failing job hourly. Both of those run INSIDE the
# gateway, so neither can speak when the gateway is the thing that is wedged.
# Doctor is a separate process the user runs by hand, which is why the scan
# reads `crons.json` off disk rather than asking the gateway's HTTP API: a check
# whose purpose is to survive a down gateway must not depend on one.
#
# It also covers a gap the dashboard has by construction: the status badge is
# rendered under an `enabled` guard, so a job that auto-paused shows only
# "paused" and its error state is not displayed at all.
#
# The scan itself lives in `cron.unhealthy_jobs_from_disk` so the pause-state
# predicates keep their single owner (`_record_user_paused` / `_record_is_enabled`
# in `cron_service/store.py`); this module owns only the presentation.
#
# Read-only, like the rest of doctor: an auto-paused job has failed
# `_AUTO_PAUSE_THRESHOLD` times in a row and is usually paused for a good
# reason, so silently resuming it during a diagnostic would hide the very
# problem the user ran doctor to find. The remediation is a `Fix:` hint naming
# a cron verb that already exists.
