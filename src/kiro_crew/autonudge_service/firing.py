"""One tick: its terminal bounds, the fire, its bookkeeping and the re-arm.

:func:`_timer` is the body of every loop's timer task. It applies the kill switch and
the terminal bounds in their fixed order (cycle cap, approval hold, runtime budget,
start-failure stand-down) before a turn can be spent, lets the gate decide a quiet
tick, and runs :func:`_run_fire_cycle` inside the loop's fire window, which charges a
delivered turn exactly once, keeps a refused turn owed and decides the re-arm.
:func:`fire_now` brings the next cycle forward through that same body.

Its functions are :class:`~kiro_crew.autonudge.AutoNudgeService` methods: each is bound
on the class by name and runs against the service's state through ``self``, and a call
to any other service method goes through ``self`` too, so a patch on the instance
reaches it.

    settlement. A cycle cap or runtime budget running out first would end the
    patrol with items still open, and nothing re-arms it. So for such a loop the

    ``_LEDGER_EXTEND_MIN_RUNTIME_SECS``) -- and logged at WARNING. A user or agent
    stop is untouched: this runs only when the timer is about to apply a bound.

    The RUNAWAY BACKSTOP is the configured monitoring runtime ceiling
    (``monitoring.max_runtime_secs``, seven days as shipped), measured as the
    loop's age from ``created_ts``. Past it nothing is extended, the bound stops
    the loop as before, and that refusal is logged at WARNING too. A runtime
    extension is also clamped to the ceiling, so it never writes a budget the
    update path would refuse.

    again rather than firing from a tick that already passed the gate. False
    leaves the caller's terminal treatment in charge. A loop with no

    """Bring one loop's next cycle forward to now, out of band from its countdown.

    Returns ``(loop, "", 200)`` once the cycle is armed to run, or
    ``(None, reason, status)`` on refusal — the ``(obj, error, status)``
    shape the authz chokepoints in :mod:`kiro_crew.autonudge_authz` already
    use, so the HTTP handler stays a thin mapping.

    WHAT THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: it does not deliver the nudge
    itself. It re-arms through :meth:`_arm_timer`, so the cycle runs inside
    the ordinary :meth:`_timer` body — the stop sentinel, the cycle cap, the
    wall-clock budget, the approval hold and the probe gate all apply
    exactly as they do on a scheduled tick, and the delivery goes through the
    one ``_on_fire`` path. Calling :meth:`_run_fire_cycle` directly would have
    needed that whole ladder restated here, and a second copy of a
    five-condition gate is a divergence waiting to happen.

    ``delay=0.0`` rather than :meth:`_arm_from_deadline`'s
    ``_OVERDUE_REARM_SECS`` beat. That beat exists so an elapsed deadline
    does not ambush a user mid-conversation — they keep deferring it simply
    by typing. A manual trigger IS the user asking, so the condition the beat
    protects against is not present.

    Three refusals, and each one is load-bearing rather than defensive:

    * **Not registered** -> 404. Nothing to fire. This is also where the stop
      SENTINEL lands: it goes through ``remove``, so the loop is gone rather
      than merely inactive.
    * **Not active** -> 409. The non-removing terminal bounds — the cycle
      cap, the wall-clock budget and the failure stand-downs — all leave the loop
      registered but inactive, so this ONE condition covers them without
      restating the list. A manual press must not buy a turn past a bound the
      user armed.
    * **Mid-fire** -> 409. :meth:`_arm_timer` cancels the existing timer
      task, and during the fire window that task may be parked on
      ``_persist_locked()`` writing the delivered cycle; cancelling it there
      loses the ``cycle_count`` bump. This is the same window
      ``notify_turn_complete``/``notify_user_input`` defer around, and the
      same answer the sibling immediate-trigger route gives for a run
      already in flight (``POST /api/crons/{id}/run`` -> 409).

      ``defer_if_firing`` changes what happens AFTER that refusal, never the refusal
      itself: the loop is recorded so the end of the in-flight cycle re-arms at delay
      zero rather than toward the loop's deadline. Opt-in, because a caller with a
      person behind it reports the refusal and is pressed again, while the crew-log
      wake's caller is a drain thread with nobody to tell -- and a deadline re-arm on
      an hours-long patrol cadence would hold a worker's report for hours.
      The same flag marks the tick it does arm as a worker's push: that tick observes
      the subject instead of spending the post-wake follow-up, and a quiet answer keeps
      the loop's earlier deadline.

    NO SUSPENSION POINT, and that is the design rather than an omission.
    ``async def`` for the caller's convenience, but nothing inside awaits, so
    the guards and the arm are atomic with respect to the event loop: between
    reading ``loop`` and arming it, no other coroutine can run.

    This shape was arrived at the hard way and the history is worth keeping.
    An earlier revision wrote ``next_due_ts = time.time()`` and awaited a
    DURABLE persist before arming, so a restart between the press and the
    fire would resume overdue. That await was a suspension window, and this
    module has several writers to ``next_due_ts`` that hold NO lock while
    writing it — the quiet-tick re-arm on the gated-wake branch is one. Each
    guard added to close one writer's window exposed the next: a concurrent
    ``remove`` arming a stale object, a cancelled caller abandoning the write,
    a countdown entering ``_firing`` mid-persist, a quiet tick overwriting the
    deadline, then the refused path leaving its own value durably committed.
    Five rounds, each caused by the fix before it. The window is not closable
    at this call site, because the racing writers take no lock at all.

    SO THE WRITE IS GONE. ``_arm_timer(delay=0.0)`` is what brings the cycle
    forward: :meth:`_timer` sleeps the delay it is given and fires WITHOUT
    consulting ``next_due_ts``. The write was only ever for restart cosmetics,
    and that is exactly what is given up — a gateway restart between the press
    and the fire resumes on the loop's own schedule instead of overdue, and
    the operator presses again. That is the same degradation
    :meth:`_persist_soon` documents as acceptable for every other deadline
    assignment in this class ("a lost write degrades to a fresh full countdown
    after restart, never a premature or dropped fire"), and a far better trade
    than a sixth guard on an uncloseable window.

    The countdown reset callers ask for is UNAFFECTED, because it never
    came from this write: a delivered cycle clears ``next_due_ts`` in
    :meth:`_run_fire_cycle` and the re-arm then starts a fresh full interval.
