"""The per-loop timer tasks, the turn-lifecycle hooks that arm them, and the reconciler.

One cancellation policy (:func:`_cancel_timer`) retires a loop's timer task, and one
arming rule (:func:`_arm_from_deadline`) re-arms it toward the loop's persisted
deadline, so a user turn defers a pending fire without pushing the schedule back. The
dashboard's turn hooks (``notify_*``) are the reactive half: they cancel on user input,
resume on turn completion and record approval and start-failure evidence for the next
tick to act on, deferring around a loop's fire window. The reconciler is the backstop
that re-arms an active loop left with no live timer across two passes.

Its functions that take the service as ``self`` are
:class:`~kiro_crew.autonudge.AutoNudgeService` methods: each is bound on the class by
name and runs against the service's state through ``self``, and a call to any other
service method goes through ``self`` too, so a patch on the instance reaches it. The
plain helpers beside them are imported directly by the owners that use them.

    died (``error`` or ``timeout``). Evidence, not inference: the loop spent a
    turn and it failed, which is the one thing that distinguishes a loop making no
    progress from a quiet one.

    Only the loop's OWN cycle counts (the chat runner passes the self-wake guard,
    excluding the structural and session-start cases, before calling this), so a
    human turn that happened to error on a slot carrying a loop cannot spend the
    loop's stand-down budget. That is the same guard ``notify_cycle_start_failed``
    relies on, and for the same reason.

    Scoped to the fired loop by BOTH its id AND its ``config_generation``,
    captured at fire time (chat_runner passes ``_directive_loop_id`` and
    ``_directive_loop_gen``), matched under ``_lock`` so there is no TOCTOU
    window -- the same ``(id, generation)`` fence the structural-terminal verdict
    is applied under. The id guards the slot-reuse case the generation alone
    cannot: a loop A on this slot replaced by a fresh loop B that happens to carry
    the same slot and the same generation (both start at 0) would otherwise take
    A's stale failure onto B. The generation guards the revision case (A->B->A):
    a completion whose generation advanced under it describes the OLD instruction
    and must not stand the revised loop down. Either mismatch is a stale fault and
    is dropped.

    Durability (persist before you publish): the increment and its durable write
    happen together under ``_lock`` and the write is AWAITED. A write that
    genuinely fails rolls the live ``consecutive_failed_cycles`` back to what the
    store last held, so the stand-down never reads a count the store has not
    accepted. A ``CancelledError``, by contrast, is raised by the cancellation-
    safe writer ONLY after its executor future has settled, so on cancel the write
    DID land -- the committed increment is durable and is kept, never rolled back
    (rolling it back would erase an accepted failure and leave the live count one
    short of the store). The chat runner's terminal arm is async and awaits this,
    which is what lets it stage-then-write rather than detach the write the way a
    deadline-reassigning sync hook must. The stand-down DECISION still belongs to
    ``_timer``, which owns every terminal and scheduling decision and evaluates
    them serialized before a fire -- this only records the evidence.

    a just-delivered fire, a legacy store entry) starts a fresh full
    countdown from now, and the assignment is persisted through a
    supervised background write so a restart resumes this countdown

    interpret its policy -- so arming it would run the loop under a policy
    nobody here understands, which for the pre-gate code path means
    injecting the raw message every interval with no decision at all. The
    refusal is deliberately made HERE, on the arm, rather than by rewriting
    the record: the stored ``active`` intent belongs to the gateway that
    wrote it and must survive the downgrade so an upgrade resumes the watch.
    Inertness is the local consequence, not a change of intent.

    "No live timer" means the ``_timers`` entry is absent OR its task has

    from ``_timers`` when it completes normally, so the stranded states
    this backstop exists for (a delivered fire whose stop hook never came,
    a timer task killed by an exception) leave a DONE task behind rather
    than an empty slot -- a membership test alone would miss every one of
    them. The absent form covers a loop whose pending timer was cancelled
    by ``notify_user_input`` and whose ``notify_turn_complete`` then never
    arrived because the slot's turn died on a hook-skipping path.

    A loop is re-armed only after TWO CONSECUTIVE passes observe it
    eligible-and-unarmed, because one observation cannot tell "stranded"
    apart from two live states that look identical for a while:

    * A slot whose user turn is still running. ``notify_user_input``
      cancelled the timer on purpose, and ``notify_turn_complete`` will
      re-arm when the turn ends. The turn-start hook also clears this
      loop's candidacy (see ``notify_user_input``), so a session showing
      any sign of life defers its rescue by a full two intervals. A turn
      that outlives BOTH intervals is re-armed anyway -- one observation
      window has to end somewhere, and the fire path's busy-slot refusal
      (plus its backoff) keeps a rescue that guessed wrong from ever
      delivering into the running turn; the wasted attempt is the cost of
      rescuing the turn that died silently, which looks identical from
      here.
    * A loop inside another coroutine's mutation window. ``update()``
      mutates fields, awaits an offloaded store write, and ROLLS BACK the
      fields if the write fails -- a single-pass reconciler could arm the
      transiently-active shape and leave a rolled-back inactive loop with
      a live timer. Two passes shrink that window, but the write has no
      timeout, so the guard that CLOSES it is the lock check below: every
      mutation runs inside ``self._lock``, this pass is synchronous, and
      a pass that finds the lock held defers entirely.

    Deliberately never touched, whatever the passes observe:

    * A loop mid-fire (``_firing``): its running task must never be
      cancelled (see ``update``), and ``_arm_timer`` cancels before it
      creates. The fire window owns its own re-arm bookkeeping.
    * A loop quiesced by administrative cleanup: cleanup owns it.
    * A monitor record whose version this gateway does not implement:
      ``_arm_from_deadline`` refuses those with an INFO line, and letting
      the reconciler retry it would repeat that line every pass forever.
    * A monitor whose wake claim is in flight with NO completion-evidence
      deadline -- EXCEPT a ``BUSY`` retry. The no-deadline shape is a
      claim that died mid-handoff: ``_load`` retires it on restart, and
      arming it here would wake a controller that answers ``NO_CHANGE``
      forever (the probe path is never reached, so no budget or cap can
      end it) -- an unretirable zombie dressed as a rescue. A ``BUSY``
      delivery is the one no-deadline shape that is legitimately LIVE:
      it proves no action turn started, and ``_load`` resumes it at its
      persisted retry deadline, so this pass must too. A claim WITH a
      deadline is safe: its ``next_due_ts`` is that deadline, and the
      armed tick either finds evidence or retires the claim through
      ``record_monitor_completion_evidence_unavailable``.
