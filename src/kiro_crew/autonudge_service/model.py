"""The loop record, its stop-reason vocabulary and the predicates over one record.

:class:`NudgeLoop` is what ``autonudge.json`` stores one row as and what every
surface serializes. The reasons a loop records when it stops, the sets that decide
which of those stops a re-arm may displace, the error types the service raises, and
the functions that answer a question about ONE record (is it a structured monitor,
has its runtime budget run out, which session keys name a channel conversation, what
its cycle header says) live here with it, because each is a reading of the record's

# payload the backend rejects by shape, ``approval_stalled`` an unanswered
# approval, ``session_start_failures`` a cycle that never got a session at all.

# (as opposed to bare dashboard chat-slot keys). Channel-bound loops have no
# dashboard turn-lifecycle hooks (notify_turn_complete / notify_user_input),
# so they run on a fixed interval instead of an idle timer: the timer re-arms
# itself right after every delivered fire.
#
# This mirrors ``messaging.link.CHANNEL_SESSION_NAMESPACES``, spelled out here
# rather than derived from it, for two independent reasons:
#
# 1. IMPORT WEIGHT. ``autonudge`` is imported at module scope by ``mcp_core``
#    (i.e. by every MCP server process) and by the dashboard chat layer, and it
#    depends only on config/security/platform_compat today. Naming
#    ``kiro_crew.messaging.link`` runs ``messaging/__init__``, which pulls the
#    driver/renderer/transport layer and, transitively, the ACP client, agent,
#    hooks, artifacts, metrics and sqlite — measured at 48 additional
#    ``kiro_crew`` modules to obtain one tuple of string literals.
# 2. THIS IS A KEY-SHAPE QUESTION, NOT A LIVE-CAPABILITY ONE. ``is_channel_key``
#    selects the RE-ARM STRATEGY and the expiry-notification metadata, so it has
#    to answer identically whether or not the transport happens to be registered
#    at this instant. Deriving it from a runtime ``supports_proactive_send``
#    lookup fails toward the WRONG branch: a loop whose transport is momentarily
#    absent would read as a dashboard slot, so ``_run_fire_cycle`` would stop
#    self-re-arming it — and nothing else ever will, since
#    ``notify_turn_complete`` never fires for a channel key — while the expiry
#    notice would synthesize a ``dashboard:<namespace>:<id>`` jump link pointing
#    at no slot.
#
# Membership therefore does NOT assert deliverability; it asserts "this key names
# a conversation rather than a chat slot". Whether a nudge can actually be
# delivered stays with the fail-closed ladder ``chat_runner._resolve_channel_target``
# (defined in ``dashboard/chat_turn/recipient.py``: governance, then a REGISTERED
# transport, then ``supports_proactive_send``), which logs its reason and degrades
# to a no-op.
# So a namespace is listed even when nothing can currently be delivered to it,
# and the two clearest cases are both here: ``whatsapp`` has no transport package
# in this fork at all, and ``feishu`` ships one that declares
# ``supports_proactive_send=False`` (its renderer only replies to an inbound
# message id, so a nudge cycle has nowhere to put the answer). Both still classify
# as channel keys, because the alternative is worse than a refusal: an unlisted key
# is read as a dashboard slot and silently stops being re-armed, whereas a listed
# one reaches the ladder and is refused with a logged reason. Being listed is
# likewise not an arming permission — that is ``binding_key_for``, which is

    # the entire 671,900-char session file.

    # copy would delete real instruction, which is the opposite of the point.
