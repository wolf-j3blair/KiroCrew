"""Push-verdict tool — the agent PRESENTS a request; the gateway decides and records.

``schemas()`` returns the advertisement half; ``HANDLERS`` maps names to behavior. Same
template as ``ledger.py``, including reaching shared plumbing as ``mcp_core`` attributes so
tests that rebind them still intercept the handler.

This module deliberately writes NOTHING. It does not run git, does not read a ref, and does
not compute a verdict: it posts to ``/api/push-verdict/run`` and renders what the gateway
answered. That is the whole point of the design — the party a gate constrains cannot also be
the party that records the gate's result, so the check and the record both live in the
gateway process and the agent's side is a presenter.

The tool carries NO worktree argument for the same reason ``ledger.py`` carries no slot
argument: the backend resolves the target from the CALLING SESSION's own project directory.
A worktree parameter would let a session ask about a clean tree and then publish from a
different one, and the verdict would be true about the wrong repository.

#: How long the presenter waits for the gateway's ``/api/push-verdict/run`` verdict.
#:
#: The route is not a quick judgement: within ONE request the gateway primes a cold mirror
#: (base fetch + candidate fetch, a guard timeout each), runs the guard (another guard
#: timeout), resolves the effective target, re-fetches the remote tip, and then PERFORMS THE
#: PUSH ITSELF (the push timeout) -- the gateway is the publisher, so the whole publish runs
#: inside this request. The server-side legs are bounded by the handler's own per-step
#: timeouts (``_GUARD_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` on the fetches and the guard, ``_PUSH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``
#: on the push, ``_GIT_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` on the short reads); summed on the slowest path they
#: exceed 700s, so a presenter wait set near that bound expires DURING a legitimately slow
#: publish and ``_post``'s 30s client default expired long before any of it -- turning an
#: ordinary slow publish into a read-timeout the presenter rendered as a definite "Error:".
#: A transport failure on this route means the publish MAY STILL BE IN PROGRESS
#: (``_transport_failure``'s own contract forbids reading it as a rejection), so waiting for
#: the real verdict is the fix for the common case. Set with a clear margin ABOVE the summed
#: server call-chain bound so a legitimately slow publish is awaited to its real verdict, not
#: abandoned mid-publish.
