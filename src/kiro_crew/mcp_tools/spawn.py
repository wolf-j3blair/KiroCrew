"""The subagent spawning, steering, and host headroom tools: what they advertise and what they do.

``schemas()`` returns the ADVERTISEMENT half of each tool -- its name, the
model-facing description, and the JSON Schema a call is validated against.
``HANDLERS`` maps each of those names to the function that runs it. Both halves
of a tool live here so its contract and its behavior are read together, and
``test_mcp_tool_registry`` fails if one arrives without the other.

Handlers reach this server's shared plumbing as attributes of ``mcp_core`` --
``mcp_core._post``, the identity resolvers, the governance vets. That is
deliberate rather than untidy: an attribute lookup resolves at CALL time, so a
test that rebinds one on the module still intercepts the handler. Importing
those names directly here would bind them at import time and silently escape
every existing patch site.

    The roster is otherwise reachable only through ``spawn_list``'s OUTPUT, so a

    plausible-sounding names instead. Putting it in the parameter
    description puts it in front of exactly the caller that needs it.

    ADVISORY only, and deliberately never a gate: this process scans the
    user-level agents directory, while the gateway ALSO accepts a project-scope
    agent it cannot see from here. An incomplete roster is harmless as a hint --
    the gateway still owns the accept/refuse decision -- but refusing a name on
    this reading would reject an agent kiro-cli can load.

    Every name is matched against ``_AGENT_NAME_RE`` before it is rendered, then
    redacted, then the list is bounded -- all of it in
    ``subagent.visible_agent_names``, shared with the refusal roster and
    ``spawn_list`` so the filter cannot drift between them. The grammar is what
    makes this safe to put in front of a model: an agent spec's ``name`` field is
    taken verbatim by discovery with no validation, so a spec can declare a
    newline plus instruction-shaped text -- pure ASCII, and an isascii check would
    pass it straight into every session's tool list. The same grammar already
    gates the ``agent`` parameter in ``SPAWN_RUN_SCHEMA``, so a name that fails it
    is one no caller could pass here anyway.

    Skipped entirely when an event loop is running, because then this is NOT the
    stdio server: ``mcp_discovery._managed_tools_in_process`` imports this package
    and calls ``_list_tools()`` from ``async def probe_server`` on the gateway's
    loop, on hosts where the probe spawn is refused. A directory scan there would
    stall the loop -- and that caller keeps only tool NAMES, discarding every
    description, so it loses nothing. ``mcp_shared.run_mcp_stdio_loop`` is a plain
    select/readline loop that never imports asyncio, so the process that actually
