"""Per-domain MCP tool descriptors for the ``kirocrew-core`` server.

``build_tool_list`` is what ``mcp_core._list_tools`` answers ``tools/list``
from. Domain modules are imported lazily inside it so this package stays a
leaf at import time: ``mcp_core`` reads ``_limits`` from here at module
level, and an eager import of the domain modules would close that loop.

Adding a tool means adding its descriptor to the domain module and its
handler to ``mcp_core``; nothing here needs to change.
