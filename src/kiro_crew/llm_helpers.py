# cell-scoped and model-agnostic (a frontend admission-tier outage takes out
# ALL models in the cell), so deep per-candidate retries mostly re-confirm a

# whole of one match call (measured: a 5-8 s ``search`` on a worker left the
# main thread exactly one tick on 3.10 and 3.12), so the hop yields between
# strings, never within one. The ceiling is therefore the liveness bound for a
# single string as well as the WORKER's: an unbounded string parks the loop and
# the thread for as long as the scan takes, and the permission request behind
# it -- the turn -- waits with it.
#
# The anchor rewrite in this change cut the constant but NOT the growth -- the
# scan is still superlinear in the length of one line. Measured on one dev box:
#
#     4 KiB 0.16s | 8 KiB 0.31s | 16 KiB 1.14s | 20 KiB 1.52s | 32 KiB 3.79s
#
# 16->32 KiB is 3.3x for 2x the input (~n^1.7), so extrapolation is the wrong
# instinct here and a ceiling has to be set from the measured curve. A CI runner
# under parallel load came in roughly an order of magnitude slower than this box,
# which is what sets the margin: 20 KiB is ~1.5s here and ~15s there, under the
# 25s loop watchdog on both.
#
# Exceeding it is FAIL-CLOSED: the call is denied, never skipped. A skip would
# convert a liveness bug into a security hole by letting unscanned input through
# the deny surface; a denial only refuses input we cannot prove safe, and is
# strictly better than the alternative it replaces, which was crashing the
# gateway and losing the whole turn.
#
# Known cost of that trade: a permission-gated write of a benign file larger
# than this lands its whole content in ``tool_input`` and is refused WHEN the
# frame's provenance is unknown. An edit with trusted provenance is judged by
# its target path instead (``_edit_target_denial``), and every other non-shell

    What an edit can actually do is decided by WHERE it writes, so the gate for an

    every accepted path spelling in the params (``target_paths``) goes through

    The target set is the UNION of the params' path spellings and *diff_path*,
    the path the tool_call's ``{"type": "diff"}`` content block named. A backend
    may stream trusted params that carry no path key at all and name the file

    judge, and the document scan is not a fallback here -- a document that
    happens to contain no denied text is not evidence that the write is safe),
    and an UNANCHORED diff path (relative after ``~``/env expansion, which
    resolves against the gateway CWD rather than the agent workspace, so its
    sensitivity cannot be established -- see ``edit_target_candidates``). The
    caller reaches this on trusted provenance (see ``_resolve_permission``) or

# ── Tool Approval Policies ──


class ToolApprovalPolicy(Enum):
    """How to handle tool permission requests during streaming.

    ``READ_ONLY`` is the dashboard "Reads" approval mode's semantics ported to
    surfaces that have no interactive approver: provably read-only calls are
    auto-approved through the SAME hook gate the Reads mode uses (deny floor
    first, then the read-only classifier), and every call that is not provably
    read-only is rejected — where the Reads mode would ask, this policy
    refuses. Requires ``hooks``; without a gate to classify with it fails
    closed and rejects everything, exactly like ``REJECT_ALL``.

    Only the classifier's own verdict approves under ``READ_ONLY``. The hook
    gate is asked ``classifier_only``, so its GRANT tiers — the operator's
    ``auto_approve_tools`` globs and the app-own-server rule, which vouch for
    the caller and say nothing about what the call does — are skipped rather
    than honoured, and an auto-approve is then trusted only when the result
    carries the classifier's ``read_only`` tag. A grant that shadows a
    read-only call therefore still gets the read approved (by the classifier),
    and a grant that shadows a write approves nothing.

    With no approver to catch an over-approval, ``classifier_only`` also
    restricts proof to HOST-TRUSTED facts: the recovered shell command judged
    by ``is_read_only_bash``, or a built-in the host knows to be read-only
    (``hooks._HOST_READ_ONLY_BUILTIN_TOOLS``) named by the non-model-authored
    ``_meta.kiro.toolName`` with no MCP server behind it, and only when the
    event carries ``mcp_identity_trusted`` (the pair came from the
    provenance-verified caches, not an inline payload). The agent-influenced
    ACP ``kind`` and the model-authored title may narrow but never prove, so a
    mutating tool labelled ``kind="read"``, a read-looking title, and any
    MCP-served tool (no host-trusted read-only marker exists for one) are
    rejected here where the interactive Reads mode would still ask.

    A rejected permission reaches the model as kiro-cli's fixed "User denied tool
    execution", so without this it reads a refusal that never happened and
    abandons or routes around a call nobody objected to. Awaited immediately
    BEFORE each host-deny ``reject_tool`` in this module: while the permission
    request is still unanswered the turn is provably in flight, which is what
    gets the notice queued rather than dropped (see ``kiro_crew.deny_notice``).

    Every deny in this module is a HOST verdict, but *cause* says which kind,
    and it is REQUIRED because the wrong noun sends the model the wrong way.
    ``DENY_CAUSE_POLICY`` is for a safety rule judging the call itself (an
    always-deny pattern, a hook deny, a withheld name grant): its notice appends
    class-specific remediation keyed off the reason and the model's own title.
    ``DENY_CAUSE_SURFACE_POLICY`` is for the surface refusing the call (the
    reject-all / read-only policies, the tool-free background one-liner): no
    remediation, because on a surface where the tool cannot run at all, telling
    the model which sanctioned command to run instead -- triggered by nothing
    more than a credential-shaped word in its own title -- would be a second
    wall. ``DENY_CAUSE_INVALID_NAME`` is for the empty title, the one deny the
    model can simply fix. The one genuine USER rejection
    (``interactive_rejected``) must NOT call this: there kiro-cli's wording is
    the truth, and "this was NOT a user action" would be a lie.
    ``test_llm_helpers_deny_notice`` walks the file to keep both halves honest.

    *reason* may echo agent-authored text (a matched path, a hook's reason), so it
    is redacted here; the shared helper redacts the title. *title* overrides the
    event's own when a caller renders the call differently -- the channel agent
    stream (``kiro_crew.channel``) reuses this helper and names a permission
    request by ``event.text`` where ``event.title`` is empty. The reason is
    otherwise passed VERBATIM, as the chat runner does: a rule-authored refusal's
    fixed lead (``Blocked by security policy: ``, the unverifiable-path stall
    prefix) is the structural key ``deny_guidance.classify_deny`` reads before any
    text scan, and trimming it would let an agent-spelled path move a stall into
    the credential class. The synthetic reasons this module authors carry no lead
    of their own, since the notice writes ``Blocked: <title>: <reason>`` itself,
    and a title-less call (the empty-title deny) is named rather than left as a
    bare colon. Best-effort by
    construction: ``steer_refusal_notice`` probes ``supports_refusal_steer`` and swallows
    every failure, so a backend without a steer channel behaves exactly as before
    and the caller's reject always runs.

    Cancellation mid-steer (a timed background turn, a stalled pipe hitting the
    turn deadline) must still answer the wire: a stranded
    ``session/request_permission`` blocks the backend forever and wedges every
    later turn behind it, and the caller's own ``reject_tool`` is the statement
    the cancellation skips. The reject is scheduled as a strongly referenced
    task (``_orphan_rejects`` keeps it alive, ``_orphan_reject_done`` retires it

    wait for the reject, not even bounded: the cancellation IS the caller's
    deadline, and the pipe that stalled the steer is the pipe the reject drains
    into, so any wait here runs after the caller's budget is spent and stretches
    a declared bound (a 5 s ``run_bg_oneliner`` would resolve at 10 s). The
    event loop steps the orphan task while the caller unwinds. Whether it still
    reaches the wire depends on the caller's teardown: the multiplexed
    ``_ProviderBgSession.destroy()`` only releases its turn semaphore and the
    shared transport stays up, while a runtime-backed ``AcpSessionHandle`` is
    terminated by its ``destroy()`` and the write then fails -- which
    ``_orphan_reject_done`` reports as the unanswered request it is, the same
    end state the caller's own skipped ``reject_tool`` would have left behind,
    now visible in the log. The SEL row for the decision is already written --
    every caller audits before this await.

    the accumulated text.

    ``start_priority`` orders the session's start; FOREGROUND only for a caller a
    person is waiting on (rule: ``kiro_crew.start_priority``). ``timeout`` bounds
    the DRIVE only -- see the acquisition below for why it must not be cancelled.

    ``strict_model=True`` makes the requested ``model`` a hard requirement
    rather than a preference: a failed ``set_model`` override raises instead
    of silently degrading to the session default, and the reactive
    rejected-model fallback below is disabled. Callers whose RESULT is only
    meaningful on that exact model (e.g. the poisoned-conversation canary in
    chat_runner, which uses a success as evidence to discard a conversation
    served by that same model) must set it; ordinary best-effort callers
    (title/nav/folder generation) keep the default lenient behavior.

    Consolidates the identical "acquire a ``_bg`` session -> best-effort pin the
    cheap model -> drive the event loop -> ``destroy()`` in ``finally``" skeleton
    that was copied across title, link-label, folder-icon, and session-summary
    generation. The task is tool-free by contract: permission requests are
    rejected and **always** SEL-logged as ``denied`` — every permission decision
    must be audited (``backend-security-controls``). Callers may override
    ``sel_source`` to attribute the denial to their feature; callers that omit it
    are audited under the generic ``"bg_oneliner"`` source rather than silently
    dropping the SEL event.

    ``crew_log_kind`` and ``crew_log_session_key`` name what this call is and which
    session it is charged to, and BOTH are required for it to reach that session's
    crew log. Most callers are not charged to any one session -- a tip, a folder icon,
    a cron label -- so the default is to write nothing rather than attribute shared
    work to whichever session happened to trigger it.

    Errors propagate to the caller (the ``_bg`` session is still ``destroy()``-ed
    in ``finally``): callers that want best-effort "" fallback wrap the call
    themselves, while callers that surface the failure (title/nav) get it
    unchanged. ``sessions`` is duck-typed (a ``SessionManager``-like object
    exposing ``get_bg_session()``) rather than statically imported, so this
    low-level helper stays free of a dashboard/session import cycle.

    ``max_output_bytes`` bounds accumulated UTF-8 text before concatenation;
    ``retry_rejected_model=False`` disables the extra reactive model call for a
    caller that accounts each attempt against a hard call budget. Neither changes
    the configured-model resolution or the default behavior of other callers.

    ``stream_and_collect`` breaks on ``EVENT_COMPLETE`` and returns only text,
    discarding the event's ``usage``. Background surfaces that dispatch through
    it (cron, heartbeat, autonudge, workflow, task-runner self-review) therefore
    have no event to hand :func:`persist_token_record_async`. This recovers the
    turn's billing and wraps it in a ``TurnUsage`` so it can be passed straight
    through as the ``event`` argument.

    A turn can span several attempts: ``stream_and_collect`` retries a busy
    session and a transient backend error, and each retry installs fresh per-turn
    stats. Reading the provider's live stats afterwards therefore sees only the
    LAST attempt and loses any earlier attempt that was already billed. So the
    total ``stream_and_collect`` accumulated is preferred when present, and
    consumed here -- one turn's billing is reported once. Callers that drive
    ``provider.stream`` themselves publish no total and fall back to the live
    read, which is what ``since`` guards (see :func:`_attempt_usage`).

    The total is published WITH the stats object it was computed from, and is
    accepted only while that object is still the provider's current one. The
    provider outlives the turn -- the shared background session is reused by every
    background caller, and a Slack session by every turn in its thread -- so a
    total left unread by one turn would otherwise be consumed by the next one,
    billing that turn's spend to the wrong surface and losing its own. Today every
    reader happens to be paired with a publish in the same turn, which makes the
    residue unreachable; the guard is here so that safety does not depend on the
    next caller preserving that pairing. A fresh turn installs fresh stats, so a
    stale total simply fails the identity check and the live read takes over.

    On the kiro (acp) seam the only non-zero per-turn billing signal is
    ``credits``; on the claude seam the token counts, cache fields, and
    ``cost_usd`` are filled instead. Whichever dimensions the turn's stats
    carried come through :meth:`to_turn_usage` intact. Providers that expose
    no stats (non-ACP backends, test doubles) yield an empty ``TurnUsage``

    session afterwards. Callers that hand-rolled those steps had no reason to also

    ``task`` labels the work in the ``surface`` dimension as ``bg:<task>`` so spend
    is attributable per background job instead of pooling into one anonymous

    """Stream a message through an LLM provider and collect the full response.

    This is the core pattern used by cron, heartbeat, subagent, consolidator,
    taskrunner, and title generation.

    Args:
        provider: The LLM provider to stream through.
        message: The prompt to send.
        approval_policy: How to handle tool permission requests.
        hooks: HookManager for the HOOK_BASED and READ_ONLY approval policies.
            AUTO_APPROVE consults the shared identity-aware permission floor
            directly.
        on_chunk: Optional callback invoked with each text chunk (for progress).
        on_tool_approval: Optional async callback for interactive approval.
        on_steer_consumed: Optional callback invoked with the backend's
            ``steering_consumed`` echo text. A mid-turn steer is a
            fire-and-forget write, so this echo is the ONLY authoritative signal
            that the backend injected it; a caller that steers must observe this
            to know which of its steers to requeue when the turn ends.
        on_complete: Optional callback invoked with the provider's raw
            ``EVENT_COMPLETE``. It is not invoked when the stream exhausts or
            the caller cancels before that event. Raising from the callback is
            swallowed so observation cannot fail the completed turn.
        on_tool_gate: Optional callback invoked once per tool permission
            decision with ``(tool_title, approved, security_blocked)``. Lets a
            caller tell "the model did work" apart from "every tool the model
            attempted was blocked" — a distinction the returned text cannot
            carry, because a model whose tools were all refused still returns
            plausible prose. ``security_blocked`` is True only for the
            unconditional deny checks (sensitive path, sensitive bash, a deny
            pattern); a governance ``TOOL_DENY`` and an unattended-approval
            timeout are refusals that say nothing about the job, so they arrive
            with ``approved=False`` and ``security_blocked=False``.
            Delivered when the attempt settles, not mid-stream, and decisions
            from an abandoned retry attempt are discarded: they describe work
            the final turn never did. ``tool_title`` is LLM-authored: redact it
            before display or persistence. Raising from the callback is
            swallowed; observing a gate decision must never fail the turn.
        retry_transient: When True (default), transient backend errors are
            retried in-place with bounded backoff. Set False from callers that
            already own an outer transient-retry loop, so the inner arm doesn't
            compound their attempts (retry-layer amplification).
        max_turns: Optional cap on tool-call iterations per prompt. When reached,
            the event loop breaks and returns whatever text has been collected.
            None (default) means no limit.
        session_key: Calling surface's session key, forwarded to the PreToolUse
            gate. Empty (default) preserves every existing caller's behavior.
        agent: Calling agent name, forwarded to the gate alongside *session_key*.
        app: Owning app name, forwarded to the gate so the app's governance
            PROFILE is resolved — not just the enterprise ceiling.

            All three matter for ``AUTO_APPROVE``, ``HOOK_BASED``, and
            ``READ_ONLY`` callers. The gate resolves ``ceiling ∩ profile``, and
            it can only look up a profile it has been told the name of; with all
            three empty it applies the ceiling alone. ``REJECT_ALL`` runs no
            tools. Every other policy consults the gate before an approval.
        fallback_models: Ordered chain of model ids tried when the same-model
            transient budget exhausts on a throttle/capacity error (Case 2.75).
            Empty (the default) disables the chain — behavior is byte-for-byte
            today's fail-loudly. Requires ``retry_transient=True`` (a caller
            that owns the outer transient loop also owns any fallback policy).
            Every swap is logged at warning and published on the provider via
            :data:`TURN_FALLBACK_ATTR`; the swap is sticky for the session and
            a later call on the same provider probes one primary restore.
        allow_image: ``False`` sends every attempt text-only (see
            ``LLMProvider.stream``), for a prompt that is text ABOUT a session.

    Returns:
        The complete response text.

    """Save a turn without blocking (or fail-fast-dropping on) the event loop.

    Returns the ``ts`` of the row this turn ended on, read back INSIDE the atomic
    hold so it is this turn's own row and not some later writer's. A caller that
    stamps something with "how far the conversation had got" needs that value, and
    re-reading the tail afterwards is not the same thing: the permit for this
    session is released before the caller gets here, so a queued second turn can
    land its rows in between and the re-read would return ITS position. Taking the
    value under the lock we already hold costs nothing and removes the window
    rather than narrowing it.

    :func:`save_conversation_turn` makes TWO ``ConversationLog.append`` calls, and
    append acquires a cross-process flock and writes to disk -- ~12 ms each on a
    large transcript. Called directly from an ``async def`` that is worse than
    slow: on a running loop ``_locked`` makes a single NON-blocking acquire and
    raises :class:`~kiro_crew.history.HistoryLockTimeout` on any concurrent
    holder, and most callers swallow that, so the durable copy was dropped
    exactly when another writer was active. Off the loop the same primitive takes
    the patient poll-to-deadline path instead.

    This is the single choke point for every async caller, so the offload cannot
    be forgotten at a new call site and the ten Slack sites do not each restate
    it.

    Unlike :func:`~kiro_crew.history.append_off_loop`, this **awaits** the write
    rather than firing it at the executor and returning. That difference is
    deliberate: callers here go on to refresh a dashboard tab or hand the session
    to consolidation, both of which read the transcript back, so the turn has to
    be on disk before the caller continues. ``append_off_loop`` has no such
    reader and can afford to be fire-and-forget.

    The whole turn is written under one :meth:`~kiro_crew.history.ConversationLog.atomic_appends`
    hold. ``append`` locks per ROW, so without it two concurrent turns for the
    same session could interleave into ``user_A, user_B, assistant_A,
    assistant_B`` -- turns that do not pair up, which no timestamp ordering can
    repair because each row's ``ts`` is individually correct. On the loop that was
    impossible (a synchronous caller never yields between its two appends), so the
    hazard is introduced BY offloading and has to be closed here rather than
    inherited.
