"""The one request-free way to stop an app's code.

Two callers need to make an app's code stop running: ``POST /api/apps/{name}/disable``
and revoking that app's third-party execution grant. Before this module the revoke
path carried a hand-maintained copy of the disable handler's sequence, and a copy is
a defect with a delay on it: any step added to the handler later would silently not
run on revoke, recreating the "revoke reported success while the backend kept
executing" bug that shipped in the first draft of the grant feature.

So the sequence lives here once, and it deliberately takes NO aiohttp request. The
disable handler's request-bound tail — notification-channel unregistration, the
builtin module's ``on_disable(app)`` hook, builtin service sync — stays in the
handler: those need ``request.app``, and none of them are what makes third-party
code stop. What does is here, in order:

1. ``on_app_disable`` — Python shutdown hooks, route deregistration, cron cleanup.
2. ``stop_app_backend`` — the backend PROCESS. Skipping this is what let a revoked
   app keep running with its app secret and its routes still proxied.
3. ``deregister_app`` — agents, skills, MCP servers.

Ordering matters: hooks first (the app gets to shut down cleanly), then the process,
then the registrations, so nothing re-registers behind us.

Both blocking steps are offloaded to the subprocess executor — ``stop_app_backend``
signals a process group and waits, ``deregister_app`` walks and rewrites registry
files — because this runs on the gateway's event loop, where a slow filesystem would
stall every other request and the heartbeat.

      app-owned state on a routine off-switch.
    * ``True`` — **trust withdrawal** (a security operation: revoke, or the blanket
      falling-edge sweep). Deregistration is unconditional, because ``resources``
      is a field of the app's own ``installed.json`` — writable by any app trusted
      to run code — so honoring it here would hand the app a switch for evading its
      own teardown. The trade is deliberate and only defensible in this direction:
      the operator has withdrawn permission for this app's code to be in the

    #   (b) "revocation can leave DETACHED app code running" — `kirocrew app
    #       disable` is metadata-only and cross-process, so `enabled` can read
    #       false while a helper the app detached is still alive; that helper is
    #       not the tracked backend, so no port is observed either, and the only
    #       thing that knows how to stop it is the app's own `onDisable`.
    #
    # Both are real, and they cannot both be honoured on the revoke path. (b) wins:
    # leaving third-party code running after the operator revoked its permission
    # defeats the entire point of the operation, whereas (a) is not a privilege
    # escalation — running the app's own documented shutdown hook is about its
    # EXECUTION grant (its right to run code), which the config write retires after
    # teardown, for the sole purpose of giving it up. It gains no EXECUTION power it
    # did not have, and `onDisableTimeout` bounds the cost. Its CONTRIBUTION
    # authority (event-log grants) is a separate grant and is retracted BELOW,
    # BEFORE the hook runs, so the hook cannot append a permanent event under an
    # authority teardown is removing.
    #
