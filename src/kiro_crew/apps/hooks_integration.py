"""Hooks Integration — wires the hooks system into the gateway lifecycle.

This module provides the glue functions that connect:
- RouteRegistry into the enable/disable flow
- LifecycleDispatcher into gateway startup/shutdown
- CronSDK cleanup into disable/uninstall

These functions are called from routes.py and server.py at the appropriate
lifecycle points. An app that declares no hooks is a no-op.

    Folds ONLY hook-relevant inputs so a metadata write that does not touch hook
    code never forces a reload: the app version, a digest of the declared hook
    source files' (path, mtime, size), and the ``.app_secret`` mtime (a reinstall
    rotates it, and the live module must pick up the new secret). Deliberately
    EXCLUDES two things:

    * ``installed.json`` mtime -- a dashboard permissions/config edit rewrites
      that file without changing any hook, and reloading a healthy running app on
      such an edit would discard its in-flight hook state for nothing.
    * the ``enabled`` flag -- enablement is an ORTHOGONAL axis the reconciler
      already checks separately (it disables a loaded app that turned off and
      loads an enabled one), so folding it in here caused a spurious mismatch: a
      denied/disabled path records a signature computed from an ``enabled=False``
      copy, then the next poll (which re-reads ``enabled=True`` from disk) sees a
      different signature and runs a needless shutdown/startup cycle against the
      no-op it was promised. The signature answers "did the hook CODE change",
      not "is the app on".

    Blocking: it ``stat``s the declared hook files and ``.app_secret``. On the
    gateway event loop (the dashboard enable/disable handlers, the boot pass) it
    must be reached via :func:`compute_hook_signature`, which offloads it; the
    reconcile loop runs it inside its own ``to_thread`` step. Kept here, beside
    the registry it feeds, so every driver computes the identical value.
