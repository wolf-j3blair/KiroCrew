    The prefetch prefers the local checkout, so a checkout left sitting at a
    rejected state makes every retry re-reject at prefetch before it could
    ever pull a fixed remote — a permanently stuck app.

    A checkout created THIS RUN is deleted (no residue) and, when the run
    replaced a moved-aside previous checkout (*restore_from*), that previous
    checkout is renamed back into the slot — otherwise the rejection would
    leave the slot empty and strand the user's old workspace as a
    sweeper-doomed ``.stale-*`` sibling.

    A pre-existing workspace is rolled back to its pre-pull commit with
    ``git reset --keep`` (preserves uncommitted local edits; aborts on
    conflict), then the manifest is restored to its exact pre-update
    working-tree bytes (*manifest_snapshot*) — undoing whatever the pull,
    build, or ``onInstall`` script did to ``app.json`` WITHOUT discarding the
    user's own uncommitted manifest edits. Only when no snapshot exists does
    it fall back to ``git --literal-pathspecs checkout --`` from HEAD
    (literal pathspecs keep an index-controlled subdirectory from being
    parsed as pathspec magic). Best-effort throughout: a cleanup failure is
    logged, never raised — the refusal it follows must stand regardless.

    *manifest_relpath* is the untrusted registry-declared manifest path the
    caller built (``f"{subdirectory}/app.json"``, or plain ``app.json`` when
    no subdirectory was declared). A build step or ``onInstall`` script runs
    with write access to the checkout BEFORE some callers reach this cleanup,
    and can plant a symlink at the manifest path — the subdirectory OR the
    leaf — after an earlier containment check already passed; this restore
    then runs unsandboxed as the Kiro Crew process, so it must not trust that
    earlier check. Containment of the FULL manifest path is re-verified HERE,
    at the point of the write, against the CURRENT on-disk state: on a
    failure the manifest restore (both the raw-write and the git-checkout
    fallback) is skipped so neither can be redirected outside *pkg_dir*
    through a symlink planted after the caller's check. The pre-pull
    ``git reset`` above is unaffected — it targets the whole checkout, not
    the manifest path.

    This is the RUNTIME'S OWN condition, not an approximation of it: the
    out-of-process half is :func:`runtime_provisions_requirements`, the predicate
    both provisioners themselves call (``apps/backend.py`` at the spawn of a
    FILE-style ``backend.entryPoint``, ``apps/bridges.py`` at the registration of
    a stdio ``mcpServers`` entry), so a shape they refuse -- a module-style,
    dotted entry point, which executes trusted package code and never has an
    app-dir requirements file installed for it -- fails here too instead of
    passing an install whose dependencies land nowhere.

    The in-process half is this gate's own: a declared ``backend.hooks`` field is
    imported INTO the gateway process (``lifecycle.py``, ``route_registry.py``),
    which the deps tree never reaches, so an app declaring one has Python that
    must import from the gateway's interpreter after all -- waiving for it would
    install the app "successfully" with its hook imports broken and its routes
    degraded, the silent-broken install the loud refusal exists to prevent.

    *self_managed* is the registry entry's resource ownership (``resources:
    "app"``), which no manifest field carries and which decides whether either
    provisioner ever RUNS for this app: ``install_from_registry`` registers a
    self-managed app from its manifest alone -- no source is copied into the app
    directory, ``bridges.py`` skips every registration for it, and the app
    launches itself -- so the runtime never sees its ``requirements.txt``. On a
    source install the build step's ``pip install -r`` was the only thing that
    installed that file, and that step is exactly what the bundled interpreter
    cannot run: waiving for a self-managed app would report a successful install
    whose dependencies landed nowhere, so it keeps the refusal regardless of what
    its manifest declares. Required rather than defaulted, for the same reason
    *manifest* is on :func:`_run_app_build`: the permissive value must be stated
    by a caller that knows the entry, never inherited.

    *final* says which pass is asking. The union is the provisioners' exact
    condition, and the backend half requires the entry FILE to exist -- but the
    build pass runs before ``setup.onInstall``, whose window is exactly where an
    app may generate that file, so with ``final=False`` a declared Python-script
    entry that is merely absent still counts (nothing is pip-installed either
    way); with ``final=True``, on the post-script checkout, the union is applied
    as is and an entry that never appeared is refused there.

    Answers from the TYPED manifest, which is what decides what actually loads:
    ``manager.py`` hands the loaders ``AppManifest.from_json_file(...).to_dict()``,
    so a declaration ``BackendConfig.from_dict`` normalizes away is a hook the
    loaders never see either, and ``bridges.py`` reads ``manifest.mcpServers`` from
    the same typed object. *installed* is the tree the entry-point shape is
    judged against -- the copy ``install_app`` would produce from *source*, the
    checkout, which the spawn later resolves the same name under; *source* is
    read by the BUILD pass alone, to tell a declared entry file that is merely
    absent from the checkout (the script's window may still create it) from a

    """The desktop app's build-step refusal for this checkout, or ``""`` when it may install.

    The ONE owner of that verdict. :func:`_run_app_build` asks it before planning
    any Python build command (``final=False``), and :func:`install_from_registry`
    asks it again on the FINAL checkout (``final=True``) -- after the build and
    ``setup.onInstall`` have run with write access -- so the waiver the build
    granted is re-derived from what actually registers rather than trusted
    across a script that can add ``backend.hooks`` or drop the out-of-process
    consumer it was granted for. The two passes differ in one respect only:
    ABSENCE. The script's window is where an app may generate its entry file or
    the target of its ``requirements.txt`` link, so the build pass lets a
    declared entry that is merely missing, or a link that is merely dangling,
    through (nothing is pip-installed either way) and the final pass refuses
    them if they never appeared; every other refusal is the same in both.
    Both callers are coroutines and run it through ``asyncio.to_thread``: the
    layout probes below are filesystem stats and one small copy, and
    ``KIROCREW_HOME`` can sit on a network mount that stalls, which on the event
    loop would freeze the gateway and its liveness heartbeat with it.

    Judges the same layout the build detects, in the same order: nothing on a
    gateway that is not the bundled interpreter; nothing when ``package.json``
    selects the JavaScript build (the Python files are not examined then); the
    refusal for ``pyproject.toml`` / ``setup.py``, which install INTO this
    interpreter; then, for a ``requirements.txt`` that is present, the refusal
    for one the runtime does not provision (:func:`_requirements_owned_by_the_runtime`,
    which *self_managed* -- the registry entry's resource ownership -- feeds) or
    will not READ (:func:`~kiro_crew.apps.manifest.requirements_in_tree`, the
    provisioner's own acceptance rule: a link escaping the app root, a dangling
    one, a non-file, an oversized one); ``""`` for one it does, and for a
    checkout with no Python build files at all.

    Those two checks are asked of the tree the install PRODUCES, not of this
    checkout: :func:`_installed_tree_preview` runs ``install_app``'s own copy
    (:func:`~kiro_crew.apps.manager.copy_app_tree_as_installed`) into a temporary
    directory and the predicates read that. The provisioner and the spawn read
    the APP DIRECTORY, and the copy drops build-input names at any depth, omits a
    link that escapes the root, keeps an in-tree link as a link with its text as
    written, rewrites an absolute in-tree link, and -- on an update -- meets
    ``data/`` as the preserved previous directory; a layout that resolves in the
    checkout and not after all of that (a link into ``node_modules``, an entry
    under ``data/``, a link whose text climbs above the root and re-enters by
    naming the checkout) is missing in the preview exactly as it would be missing
    there, and the runtime's own predicates refuse it with no rule of this
    function's predicting what the copy does. A preview the copy itself cannot
    produce is an ordinary install error, retryable and without this code: the
    install would fail on the same copy, and the app's author has nothing to fix.
    A preview the copy produces and the INSTALL would refuse -- a root ``data``
    that is not a directory, which ``install_app`` turns away before writing its
    record -- raises that refusal (:class:`~kiro_crew.apps.manager.InstalledTreeRefused`)
    through this gate unchanged, so the transaction refuses before the copy into
    the app directory is ever made, and without this code: the layout is the
    author's to fix on every host.

    Presence is ``lexists``, the provisioner's own notion: a dangling
    ``requirements.txt`` link is "present but not a readable regular file" to
    ``provision_app_deps``, which records a provisioning FAILURE and lets the
    backend spawn without its deps (the failure written at the top of its log,
    the import error following) -- so with a consumer declared it is refused
    here rather than waived into an install whose backend cannot run. With NO
    consumer nothing of ours would
    ever read it, and the build's own detection (``is_file``, on every host)
    sees no file: it passes, as it does on a source install.

    the install's own copy into a temporary directory and removed on exit.

    :func:`~kiro_crew.apps.manager.copy_app_tree_as_installed` is the same call
    ``install_app`` makes plus the gateway's own post-copy part -- told, as the
    install will find out, whether a preserved ``data/`` awaits
    (:func:`~kiro_crew.apps.manager.preserved_data_awaits`) -- so the verdict
    derived from this tree cannot drift from the copy: the copy IS the model.

    WHERE the copy lands is part of the model too. The runtime resolves the
    installed tree's links from ``app_dir(name)`` -- ``<data home>/apps/<name>``
    -- and a relative link text that climbs out of the tree and re-enters it by
    NAME resolves by the names actually around it: ``requirements.txt ->
    ../app/requirements/prod.txt`` is in-tree in a checkout whose leaf directory
    is ``app`` (a registry ``subdirectory`` of that name) and dangles, or lands in
    another app's directory, once installed under ``apps/<name>``. So the preview
    is written under the destination's own leaf name, *name* -- the manifest's
    validated app name, the single directory component ``app_dir`` joins -- and a
    text that re-enters by that name resolves here exactly as it will there. The
    leaf is what decides: a text that climbs further re-enters by the names ABOVE
    the leaf, and the copy judges those texts where it runs, in the checkout --
    one that names the checkout's own ancestors resolves outside the root from
    the app directory and from here alike, and one that names anything else
    escapes the checkout and is omitted by the copy before either place sees it.

    The holder is a ``<name>.partial-<8 hex>`` sibling of the checkout under
    app-sources: the filesystem the install writes to (the one the copy's
    case-folding probe must answer for), and the one name the retention sweep
    already retires, so a copy an unclean gateway exit leaves behind mid-install
    goes the way of any other abandoned partial tree after
    :data:`_STALE_CHECKOUT_RETENTION_DAYS` days instead of accumulating.

    A copy that fails (disk full, a permission) raises an ordinary error carrying
    the cause -- the transaction reports it as any other install failure, without
    the permanent ``desktop_build_step_unsupported`` code, because a retry may
    well succeed and the app's author has nothing to fix. A copy that SUCCEEDS
    into a tree the install refuses -- a root ``data`` that is not a directory,
    which ``install_app`` turns away before writing its record -- raises the
    install's own :class:`~kiro_crew.apps.manager.InstalledTreeRefused` through
    here unchanged: the author's to fix, permanent, and reported by the
    transaction as the refusal it is (not this gate's desktop code, which would
    tell the reader a browser install could succeed). Blocking filesystem
    work, for a worker thread: app trees are small (the copy drops ``.git``,

    checkout that will actually stay retained after this call.

    CONTRACT: this is the ONLY owner of the "Previous checkout retained at"
    wording — no exit re-implements the string. It has exactly TWO call sites,
    and neither is a per-exit copy of the other:

    - the ``finally`` of :func:`install_from_registry`, AFTER that ``finally``
      has run its restore block. This is the ordinary path: it reaches EVERY
      normal exit (success and refusal alike) via the single ``finally``,
      passing the returned ``build_result`` and ``filter_restorable=not
      durable_success`` so the flag is derived once, never hand-mirrored.
    - the exception handler in :func:`_clone_build_app` (the ``except`` that
      re-raises a build error). That path produces NO result dict — the
      exception propagates instead of returning — so the ``finally`` above
      never sees the move-aside state. This second call synthesises a minimal
      dict from that scope's ``pending_cleanup``/``restorable_stale`` and
      passes ``filter_restorable=True`` (the handler restored the same-origin
      subset just above it), so a non-restorable ``.stale-*`` on the
      exception path is still named instead of being silently swept.

    Both routes funnel the wording through here precisely so they can never
    drift: hand-replicating the reporter across every exit, with a
    ``filter_restorable`` flag manually mirrored to ``durable_success`` at each
    one, is the scattered-per-exit stranding class the caller's move-aside
    bookkeeping exists to avoid — a new exit could forget the call or pass the
    wrong flag and silently strand or double-report a checkout. Every normal
    exit reaches the single ``finally`` call and derives the flag once; the only
    other caller is the exception path that no ``finally`` return can cover.

    ``_pending_stale_cleanup`` collects every move-aside regardless of
    reason, but ``_restorable_stale`` (a subset) is put back by the
    enclosing ``finally`` — and ONLY when the exit leaves ``durable_success``
    False. The single call passes ``filter_restorable=not durable_success``,
    exactly the restore condition, so the flag can never drift from it:

    - On a failure exit (``durable_success`` False) the ``finally`` restored
      the restorable stale just before this call, so ``filter_restorable`` is
      True and that path — now back in place on disk — is filtered out rather
      than misreported as retained.
    - On a durable-success exit (``durable_success`` True) the ``finally``
      restores nothing, so ``filter_restorable`` is False and a restorable
      stale genuinely retained at ``.stale-*`` is reported instead of sitting
      unlogged until the age-based sweep — the possible-data-loss case this
      covers. A durable-success exit includes one where provenance
      persistence raised AFTER ``durable_success`` was set: the generic
      ``except`` catches it, the ``finally`` still sees ``durable_success``
      True, and this reporter names the retained stale.
