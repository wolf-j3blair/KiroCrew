#: Variables an ``openCommand`` launcher needs in order to reach the running
#: desktop session, copied through on top of the :func:`minimal_env` allowlist
#: (which has none of them). Every name here is a LOCATION HINT -- a display
#: number, an X authority file path, a bus address, a session flavour -- so
#: copying them widens what the child can FIND, never what it can
#: authenticate as. Enumerated rather than pattern-matched: a prefix rule over
#: the parent environment is how a credential reaches an app-authored shell by
#: accident. ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` is absent because the allowlist already
#: carries it.
#:
#: ``DBUS_SESSION_BUS_ADDRESS`` belongs here, and withholding it would buy
#: nothing. Three things decide that.
#:
#: The sandbox owns it, not this list. ``sandbox._CGROUP_SCOPE_BUS_ENV_KEYS``
#: pairs it with ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` as the ``systemd-run --user`` wrapper's
#: OWN dependency: the cgroup ceiling needs the caller's session bus to place
#: the child in a scope, so both are restored after the credential scrub and
#: then dropped again INSIDE the scope with an ``env -u`` shim. A sandboxed
#: child therefore never keeps either one, whatever this list says.
#:
#: Dropping the address closes no door anyway. libdbus falls back to
#: ``$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/bus``, and ``XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`` is in ``minimal_env``'s
#: allowlist because it is also where the Wayland socket lives -- so removing
#: it to close the fallback would break every Wayland launch, which is the
#: legitimate use this endpoint exists for.
#:
#: What is left reaches only the operator's opt-in unconfined mode, where the
#: same shell can already run any program it likes. Withholding a bus address
#: from a process that can spawn anything is not a control.

    Returns enabled apps' publish providers plus the core deploy provider (folded
    from the former deploy_web app), each with a ``configured`` flag. Built-in
    providers (the internal registry) are registered frontend-side and are not returned here.

    The core deploy row is omitted when EITHER control closes the public-web
    path, and the two are independent:

    * the platform's ``external_access`` policy withholds cloud deployment; or
    * the publish-governance chokepoint denies its destination id (governance
      ceiling ∩ ``publish.allowed_destinations``), so an operator who has closed
      the path never sees the button.

    Because this list is what the Publish panel renders, that single omission is
    also what makes the panel correct — a deployment that registers only an
    internal destination shows only that one, with no frontend change. Omission is
    presentation only: ``/api/deploy/deploy`` consults the same chokepoint itself,
    because a filtered list is not a control.

    On EITHER closed path, rows carrying ``DEPLOY_WEB_PROVIDER_ID`` are dropped
    from the app-declared list too — the platform withhold and the governance
    denial share one closed path for exactly this reason.
    ``collect_publish_providers`` validates
    a declared *endpoint* (it must sit under the app's own namespace) but not the
    declared *id*, so an enabled app may publish a row under the core
    destination's id — and ``PublishHub`` routes a click at
    ``selected.app.endpoint``, which this chokepoint does not cover. Serving that
    row after the operator closed the destination would hand back the path they
    closed.

    On the PERMITTED path such a row is left alone. An app shadowing this id is
    pre-existing, reachable behaviour that ``test_publish_providers`` documents
    (its fixture app declares this very id and the test asserts the APP's endpoint
    is the one resolved for it, first-match order). Whether the core provider
    should own the id outright is a behaviour change worth making on its own
    merits, not a side effect of closing a denial hole.

        # caller of this lock outside `dashboard/handlers` reaches it (see
        # `mcp.py`, `messaging.py`, `core.py`, `computer_use.py`,
        # `mcp_discover.py`) — the lock has no neutral home yet, and giving it one

        # name, so it serializes exactly the reinstall that would collide.
        #
        # On success only: a failed uninstall leaves nothing changed, so a
        # still-installed app keeps the pointers its slots are still entitled to
        # resume. Not in `deregister_app` (Step 3) — that also runs on disable, and
        # App Store Sync is a disable/enable pair.
        #
        # Enumerated AND cleared through the LIVE session map, never a throwaway
        # `SessionMap`: this gateway holds a long-lived map whose `_data` loaded at
        # startup and whose every write rewrites the whole file from that snapshot.
        # Both halves follow from that one fact.
        #
        # Writing detached would be undone by the next unrelated mutation —
        # restoring the very pointer just dropped — and would take whatever the live
        # map had not flushed with it (`SessionMap`'s rule 3).
        #
        # READING detached is the same fact from the other side: the file lags this
        # map by exactly what it has not flushed, so a detached enumeration can omit
        # a key whose pointer already exists, and the clear then leaves that pointer
        # for a reinstall to resume. `mapped_session_keys()` is the in-memory answer;
        # `session_keys()` adds a key whose allocation is in flight and has not
        # reached the map yet. Ownership still comes from the metadata line on disk,

        # the uninstalled app cannot re-record a sid from the session it was holding.
        #
        # ONE pass, and the window it leaves is NAMED rather than narrowed. An
        # allocation already reserved is inside `session_keys()`, so it is enumerated

        # reaches it: closing that window means holding admission against this app's
        # keys for the duration of the uninstall, and the only admission gate on the
        # manager sets `_closing` PROCESS-WIDE — it would refuse turns for every app
        # and every conversation while one app uninstalls, which is the larger harm.
        # A per-key admission gate is a change to the allocation boundary, owned by
        # whoever owns that boundary, not by this cleanup step. So the residual is

    SILENTLY: a failed fetch overwrites the catalog cache with a failure
    sentinel and the store quietly falls back to the seed listing, and without
    an explicit refresh the user's only remedy is waiting out ``CACHE_TTL``.

    Deliberately OUTSIDE ``/api/apps/``: token_auth's ``_app_owns_path``

    ``registry`` the power to purge the shared catalog caches without
    declaring the permission. Under ``/api/app-store/`` no app name can
    collide, so an app token reaches this endpoint only through an explicit
    ``permissions.api`` grant.

    Two more deliberate shapes:

    - A POST, not a ``?refresh=1`` on the GET: deleting caches and triggering
      outbound fetches is a state change, and a state-changing GET is reachable
      by cross-site top-level navigation with a valid SameSite=Lax cookie --
      exactly the request the CSRF middleware never sees.
    - It only DROPS caches -- it never fetches. The follow-up GET pays the
      fetch on the exact same code path as a cold start, so refresh cannot
      behave differently from the load it is trying to repair.

#: largest UI asset a bundled app in this tree ships is ~9 KB
#: (``website/public/apps/agent-worlds/ui/index.mjs`` — the scaffold's vite
#: config externalizes react/react-dom/the SDK, so bundles stay small). 8 MiB
#: is ~900x that, matches the posture already accepted for ``_ART_MAX_BYTES``
#: above, and still clears any plausible self-bundled entry chunk. The one
#: class it can refuse is the sourcemap of an app that bundles a very heavy
#: dependency — a ``.map`` 404 degrades only devtools debugging of that app,
#: never the app itself.
_UI_MAX_BYTES = 8 * 1024 * 1024

#: Read granularity when streaming a UI file from its validated descriptor.
#: This — not the file size — is what one in-flight request pins in memory, so
#: N slow clients cost N chunks, not N files. 256 KiB keeps the thread-hop
#: count low (an 8 MiB worst case is 32 hops) while staying far below any
#: amplification concern.
_UI_STREAM_CHUNK = 256 * 1024

#: Max concurrent requests HOLDING AN OPEN DESCRIPTOR on this route. Acquired
#: before `_open_ui_file` and released after the descriptor closes: bounding
#: only the streaming loop would let every QUEUED request already hold an fd
#: while waiting for a slot, so slow-paced unauthenticated GETs could walk the
#: gateway to `EMFILE`. Under this scope at most 8 descriptors exist at once
#: and everyone else waits fd-less. It also bounds the per-chunk `to_thread`
#: hops on the SHARED default executor (same reason `_BLOB_FETCH_SEMAPHORE`
#: bounds git fetches). Refusals and body-less 304s hold a slot only for
#: microseconds; 8 comfortably covers a dashboard loading assets in parallel.
_UI_STREAM_SEMAPHORE = asyncio.Semaphore(8)

#: Wall-clock ceiling on the body-writing phase of one UI-file response, and so
#: on how long one client can hold a `_UI_STREAM_SEMAPHORE` permit while pacing
#: the writes itself. Without a deadline the 8 permits are a head-of-line queue
#: an UNAUTHENTICATED caller controls: 8 sockets that connect, take one chunk
#: and then stop reading pin every permit (and descriptor) for as long as they
#: stay connected, and every app UI on the host stops loading. The default
#: matches `_BLOB_FETCH_TIMEOUT` in this file — 30s is the ceiling this
#: module treats as a dead peer — and it is ~100x the budget a real transfer
#: needs: `_UI_MAX_BYTES` is 8 MiB, so even the largest servable file finishes
#: inside it at ~280 KB/s, over a loopback connection to the dashboard. Expiry

    only shape without that window; everything after it reads the fd, which
