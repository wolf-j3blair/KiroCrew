"""Hook reconciler — reload app backend hooks when the CLI mutates them out-of-process.

The problem this solves
-----------------------
An app's ``backend.hooks`` (``on_startup``, ``on_shutdown``, ``routes``) run
*inside the gateway process*. The gateway loads them once — at boot
(:func:`kiro_crew.apps.hooks_integration.on_gateway_startup`) and on the
dashboard enable/disable HTTP handlers — and thereafter serves whatever module
object is cached in ``sys.modules`` under the app's ``_kirocrew_app_<name>.*``
namespace.

The CLI ``kirocrew app {enable,disable,install,uninstall}`` subcommands are a
DIFFERENT process. They mutate the app on disk directly — flipping
``installed.json``, moving files, rotating ``.app_secret`` — and never call the
gateway. So after a CLI reinstall the running gateway keeps executing the OLD
module, the old ``on_startup`` background task keeps running, and its calls
start failing auth because ``.app_secret`` rotated underneath it. Only a full
``kirocrew restart`` picked up the change, and nothing said so.

This is the same class of gap the CLI already closes for CRON jobs (it writes
``crons.json`` and the gateway's timer tick re-syncs by content digest) and for
UI assets (the dev-mode watcher live-reloads ``ui/``). Python hooks had no such
reconciler. This module is it, modelled on :mod:`kiro_crew.apps.dev_mode`'s
singleton poll watcher.

One source of truth, no shadow bookkeeping
------------------------------------------
The set of "which apps have hooks loaded, under what on-disk signature" lives in
:mod:`kiro_crew.apps.hooks_integration` (``record_loaded_hook_signature`` /
``clear_loaded_hook_signature`` / ``loaded_hook_signature``), and EVERY driver
of the lifecycle updates it: the dashboard enable/disable handlers, the boot
startup pass, and this reconciler. That shared record is what keeps the
reconciler from fighting the in-process handlers — a dashboard-driven enable
records the new signature itself, so the reconciler sees no drift and does NOT
re-run the app's ``on_startup`` on its next tick (and symmetrically a dashboard
disable clears the record, so the reconciler does not re-run ``on_shutdown``
after teardown already reported clean). The reconciler only acts on a genuine
divergence between disk and that shared loaded-state.

How it works
------------
A single gateway-side task polls installed apps on an interval. For each app it
asks ``hook_signature(app_info)`` for the current on-disk identity and compares
to the shared loaded-signature. Three transitions drive the existing in-process
lifecycle, so no new teardown/reimport logic is invented here:

* loaded, now **disabled or gone**          -> :func:`on_app_disable`
  (runs ``on_shutdown`` when resolvable, deregisters routes, ``unload_app_modules``).
* loaded, **code or secret changed**         -> ``on_app_disable`` then
  :func:`on_app_enable` (full evict + reimport under the new secret).
* not loaded, now **enabled with hooks**      -> :func:`on_app_enable`.

``on_app_disable`` refuses to tear down while a timed-out ``on_startup`` task is
still owned (it clears the loaded-signature only past that guard), so the
reconciler observes the record still present and simply retries next tick.

#: Poll cadence. Hooks change far less often than UI files (dev_mode polls at
#: 1s), and each tick walks every installed app's manifest via ``list_apps``, so
#: this is deliberately slow: a CLI reinstall going live within ~15s is the goal,
#: not sub-second latency. The interval is the lever that keeps the always-on
#: cost of that walk small on a gateway that rarely changes apps (dev_mode avoids
#: the walk with a sentinel because it polls every 1s; at this cadence the walk
#: is cheap enough not to warrant that machinery, and honesty about the cost is
#: in the interval rather than a claim that no walk happens).
POLL_INTERVAL_SECS = 15.0

#: own lifecycle lock prevents a double-entry next tick); we only stop *waiting*
#: on it so the pass returns and the loop keeps polling. Generously larger than a
#: normal teardown so it only trips on a genuine hang.

#: Total wall-clock budget for the shutdown-time drain (the in-flight-pass wait +

#: reconcile here must NOT starve the backend shutdown sweep -- if the drain does
#: not settle within this bound we stop waiting and let shutdown proceed (the
#: straggler is not cancelled; process exit reclaims it). Kept well under the
#: ~10s ``_hooks_shutdown`` budget.
SHUTDOWN_DRAIN_BUDGET_SECS = 5.0

#: Set once ``stop_hook_reconciler`` begins the shutdown sweep. A watchdog can
#: leave a per-app reconcile task running past the pass that spawned it; without

#: AFTER ``on_gateway_shutdown`` has torn everything down (surviving an in-process
#: restart). Every ``_reconcile_app`` re-checks this under the app's lifecycle
#: lock immediately before doing any enable/teardown and bails if set, so no app
