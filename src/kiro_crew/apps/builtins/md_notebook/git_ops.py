"""Git operations for the Notes builtin: clone, attach, status, commit, sync.

Ported from the app's ``@md-notebook/core-git`` package, which was built on
isomorphic-git (a pure-JS git implementation). This version drives the real
``git`` binary instead, which removes two whole layers the JS needed:

* its ``localTransport`` module existed only because isomorphic-git's HTTP
  client cannot speak ``file://`` remotes — real git handles local remotes
  natively, so local and remote vaults follow one code path here;
* its auth plumbing wrapped a PAT into an ``onAuth`` callback — here a token is
  passed through ``GIT_CONFIG_*`` environment variables, which apply to a
  single invocation and are never written into the repository's config.

Credential handling: the token is sent as an ``Authorization`` header supplied
through the environment. It is never interpolated into a URL (which would
persist it in ``.git/config`` and leak it into any error message that echoes
the remote) and never passed as a command-line argument (which would expose it
in the process table).

    On a merge conflict NOTHING is overwritten: the merge is aborted so the

    conflicted path with both the local and remote versions for the UI to
    present.

    ``local_only`` is a vault attached from a repo with no remote: the run stops
    after the commit — there is nothing to fetch, merge or push.

    ``commit_only`` stops after the commit for ANY vault. It backs the periodic
    autosave, so it deliberately skips the remote-identity checks: nothing it
    does can reach a remote, and a vault whose remote drifted must still get its
    edits into local history rather than silently stop saving.

    ``notes_only`` selects what the commit stages. ``None`` (the default) ties it
    to ``commit_only`` — the historical behaviour where a user-initiated Sync
    stages the whole scope and only an autosave stages notes alone. Passing it
    explicitly decouples the two: the background auto-sync loop pushes (so
    ``commit_only`` is False) yet must stage notes ONLY, because a timer — not the
    user — chose the moment, and a stray non-note file dropped in the vault must
    not enter history and then the remote without the user deciding to send it.
