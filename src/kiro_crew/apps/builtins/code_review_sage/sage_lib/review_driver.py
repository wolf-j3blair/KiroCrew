"""Review driver — code-enforced two-stage review loop.

Neither the clean-session-per-change guarantee NOR the Phase 1 -> Phase 2 switch
is left to the LLM. This deterministic driver owns both:

  Stage 1 (gate)  — spawn an isolated Phase-1-ONLY session per change; it writes
                    a gate-only result record (phase1 + blast_radius).
  Phase switch    — the driver READS the recorded gate_verdict. Every usable
                    verdict (PASS, CONCERNS, BLOCK) proceeds to Phase 2: a design
                    BLOCK informs the ship decision but does NOT skip the code
                    review, so the author sees all issues in one pass.
  Stage 2 (deep)  — for any usable verdict: spawn a second isolated session that
                    runs the Phase 2 dimensions and augments the record with
                    findings.

Both stages run on a **reusable worker pool** (``sage_lib/review_pool.py``): a bounded
set of long-lived ``AcpClient`` sessions, NOT a fresh ``/api/spawn`` sub-agent
per change. The driver hands each task to the pool via an injected ``dispatch``
callable and the call returns when that task's session finishes its turn (i.e.
the result record is on disk) — so there is no done-flag polling, no lingering
worker, and no reaper. Because pool workers are direct ACP sessions they bypass
the SubagentManager entirely: no agent card, no ``:lock:`` approval prompt, no
Slack relay — the review runs silently. Each reused worker is reset to a clean
conversation between CRs so reviews never cross-contaminate.

The driver then builds the Focus Report deterministically. The orchestrating
session cannot review inline because the driver owns the dispatch. The per-change
*judgment* (the gate verdict and the findings) still runs in each isolated worker
session using the code-review-sage ruleset — Python enforces the structure and
the phase switch, not the verdict itself.

    The prompts hand a session on some host shell a command line, so they have to

    python.org installer nor ``python -m venv`` creates a ``python3.exe`` on
    Windows, where the name instead resolves to a Microsoft Store app-execution
    alias that runs no Python — the command then produces no result record and
    the review yields nothing while looking like it ran. ``sys.executable`` is an
    absolute path to a real interpreter on every platform, so it satisfies that.

    This returns the path RAW, and deliberately does no shell quoting. Quoting
    requires knowing the worker's shell, which is not pinned: on Windows the
    session may get PowerShell or cmd, and the two disagree — a quoted path is a
    string literal needing PowerShell's call operator in one and a syntax error
    with that operator in the other. Since a Windows profile with a space in it
    (``C:\\Users\\First Last\\...``) is ordinary rather than exceptional, guessing
    wrong would restore the same silent no-result failure for a large share of
    Windows users. The worker knows its own shell, so the prompt tells it to
    quote as that shell requires.
    Deliberately NOT the shared ``resolve_app_python(app_root)`` policy, which
    prefers ``<app_root>/.venv``'s interpreter. ``store.app_root()`` resolves under
    ``KIROCREW_HOME`` -- the same writable tree the review worker itself writes into,
    and that worker is prompt-injectable. A worker that planted an executable at
    ``.venv/Scripts/python.exe`` would have the NEXT review execute it: arbitrary
    code execution as the gateway plus forged result records, and persistence into
    a later run rather than a capability it already had. So the interpreter is taken
    from the process the prompt is built IN, never from a path the worker can write.

    Nothing is given up by declining the venv preference here. That preference
    exists so an app's own dependencies are importable, and this app has no
    ``requirements.txt``; the only non-stdlib import anywhere in ``sage_lib`` is
    ``kiro_crew`` itself, which is importable under ``sys.executable`` by
    construction because that is the interpreter running the gateway. An app venv
    would in fact be the weaker choice: it need not have ``kiro_crew`` installed

    The id, not a boolean, because "which draft did we confirm" is the fact callers
    need: the poster replaces a stale draft by DELETING and re-creating it, so a later
    run's draft always has a different id. Recording the id is what lets a view prove
    the draft pending right now is the one ITS run delivered, rather than one a
    subsequent run put there.

    Delivery evidence must not come from the process that claims to have delivered.
    The poster is an LLM session that writes its own `posted_comments`, so this reads
    the pull request's PENDING reviews back through the app's own `gh api` chokepoint
    and compares what is there against the payload that was sent.

    Comparing on CONTENT rather than a unit count is what makes the read-back mean
    anything. A count alone is satisfied by any draft of the right size, including a
    previous run's draft that the poster never replaced: the obsolete findings would
    be marked delivered, the pull request indexed as reviewed, the retryable records
    cleared, and the stale draft is what the publish button then offers. So all three
    identifying parts must match -- the body, the anchoring commit, and every inline
    comment with its own anchor -- because a review is only the same review if it
    says the same things about the same lines of the same revision.

    All-or-nothing is faithful here rather than a simplification: the draft is
    created by ONE POST carrying every inline comment, so a partially-delivered
    review is not a state GitHub can be left in -- the call either creates the whole
    thing or fails.

    Returns "" on any doubt -- no draft, different content, a non-GitHub platform,
    a `gh` failure, a timeout. "" means "not proven delivered", which leaves the
    durable ledger untouched and lets the next post re-send.

    Phase-2 deep-review task for every usable verdict (PASS / CONCERNS / BLOCK).
    Each task is dispatched to the reusable worker pool (``dispatch``) and the
    call returns when that task's session finishes its turn. The driver reads
    the gate verdict; a BLOCK does not skip Phase 2 (it only informs the ship
    decision), then builds the Focus Report. Returns a deterministic summary.

    ``dispatch`` is an injected ``(task, timeout) -> {ok, output, error}`` callable
    (the app backend wires ``review_pool.make_sync_dispatch``; tests inject a fake).
    ``concurrency`` <= 0 means auto: default to the worker pool's concurrency
    cap (``review_pool.MAX_CONCURRENT``).

    ``run_id`` scopes this run's result records and report to
    ``data/runs/<run_id>/`` instead of the shared dirs, which is what makes it safe
    for several runs to be in flight at once. Omitting it keeps the legacy shared
    layout (standalone CLI use).

    ``cancelled`` is an optional zero-arg predicate polled between changes. When it
    turns true, changes that have not started are skipped and reported as
    ``cancelled``. A change already mid-dispatch runs to completion — the worker
    session owns an in-flight model turn that cannot be torn down mid-stream
    without corrupting the pool — so cancellation is prompt but not instant.

    ``post`` overrides the ``review.auto_post`` config for this run: findings are
    published back to the pull request as a PENDING (draft) review only when it is
    enabled. It defaults to OFF, because the review is meant to be READ in the
    app, and writing to a pull request is a side effect the user asks for rather
    than a consequence of running a review.

    The durable dedup index (``_record_reviewed``) and the run verdict
    (``_all_delivered``) both decide "was this actually delivered?" by reading
    exactly these four fields off the per-change record. Every path that delivers
    comments must therefore write them the SAME way, or the two readers disagree
    with reality: an explicit retry that succeeded but left the record showing the
    original failure keeps the PR out of the index, and the next repo review
    re-reviews and re-posts it.

    ``posting_expected`` comes from the payload units the poster was actually asked
    to deliver (``expected_units``), never from a finding count -- an unanchored
    finding folds into the review body instead of becoming its own inline comment.

    ``posted_keys`` names WHICH findings landed, which is what the UI needs rather
    than a count: it marks individual findings as sent, and it is the evidence the
    publish action requires before releasing the pending review. Omitting it here
    left the auto-post path delivering a draft the app then refused to publish,
    because the run carried no record of which change the draft belonged to.

    ``posted_review_id`` names WHICH DRAFT carries them. A later run replaces the
    draft by deleting and re-creating it, so without the id an earlier run's view
    cannot tell its own draft from that replacement -- and the publish action, which
    compares the two, has nothing to compare against.
