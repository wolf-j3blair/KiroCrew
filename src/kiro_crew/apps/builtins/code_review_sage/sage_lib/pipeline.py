    Deterministic backbone (no LLM): runs ``gh api`` with a LIST argv (never

    ``adapters.parse_repo_ref`` before this is called and are interpolated only
    into the ``gh api`` PATH argument (which `gh` treats as an API path, not a
    shell command), so there is no shell-injection surface. ``host`` has passed
    the same parsed-hostname allowlist; a non-github.com (GitHub Enterprise)

    missing, unauthenticated, times out, or the repo can't be read.

    ``labels`` is the PR's label NAMES. It costs no extra request: the REST list
    payload this already asks for carries ``.labels`` inline, so the names are
    projected out of the response in hand rather than fetched per PR or read from

    ``[]``, never a missing key, so a caller can narrow on it without a
