"""Code Review Sage — app-local store + self-heal data layout.

This module is the deterministic, token-free backbone of the app. It owns the
on-disk layout under ``<config_dir>/apps/code-review-sage/data/`` (i.e.
``~/.kiro/crew/apps/code-review-sage/data/`` by default) and is safe to run on
every action (idempotent self-heal).

    name and a link there is followed silently and then pinned.

    The walk opens components by name, so which names it gets decides what it can

    Every writer in this app stages a private temp file beside its target and
    renames over the name, which stops a symlink planted AT that name from being
    followed. What it did not stop is a swapped ANCESTOR: ``mkstemp(dir=...)``
    resolves the parent by name, then ``os.replace(tmp, path)`` resolves it twice
    more, so a reviewer worker -- which runs prompt-injected model output and has
    a shell inside its own run tree -- could swap a directory for a symlink
    between those resolutions and redirect the write outside the sandbox. The
    content is gateway-derived, so the primitive is a fixed-content clobber
    rather than injection, but it lets the sandboxed side make the unsandboxed
    gateway write where the sandbox refused.

    Pinning collapses those three resolutions into one: the parent is opened as a
    descriptor and the create, the rename and any cleanup are all relative to
    that inode, so a swap AFTER the pin cannot redirect them -- it renames a
    directory the descriptor does not name. ``O_NOFOLLOW`` on the pin also
    refuses a parent that is itself a link.

    The ANCESTOR CHAIN is covered in two halves, because neither half covers the
    other. ``mkdir(parents=True)`` and a single ``os.open`` both resolve the full
    path by name and ``O_NOFOLLOW`` guards only the final component, so an
    INTERMEDIATE ancestor that is a link is followed. :func:`refuse_linked_parents`
    refuses a link that is ALREADY on the chain -- the shape that can be planted
    at leisure -- and :func:`pin_record_dir` then walks the chain one
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` ``openat`` per component, so a component swapped AFTER that
    refusal is refused rather than followed. The pin cannot replace the refusal:
    it starts from the trust anchor and takes the anchor's own resolution on
    trust, which is where a link is the operator's layout and must keep working.
    The refusal cannot replace the pin, because an ``lstat`` loses a race with a
    link planted just after it.

    Inside the owned trees that race is closed here, and the closing is a matter
    of which NAMES the walk is handed: the names below the anchor stay lexical
    (see :func:`pin_record_dir`), so nothing between the refusal and the walk
    re-resolves them and a link planted in that window fails its own open. Two
    cases keep the older, weaker story. A swap at or ABOVE the anchor is followed
    by the anchor's resolution, which is deliberate. And a parent outside every
    owned root has no anchor, so its chain is resolved whole -- caller-supplied
    roots and temp trees, where a link cannot be told from layout anyway.
    Creating the chain is still the weaker step either way: see
    :func:`mkdir_refusing_links`, whose own window needs a chain-CREATING pinned
    descent the runtime does not offer yet.

    Owner-only comes from the ``0o600`` creation mode instead of a follow-up
    ``restrict_to_owner`` call, which would be another resolution by name. On the
    fallback path (Windows: :data:`_CAN_PIN_DIR` is False because none of the
    dir_fd variants exist there) the write itself is exactly today's
    :func:`open_locked_temp` + ``os.replace``, DACL lockdown included -- the
    platform that cannot pin is the platform that keeps the old shape. It is not
    left bare, though: the refusal above runs on every platform, and its ``lstat``
    walk is the only check that sees a Windows JUNCTION at all, which
    ``os.path.islink`` reports as False.
    Callers own creating the parent, and every one of the nine does -- either
    `mkdir(parents=True)` directly (`learning`, `report`, `followup`) or
    `ensure_layout` / `ensure_run_layout` (`discovery`, `results`). This function
    deliberately does NOT create it: an `exist_ok` mkdir here RESURRECTS a
    directory tree that a concurrent namespace deletion is removing, so the
    delete reports success while a stale record survives under a namespace that
    is supposed to be gone. Dropping it also removes the last by-name `mkdir`
    from this path, leaving the pin as the only place the parent is resolved.

    Callers ALSO own mutual exclusion, which the ``locked`` in the name does not
    supply: it names the owner-only lockdown of the bytes, not a lock against
    another writer. One publish is all-or-nothing, and two publishes aimed at one
    name are two renames the primitive knows nothing about. On POSIX they are
    harmless, so the gap is invisible there; on Windows ``os.replace`` raises
    ``PermissionError`` when a handle is open on the destination or another
    rename is landing on it, and the loser's whole action fails. So a caller that
    can publish one target from several processes serializes itself:
    :func:`layout_lock` covers the self-heal's seeds and
    ``learning._candidate_lock`` covers the candidate catalog, both through the
    runtime's advisory file lock.

    made safe AROUND the append instead of by replacing it.

    Three legs, mirroring the runtime's own no-follow publish, and the middle one
    is the portable half:

    * the ancestor chain goes through :func:`refuse_linked_parents`, which is the
      shape an attacker can stage at leisure and the only check that sees a
      Windows junction;
    * the leaf is ``lstat``-ed by :func:`_refuse_unsafe_leaf` and refused when it
      is a link or not a regular file. The check runs on every platform, but it is
      only welded to the open where ``O_NOFOLLOW`` exists -- see the residual
      below;
    * where the dir_fd verbs exist the leaf is opened RELATIVE to the pinned
      parent, so no ancestor is re-resolved by name between the refusal and the
      open, and a component swapped in that window fails its own open.

    Then the OPENED descriptor is checked by :func:`_refuse_unsafe_fd`, which is
    the only leg that sees a hardlink -- an alias to another inode passes every
    name test above, and on a descriptor the check cannot be raced.

    RESIDUAL, Windows only. Where the dir_fd verbs are absent the open stays by
    name, and ``getattr(os, "O_NOFOLLOW", 0)`` is 0 there, so that open FOLLOWS a
    reparse point at the leaf. What degrades is therefore more than ancestor
    pinning: the leaf refusal above becomes a check-to-open window, and neither
    remaining leg closes it. ``_refuse_unsafe_fd`` cannot, because a followed
    reparse point yields a descriptor on the TARGET, and a regular target with one
    link passes both of its tests. So a reparse point planted in that window sends
    the append into the file it names. :func:`platform_compat.open_file_no_reparse`
    is the mechanism that settles a leaf and opens it in one operation, but it
    opens for READING; there is no write- or append-capable counterpart, and an

    :func:`ensure_layout` is a read-modify-write: it tests whether a seeded file
    is present and publishes it when it is not. Every entry point runs it, and
    reviews run as separate PROCESSES, so several of them can each observe one
    absent seed and each publish it. On POSIX the duplicate publishes are
    harmless -- ``rename`` is atomic and the content is identical -- but on
    Windows ``os.replace`` fails with ``PermissionError`` when another process
    holds a handle on the destination or is renaming onto it at that moment, so
    the loser of the race raises out of :func:`atomic_write_locked` and its whole
    action fails. Measured on one fresh root with six concurrent entrants: all
    six published ``learned-patterns.md``, five published ``reports/index.json``.

    An advisory file lock is the exclusion the publish itself cannot supply: the
    rename is atomic, which makes a single publish all-or-nothing, and says
    nothing about two of them meeting on one name. Holding it across the test AND
    the publish is what collapses the six publishes into one, and holding it
    across ``_seed_config``'s read too is what keeps a reader's handle off a
    destination another entrant is replacing.

    The lock file is opened the way every other leaf this module opens by name
    is, through the same four legs and the same helpers rather than a second
    spelling of them. :func:`refuse_linked_parents` refuses a link ALREADY sitting
    on the chain above it. :func:`pin_record_dir` then walks that chain one
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` ``openat`` per component and the leaf is opened relative to the
    resulting descriptor, so a component swapped AFTER the refusal fails its own
    open rather than redirecting this one: ``O_NOFOLLOW`` on a by-name open guards
    the FINAL component only, so without the pin a ``data`` directory swapped for
    a link would place this file wherever the link points, and the review worker
    that can plant the link is exactly who the sandbox is meant to confine.
    :func:`_refuse_unsafe_leaf` refuses a link or a non-regular file already at
    the name, on every platform, since that needs no race at all; and
    :func:`_refuse_unsafe_fd` rejects a hardlink to another inode on the open
    descriptor -- which cannot be raced -- since that passes ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and
    the name checks alike. No ``O_TRUNC``, because a lock's contents are
    irrelevant. Mode ``0o600`` keeps it owner-only from creation, matching the
    data it guards.

    RESIDUAL, Windows only, and it is the same one :func:`open_append_nolink`
    carries: the dir_fd verbs do not exist there, so the leaf is opened by name
    and the chain above it rests on the ``lstat`` refusal alone, which an
    attacker can outrun by planting a link after it. ``getattr(os, "O_NOFOLLOW",
    0)`` is also 0 there, so the leaf refusal becomes a check-to-open window and
    a reparse point planted inside it sends this open to whatever it names; the
    ``fstat`` cannot carry that one, because a followed reparse point yields a
    descriptor on a target that is itself a lone regular file. What the platform
    does get is the whole of the exclusion this function exists for -- the
    advisory lock is ``msvcrt.locking`` there and serializes the seeding exactly
    as ``flock`` does -- so the concurrency gap closes on Windows while the chain
    story stays at the module's existing Windows floor rather than improving.
