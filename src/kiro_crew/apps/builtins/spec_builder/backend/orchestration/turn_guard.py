One ``asyncio.Lock`` per canonical spec directory serializes every Spec Builder

    ``None`` is an alias whose persisted slot identity is not ownership-valid.
    Such an alias is occupied: its worker may still be running under the
    per-creation key that the agent-writable index does not reveal.

    BLOCKING -- call via ``asyncio.to_thread`` (``_alias_slots`` is the only caller). It
    reads the index and resolves each entry's directory, both filesystem work, which is
    exactly why it does not belong on the loop.

    Excludes the caller's own slot: that one is the same session, where an ordinary
    message is legitimately QUEUED rather than refused. Another name is a different
    session over the same documents, so a turn running under it is a concurrent editor.

    Each alias's key is RESOLVED, never read raw from its entry. index.json is
    agent-writable, so ``meta["slot_key"]`` is attacker-controlled, and trusting it gave
    an alias two ways to make itself invisible to the busy scan: delete the field and the
    entry was skipped for having no key, or copy the caller's key and it was skipped as
    "our own slot". Either way a live concurrent editor read as absent and both agents
    wrote the same spec files. ``_slot_key`` answers from the ownership-validated map
    instead -- a key only survives ``_owns_slot_key`` if it structurally encodes its own
    indexed name -- and falls back to the name-derived form otherwise, which is the same
    key ``_ensure_worker_slot`` would have run that alias under. That fallback is only
    authoritative for a legacy entry, though: if a per-creation key was removed while
    its worker was active, the fallback names a DIFFERENT slot. An ownership-invalid
    entry therefore refuses dispatch instead of guessing which worker owns the files.

    Resolution happens HERE, once and off the loop, rather than in ``_busy_alias``: that
    one runs on the event loop, and one validated resolution per alias is also cheaper
    than re-deriving keys per question asked.
