"""One source of truth for hardening HOST-SIDE git over an agent-writable tree.

## The threat

The improvement agent runs sandboxed, but this app's OWN git commands run on the HOST as
the gateway user, in the very worktree/clone the agent edits. Git is configurable BY THE
REPOSITORY, and several of those settings name a PROGRAM git then executes:

  * ``core.hooksPath`` + a hook file — runs on ``commit``/``push``/``checkout``.
  * ``hook.<name>.command`` + ``hook.<name>.event`` (git 2.54+) — a hook defined in
    config, which ``core.hooksPath`` does not reach.
  * ``core.fsmonitor`` — a program git spawns to enumerate changes (``status``/``diff``).
  * ``filter.<name>.clean`` / ``.smudge`` — bound by ``.gitattributes``, run by ``add``
    and ``checkout``.
  * ``diff.<name>.textconv`` / ``.command`` — bound by ``.gitattributes``, run by ``diff``.

An agent with the auto-approved shell can write both halves (``git config …`` writes
repo-local ``.git/config``; a ``.gitattributes`` is just a file), so any host-side git call
afterwards executes agent-chosen code OUTSIDE the sandbox with the operator's credentials.

## Why two mechanisms, not one

Measured against a real repo (git 2.47):

  * ``-c core.hooksPath=<devnull> -c core.fsmonitor=false`` blocks hooks and fsmonitor but
    NOT a clean filter — a planted ``filter.pwn.clean`` still executed on ``git add``.
  * ``-c core.attributesFile=<devnull>`` does NOT help: an IN-TREE ``.gitattributes`` still
    binds the driver.
  * ``GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL/SYSTEM=<devnull>`` does NOT help: the driver lives in repo-local
    ``.git/config``, which those do not suppress.
  * ``.git/info/attributes`` DOES block it — that file outranks the in-tree
    ``.gitattributes``, and clearing the binding unbinds a driver without needing its name.
  * For a LINKED WORKTREE git reads ``info/attributes`` from the COMMON gitdir, NOT the
    per-worktree ``.git/worktrees/<id>/info`` — measured on git 2.47: a pin in the
    per-worktree copy leaves the in-tree ``.gitattributes`` filter BOUND, while the same pin
    in the common ``info`` unsets it. Candidates run in ``git worktree``s, so pinning the
    common dir (see :func:`_common_gitdir`) is what actually defends the hot path.

So the flags close the config-named vectors and the attributes pin closes the
attribute-bound ones. Both are required; neither is sufficient alone.

## Why the pin is ``* -filter diff`` and NOT ``* -filter -diff -text``

The first version of this pin used ``-diff``, which was WRONG in a way the suite caught:
``-diff`` marks every path BINARY, so ``git diff`` prints "Binary files a/f.txt and b/f.txt
differ" instead of content — and this app has a credential scanner
(``pr_recipe._scan_pushable_content``) that reads a diff to find secrets before a push. The
pin would have silently blinded a security control while appearing to harden one.

``diff`` SET (not unset) is the fix: it forces git's BUILT-IN textual differ, which unbinds
any ``diff=<driver>`` (so no ``textconv``/external command runs) while leaving the diff
readable. Verified both ways — a planted ``diff.pwn.textconv`` does not execute, and a
credential added to a tracked file is still visible in ``git diff``. ``-text`` is dropped
for the same reason: EOL conversion is not an execution vector on its own.

## Why the pin is rewritten every time

``.git/info/attributes`` is inside the tree the agent can write, and an agent that wipes it
re-opens the hole (measured: wiping it let the filter execute again). :func:`git_argv`
therefore re-pins immediately before handing back an argv, so the file is correct at the
moment of the call rather than merely at setup time.

Deliberately ONE module rather than a constant copied per call site: this same class of
finding has now been reported against six different helpers, each time because a new
host-side git surface did not carry the hardening. A single ``git_argv`` is the only shape
where adding a call site cannot silently omit it.
