This is the front door of a run: the user names a repository here, and the

Ported from the upstream module, GitHub-only: the internal-host allowlist entry,
the internal SSH URL construction, and the CloudFarm code path are removed. Only
`github.com` is accepted, and the clone URL is rebuilt from validated

#: it -- the marker is written and read host-side by this module -- so HIDDEN is the right

#: the mount with it. At the top level the only ancestors are the data home and ``$HOME``,

    can only bind over a name that exists. The ``mkdir`` here therefore matters only where

    The root itself must be a REAL directory: a link planted at the root would put every

    renaming the tree aside is the primary guard and needs no marker, because a clone renamed
    away from its canonical name is not found and not reused. The marker covers the window
    that guard cannot: the caller persists it first, so a process that dies between the two
    steps, or a rename that fails outright, still leaves a durable refusal behind rather than a
    poisoned tree sitting at the name the next run looks up. A marker whose clone is retired or
    removed clears itself, which is what the next paragraph is about.

    WHEN IT CLEARS is the question a persisted latch has to answer, and this one answers it
    structurally rather than on a timer or an event: the marker names a specific DIRECTORY, so
    :func:`_clone_is_quarantined` reports it only while that directory still exists. A later
    successful retirement, or an operator removing the tree, therefore clears the guard as a
    side effect of removing the thing it guards -- there is no state where the bytes are gone
    and the refusal outlives them, and none where the bytes are present and the refusal has
    expired.

    ``O_EXCL``, NEVER ``O_TRUNC``: this open must not be able to shorten an existing file, so
    the truncating flag is simply not in the set. An existing ENTRY at the marker name is then
    not a failure but the guard already standing, and it is reported as such.

    THE TWO SIDES MUST AGREE ON WHAT "PRESENT" MEANS, which is why the reader below uses
    ``lstat`` and not ``exists``. A DANGLING SYMLINK is an existing entry to this open --
    ``O_CREAT|O_EXCL`` refuses it -- and an absent file to ``exists``. Split that way, a
    planted dangling link would make marking report success while the guard read no marker at
    all. Raised by the GPT review of this branch.

    Best-effort by construction: if even this write fails there is nothing further to try, and
    the caller logs that the clone is unsafe in place.
