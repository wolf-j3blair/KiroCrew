"""Pod lifecycle for an agent session, served by the GATEWAY process.

WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL
----------------------
An agent session runs behind a sandbox with its own user namespace. Its shells
therefore cannot ``connect(2)`` the systemd user-bus socket, and every pod verb
needs that bus: ``kirocrew pod up`` runs ``systemctl --user daemon-reload`` plus
``start``, which fails with a bare ``Permission denied``. Pod-based testing is
the QA loop for Kiro Crew development, so losing it from agent sessions means a
human has to boot each pod by hand and paste a ``{base_url, token}`` handle into
the session.

The gateway process has no such wall: it is the process the sandbox launcher is a
CHILD of, so it holds the host namespace and the host bus. These routes are the
gateway doing the systemd part on the agent's behalf. The agent reaches them the
way it reaches every other tool -- an MCP call over the stdio pipe, then loopback
HTTP to the gateway -- and no D-Bus passthrough into the sandbox is needed.

WHY THESE ROUTES AND NOT THE APP BACKEND'S EXISTING ONES
--------------------------------------------------------
Dev Fleet already serves ``/api/pod/up`` and friends from its backend subprocess,
reached through the gateway's ``/apps/dev-fleet/api/*`` reverse proxy. That proxy
is browser-shaped: it requires a dashboard session cookie or token, and the agent
holds neither (cookies are httpOnly, ``KIROCREW_INTERNAL_SECRET`` is stripped from
agent env, and ``.local_secret`` is on the sensitive-path denylist). Admitting an
internal-secret caller to that proxy would have opened the app's WHOLE backend
surface to anything holding the secret, so instead these four routes are named
one by one in ``server._STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS`` -- the same shape
``/api/apps/issue-radar/investigation`` and the Ops Mission Control agent surface
already use, and for the same reason.

The pod work itself is NOT reimplemented here. Every handler delegates to the
``worktree_ops`` helpers the dashboard's own buttons call, which shell out to
``kirocrew pod ... --json``. One definition of what "up" means, one definition of
what a pod's status is, and an agent and a human clicking the same operation get
the same result.

WHAT GATES IT
-------------
``dev-fleet`` ships ``defaultEnabled: false``, and every handler is wrapped in
:func:`_require_enabled`. Routes are registered once at gateway startup, before any
app is known to be on, so without that wrapper an app the operator never turned on
would still be callable. Each handler additionally re-asserts that the caller is a
local process holding the internal secret (:func:`_machine_only`).

There is deliberately NO per-operator opt-in on top of that, and no per-call
approval. A pod runs the code in a git worktree an agent can write, started by the
user systemd manager, so it executes outside the agent's sandbox -- but that
reachability is Kiro Crew's DOCUMENTED posture, not something this module invents:
``docs/system-specs/modules/security.md``, under "Scoped user-bus locator forward",
records that sandboxed agent shells legitimately run ``systemctl --user`` and the
``kirocrew pod`` CLI, and names the residual in the same paragraph. The builtin
``pod-e2e`` skill has always instructed agents to boot pods. An extra gate here
would not close that residual; it would only stop the agent-driven QA loop this
module exists to restore, while leaving every other path to the same reachability
open. Agent pod control is an intended capability, so it is not gated.
