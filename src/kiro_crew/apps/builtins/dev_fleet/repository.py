    ``_make_live`` validates its target against the discovered worktree set and the

    while nothing is resolved, so a user who answers the setup card stops seeing that
    card without restarting the gateway. Single-flight, so several concurrent first
    requests run discovery once between them rather than racing the globals below.

    Latched only once a checkout RESOLVED. An unresolved process has no answer worth
    keeping — there is no fleet to serve, and the answer changes the moment the
    operator writes ``dev_fleet.repo_path`` — so trying again is the point. Only that
    half self-heals: ``_load_dev_fleet_cfg`` re-reads ``config.json`` on every call,

    That is what makes a second attempt safe to run at all: the shape to avoid is a
    later attempt assigning ``MAIN_REPO`` while an earlier attempt's validation
    verdict survives beside it, because then ``_repo()`` hands out a path whose
    markers were never checked — and ``worktree remove``, ``update-ref -d``,
    ``pull --ff-only`` and ``pip install -e`` run inside whatever that is.

    Discovery runs on a local so the global is written exactly once per attempt —
    this keeps the function out of the ``MAIN_REPO`` AST ratchet's allowlist: nothing

    subtly different, and there is one sentence to change.

    Called with no arguments it reads the module globals (the caption path). The

    the walk began. ``realpath`` is deliberately NOT used first: resolution
    follows the topology as it stands NOW, so it resolves INTO a swapped ancestor
    and lands the deletion in the attacker's target -- tried and verified to
    destroy an external file, which is laundering the swap rather than refusing
    it. The price is that a worktree path containing a legitimately symlinked
    ancestor is refused; that is the same trade as the platform check below.
    Where these primitives do not exist (Windows has no ``openat``/``O_NOFOLLOW``)
    the discard is REFUSED rather than downgraded to a path-based unlink, since a
    junction swapped into an ancestor is not even reported as a link by
    ``os.path.islink``. Empty directories are left behind on purpose -- git does
    not track them, ``status``/``ls-files`` do not report them, and ``git worktree
    remove`` does not object to them (verified), so removing them would be scope
    this consent does not cover.
