# overrides every config file) so EVERY git invocation from this handler —
# foreground inspection, the unattended background fetch, rebase, sync pull,
# and any git a build step runs — is neutralized at one chokepoint instead of
# per-call-site flags. The config keys are attacker-configurable via an
# agent-writable ``.git/config`` and would otherwise execute code:
#   * protocol pin  — ``ext::``/custom remote helpers refused by git itself
#   * core.fsmonitor / core.hooksPath — repo-registered executables
#   * credential.helper (reset to empty list) — helper commands
#   * core.sshCommand (pinned to plain ``ssh``) — arbitrary command on fetch
#
# GIT_NO_REPLACE_OBJECTS is the odd one out: not a config key and not about code
# execution, but about WHICH OBJECT GRAPH git answers from. A
# ``refs/replace/<oid>`` ref substitutes one object for another in every read, so
# ``log``, ``rev-list --count``, ``merge-base`` and ``merge --ff-only`` all answer
# about the SUBSTITUTE graph — a history no checked-out commit names. Every git
# answer this handler acts on is a statement about the checkout on disk, so the
# real graph is the only one that answers the question asked. Grafting is a
# legitimate local operation (``git replace``), so this is a correctness pin
# first and a tamper pin second, and it is an env var rather than a config pair
# so no config precedence applies to it at all. ``update_governance`` and
# ``auto_improvement``'s clone setup already pin it for the same reason.
#
# GIT_OPTIONAL_LOCKS is the other non-config pin, and it is about WHAT GIT WRITES
# on a read. ``git status`` refreshes the index's stat cache and saves it back,
# taking ``index.lock`` to do so, which makes a command that is a read to its
# caller a WRITE to the repository. Every fleet render runs one per row, so the
# fleet contends with the operator's own git for the lock on the ordinary path.
# Set to ``0`` here rather than as a ``--no-optional-locks`` flag per call site so
# the argv this handler builds stays the subcommand it names, and so a read added
# later inherits it. Nothing this handler needs is lost: the porcelain answer is
# identical, and a real mutation still takes the locks it REQUIRES.

    """Allowlisted base environment for build/CLI subprocesses.

    ``_GIT_ENV_NEUTRALIZERS`` pins git transports to https/ssh and
    neutralizes repo-controlled execution config (fsmonitor/hooks/credential
    helper/sshCommand) for the sync ``git pull`` and any git a build step
    runs. Harmless for pip/npm.

    Operator credential helpers are injected ONLY when ``with_credentials`` is
    set — reserved for the network fetch step. Build steps (pip/npm) run
    worktree-controlled code and must never see a configured helper: a
    malicious install script could otherwise mint the operator's token via
    ``git credential fill``.

    ``with_credentials`` ALSO selects the PATH, and that is a security boundary,
    not a convenience:

    * credential-free (default) — the node toolchain dirs are PREPENDED to the
      trusted path. npm's own run-scripts (``tsc``, ``vite``) are
      ``#!/usr/bin/env node``, so ``node`` has to resolve by NAME inside the
      child; resolving only the ``npm`` argv would still fail at the first
      script. Those dirs live under ``$HOME`` because that is where
      ``ensure-node.sh`` installs node.
    * with credentials — the pinned ``_TRUSTED_PATH`` only. The fetch step's
      argv is an already-vetted absolute ``git``, but git looks its OWN helpers
      up (``git-remote-https``, credential helpers) on PATH, so a
      same-user-writable directory there would be a path to intercepting a
      credential-bearing fetch. Never widen this side.

    Scope of that guarantee, precisely: this ternary is what enforces it for the
    callers that spawn DIRECTLY (the ``raw_steps`` list, ``_pod_provision``,
    ``_start_run``). Callers that route through :func:`_run_cmd` are covered by
    a second, independent mechanism — ``_run_cmd`` overwrites PATH with
    ``_TRUSTED_PATH`` unconditionally, BEFORE it injects any credential helper —
    so on that path a node-augmented PATH from :func:`_pod_env` is discarded and
    never coexists with credentials. Both mechanisms must keep holding; do not
    remove one on the assumption that the other covers it.
