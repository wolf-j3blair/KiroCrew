"""Papyrus — git operations for a paper checked out from a remote.

Papers are often already in a git repository (a hosted LaTeX service exposes one,
and lab papers live in a normal repo), so the app can clone one as a project and
push commits back. Every git invocation here follows the same three rules as
:mod:`.latex`:

* **Never on the event loop.** ``git clone`` and ``git push`` are network
  operations that can take tens of seconds; they are spawned with
  :func:`asyncio.create_subprocess_exec` and awaited under a timeout.
* **Sandbox chokepoint.** The repository is agent- and user-influenced content
  whose local hooks and config can execute code, so every spawn routes through
  :func:`kiro_crew.sandbox.sandboxed_spawn_argv` (OS isolation + scrubbed env)
  and spawns through :func:`kiro_crew.sandbox.create_subprocess_limited`.
* **No argument smuggling.** The clone URL is matched against a scheme allowlist
  and passed after ``--``, so a value like ``--upload-pack=...`` can never be
  read as an option. The project directory is produced by
  :func:`.store.safe_project_dir`, never taken from the client verbatim.

    holds.

    Ensured on EVERY call, deliberately. The threat model here is an agent that can write
    into the project — the same write that plants ``filter.x.clean`` in ``.git/config`` can
    delete this file, so a once-at-clone-time pin would be removable by the very actor it

    Not a git repo yet (``clone``, whose *cwd* is the parent) → nothing to pin, and the
