    * BEFORE the tree is touched, because from the first move the manifest on disk
      differs from what any cached declaration describes, and a request that

    bumping first is an unauthorized write that persists.

    A cache that cannot be invalidated must not strand the operation, but it MUST be

    arrives mid-window reads the tree as it is being replaced, caches that under
    the just-bumped generation, and passes its own commit fence -- persisting a
    contribution the narrowing update is removing. ``revoke`` closes that: it adds
    a tombstone that denies regardless of enabled state until it is lifted, and it

    (ignored names at any depth, escaping links, in-tree links kept as links,
    absolute in-tree links rewritten) is not predicted here but produced. Then the
    gateway's own part is applied the way the runtime will meet it: ``.app_secret``
    is removed on every install -- :func:`install_app` and :func:`update_app`
    remove the copied entry, unfollowed, before writing the gateway's own file or

    the source's ``data/`` as itself, so an entry point under it is the source's
    there and only stops being so on the first update, which this same gate then
    refuses. Both removals are made by the direct path the install itself uses

    goes here as the install removes it there; where they do not (a Linux desktop)
    ``Data/`` is the app's own directory, carried as itself by the install and by
    this copy alike. Nothing is probed or listed -- a preview that read the tree by
    any rule other than the install's could only disagree with it. Then the one
    question the install asks of its own copy before writing the record is asked
    of this one: a root ``data`` entry left standing that is not a directory
    (:func:`gateway_data_dir_obstruction`) raises :class:`InstalledTreeRefused`
    with the install's own refusal, so the gate never admits a tree the install
    turns away -- and the refusal lands before any transaction touches the app
    directory, not after ``installed.json`` is written.

    The install-time desktop gate judges this tree instead of the checkout, so a
    layout the copy does not carry into the app directory is missing here exactly
    as it will be missing there. Blocking filesystem work: callers on the event
    loop run it off-loop, as they do the copy.

    :func:`is_app_enabled` collapses "not installed" and "unreadable" into a single
    False, because :func:`_read_installed` returns None for both. That is the right
    answer for a caller deciding whether to ACT on an app, and the wrong one for a caller
    deciding whether to DELETE its files: a transient read fault (EMFILE, EIO, a Windows
    AV lock) would be indistinguishable from a deliberate disable, and the deletion is
    unrecoverable. This keeps the two apart.

    A missing metadata file is a definite False — the app is not installed — not a
    failure to read one, and NOTHING ELSE is. Leading with ``Path.is_file()`` broke
    that: it answers a silent False for five path shapes that are not absence, all
    verified against this interpreter — a dangling symlink, a directory in the file's
    place, a fifo in its place, a symlink loop (ELOOP), and a non-directory parent
    component (ENOTDIR). Only a genuine ``stat`` fault such as EACCES was reported
    correctly, because ``is_file`` re-raises that and the handler below turns it into
    None.

    Absence is decided from the path's SHAPE, never from the exception class, because
    one condition does not produce one class across platforms: a non-directory parent
    component raises ``NotADirectoryError`` (ENOTDIR) on POSIX but
    ``FileNotFoundError`` on Windows, which maps ERROR_PATH_NOT_FOUND to ENOENT — the
    same class a genuinely missing file raises. Keying "definitely not installed" on
    ``FileNotFoundError`` therefore told the truth on Linux and not on Windows, where
    a wrong-shape parent still read as a deliberate uninstall. See
    :func:`_absence_is_genuine`; ``_spawn_exec_shim`` records the same lesson for
    ``chdir`` ("the errno is not the thing to key on").

    The cost of the wrong answer is asymmetric, which is why the callers that already
    respect the tri-state are the ones that make this worth fixing. ``apps.backend``
    reads it before DELETING materialized resources -- ``_drop_disabled_app_resources``
    on a False, ``_undo_promotion_of_disabled_app`` likewise -- and its own comments
    say a None "must not be collapsed into disabled" and is retried instead. That
    contract was already written correctly; it was this function that did not honour
    it, so a dangling symlink or a directory in the metadata's place deleted an app's
    agent files.

    ``apps.hook_reconcile`` consumes it too, and only because this fix put it there.
    Its unattended 15s teardown decides "gone" from ``get_app`` -> ``_read_installed``,
    which has the same ``Path.is_file()`` collapse and additionally folds a corrupt
    JSON body into None -- so before this change every one of those shapes unloaded a
    healthy app's routes and modules on the next tick. That reader has 24 callers and
    ``get_app``/``list_apps`` 63, so it is not made tri-state here; the reconciler
    confirms absence through THIS function instead and defers on unknown.

# Built-in app registration
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Built-in apps are features baked into the KiroCrew dashboard that we
# surface in the App Store as "builtin" entries.  They use the host's
# React tree directly (no ESM bundle) and their page components resolve
# through ``BUILTIN_COMPONENT_REGISTRY`` in the frontend.  The registration
# here is metadata-only so the App Store can display them alongside
# installable apps.
#
# Default-disabled policy: a builtin app ships with ``defaultEnabled: False``
# so a fresh install presents a minimal sidebar (core surfaces only) instead of
# every app at once. Apps are opt-in from the App Store Browse tab. Because
# ``register_builtin_apps()`` applies ``defaultEnabled`` only on first
# registration and preserves user state on restart, existing users keep
# whatever they already enabled — this only changes the out-of-the-box
# experience for new installs.
#
# The exception is _DEFAULT_ON_BUILTINS below.

# Builtins deliberately shipped ENABLED on a fresh install, exempt from the
# opt-in policy above because they are core surfaces rather than optional
# add-ons. Adding a name here is a product decision, not a convenience — keep
# the set small. A default-on builtin still honors the ``apps`` governance
# allowlist at registration (see _app_activation_denied), so a deny-by-default
# host policy is never bypassed.
#
# This is the single source of truth for the exemption: the policy tests over
# both the hardcoded list and the file-based manifests read it from here, so a
# builtin cannot become default-on in one registration path while the other
# path's test still forbids it.
_DEFAULT_ON_BUILTINS: frozenset[str] = frozenset(
    {
        "projects",  # Task Runner
        # Command Bar replaces the quick-search (Cmd+K) surface rather than adding
        # a sidebar entry, so shipping it off leaves the gesture on the legacy
        # palette and the launcher unseen. Disabling the app is what restores the
        # old surface, which is the opt-out this exemption trades for.
        "command-bar",
    }
)

# Promotions still owed to installs that PREDATE them — a different question from
# the set above, and the distinction is load-bearing.
#
# ``_DEFAULT_ON_BUILTINS`` answers "what does a FRESH install enable". This set
# answers "which promotion has not yet reached installs that registered the app
# while it was still default-off". Reading the first set for the second question
# reverses deliberate opt-outs: ``projects`` (Task Runner) has shipped
# ``defaultEnabled: true`` since it was aligned with the other builtins, long
# before this allowlist existed, so it has been enabled and visible in the
# sidebar on every existing install. A record showing ``enabled: false`` for it
# is therefore a user who FOUND it and turned it off — the opposite of the
# population a backfill exists to serve.
#
# So a name belongs here only when both hold: a fresh install enables it (it is
# in the set above), and existing installs were never in a position to choose.
# ``command-bar`` qualifies because it was default-OFF at first registration for
# those installs AND, replacing the quick-search surface rather than adding a
# sidebar entry, it appears on no store or launcher surface they could have found
# it on. An app already default-on when they installed it never qualifies.
#
# Entries are permanent, not cleaned up after a release: the marker is per
# install, so a user restoring an old data home still gets the promotion once.
_DEFAULT_ON_BACKFILL: frozenset[str] = frozenset({"command-bar"})


def backfill_default_on_builtins() -> list[str]:
    """Deliver a default-on PROMOTION to installs that predate it. One-shot per app.

    ``register_builtin_apps()`` applies ``defaultEnabled`` only on FIRST
    registration and preserves user state on every later start, so adding a name
    to ``_DEFAULT_ON_BUILTINS`` reaches NEW installs only. An install that
    registered the app while it was still default-off keeps ``enabled: false``
    through every subsequent restart, update and version bump — the record lives
    in the user's data home, which a code update does not touch.

    That is survivable for a builtin that adds a sidebar entry, because the App
    Store can still offer it. It is not survivable for one that replaces a host
    surface: it has no page, so it is absent from the launcher's own app list,
    and it is absent from Discover unless the published catalog carries a row for
    it, which leaves a disabled row in Library as the only trace. Those users
    cannot enable what they have no way to learn exists.

    Reads ``_DEFAULT_ON_BACKFILL``, NOT ``_DEFAULT_ON_BUILTINS`` — see that set's
    comment for why conflating the two silently reverses deliberate opt-outs.

    ONE-SHOT, and the record of that is ``InstalledApp.defaultOnBackfilled``,
    written in the SAME atomic record write that flips ``enabled``. One document
    deliberately: a separate marker file has no correct ordering, because
    whichever of the two writes goes first leaves a window the other one owns.
    Marker-last loses the record of an enable that happened, so every later start
    re-applies the promotion and reverses the user's own disable forever;
    marker-first can outlive a flip that failed, so the app is skipped forever and
    the promotion is never delivered. Both are real; neither is reachable when the
    flag and the state it guards land or fail together.

    Surviving a user's disable is the point: disabling the app is the ONLY thing
    that gives a replaced host surface back. Per app rather than per install, so a
    promotion added in a later release is still delivered.

    Returns the names actually flipped, so the caller can log them.
