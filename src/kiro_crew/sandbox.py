"""OS-level sandbox for agent child processes.

Hides sensitive credential paths from the kiro-cli subprocess tree using
platform-native isolation, per tier:

- ``standard`` (what the default ``"auto"`` resolves to) masks ``~/.gnupg``,
  ``~/.docker``, ``~/.azure``, ``~/.config/gcloud``, the crew vault and the
  governance cache -- and DELIBERATELY leaves ``~/.aws``, ``~/.ssh`` and
  ``~/.kube`` visible so the aws CLI, ``credential_process``, git-over-SSH and
  kubectl keep working inside the agent (see ``_STANDARD_DIRS``). The file
  tools still refuse those paths through ``is_sensitive_path``; a spawned
  shell's ``open()`` is not fenced at this tier.
- ``strict`` masks all of the above plus ``~/.aws``, ``~/.kube``,
  ``~/.config/gh`` and ``~/.ssh`` (exposing only ``~/.ssh/known_hosts``).
- ``cc`` is the Claude Code backend's tier: ``strict`` minus ``~/.ssh`` and
  ``~/.config/gh``, with a read-only copy of ``~/.aws/config`` exposed for
  Bedrock auth.

- **Linux**: fork → ``unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`` → parent writes identity
  UID/GID map → ``unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)`` → bind-mount empty dirs → exec.
  The child retains the real UID so all toolchains work normally.
- **macOS**: ``sandbox-exec`` with a Seatbelt profile that denies reads

The parent KiroCrew process is completely unaffected — isolation applies
only to the spawned child.  Falls back gracefully to no sandbox when the
OS mechanism is unavailable (logged as warning).

Config: ``"sandbox": "auto" | "strict" | "off"`` in ``~/.kiro/crew/config.json``.
``"auto"`` (default) uses the standard-tier namespace sandbox on Linux and
seatbelt on macOS; ``"strict"`` is the opt-in tier that also hides ``~/.aws``.

# ── The crew data home's governance tree, reconciled with security.py ──
#
# ``security.sensitive_home_dirs()`` is the AGENT-TOOL gate: it is what
# ``is_sensitive_path`` refuses for a file_read/file_write tool call. The lists in this
# module are a SEPARATE, OS-level gate — a spawned ``python -c`` or a shell command does
# an ``open()`` that never routes through the tool gate, so a path fenced only there is
# readable through any sandbox mode. Two entries (``.vault``, ``policy_cache``) were
# already carried in both; the rest of the governance tree was not, which left the
# ceiling itself (``security_policy.json``) readable and WRITABLE from an app lifecycle
# script, a script hook, or a command cron.
#
# Reconciling the two is NOT a union, and the reason is specific: Kiro Crew's own MCP
# servers (``mcp_core``, ``mcp_cron``, ``mcp_computer``) are spawned by kiro-cli UNDER
# this launcher and share the agent's mount namespace, as does a script cron's
# ``boot_platform()``. Whatever they open at OS level cannot be masked. So each crew-home
# leaf gets one of three dispositions:
#
#   HIDDEN    Nothing that runs inside the sandbox reads it. An empty dir/file is
#             bind-mounted over it, in EVERY mode — the treatment ``.vault`` already
#             gets, for the same reason.
#   READONLY  In-sandbox code READS it and a WRITE would let the agent choose its own
#             ceiling. Hiding a ceiling is the WRONG direction: an absent policy file
#             resolves to the permissive standalone default, so masking
#             ``security_policy.json`` from the process that enforces it REMOVES the
#             ceiling instead of protecting it. Exposed read-only instead, which is what
#             ``policy_cache`` already does.
#   VISIBLE   In-sandbox code needs READ *and* WRITE, so no OS rule can apply without
#             breaking it. These stay on the tool gate alone.
#
# ``test_sandbox_governance_mask.py`` pins the union of the three equal to the crew-home
# half of ``security.sensitive_home_dirs()``, so a leaf added there cannot silently land
# in none of them. Spelled here rather than imported so this low-level module keeps not
# importing the 7k-line security module (the ``_POLICY_CACHE_LEAF`` convention above).

#: The live-target pointer's file name under the crew data home.
#:
#: The pointer names the checkout the gateway execs into at startup, so it is masked from
#: EVERY sandboxed process — including Dev Fleet's own backend, whose cutover runs in the gateway.
#: That backend is a sandboxed spawn whose ``npm ci`` / build children run inside the same
#: namespace (a nested sandbox is denied by design), so any leaf it could reach, a
#: worktree's lifecycle script could reach too. The cutover therefore runs in the gateway
#: process (``dev_fleet/gateway_routes.py``) and the mask here stays whole; what this
#: module adds is a MOUNT TARGET for it (:func:`_materialize_live_target_mask_target`), so
#: the mask is never vacuous on a host that has not pinned a target yet. Spelled here
#: rather than imported from ``service.live_target`` to keep this low-level module free of
#: that import chain; ``test_sandbox_dev_fleet_live_target.py`` pins the spellings equal.
_LIVE_TARGET_LEAF: str = "live_target.json"
#: The masked DIRECTORY the pointer's absent-equivalent stub is staged in before it is
#: linked into place. Staging beside the target — in the data-home root — would put the
#: temp at a name every sandbox can see: a concurrent namespace could ``link(2)`` it and
#: keep a second, writable path to the inode the gateway later reads, and a bind mask
#: covers a PATH, not an inode. A hidden directory covers every name inside it, present
#: and future, so the temp is never visible; :func:`_materialize_live_target_mask_target`
#: additionally refuses any pointer whose link count is not exactly one. Same shape and
#: reason as ``_MD_NOTEBOOK_STAGING_LEAF`` / ``aws-control-staging``.
_LIVE_TARGET_STAGING_LEAF: str = "live-target-staging"

#: The masked DIRECTORY the gateway's own auth stores are staged in before they are
#: published. ``token_signing.key`` and ``refresh_chains.json`` are masked as individual
#: FILES, and a mask covers a PATH rather than an inode, so a temp staged BESIDE either of
#: them sits in the data-home root -- which is writable in-sandbox -- under a name no mask
#: covers. A same-uid agent that lists that root while a write is in flight can ``link(2)``
#: the temp and keep reading the bytes after the publish rename, and the spawn-time
#: :data:`_CREW_HARDLINK_REFUSED_LEAVES` check cannot see it: that check runs before a
#: spawn, while this window opens during one. A crash between write and publish leaves the
#: same unmasked file on disk holding the same bytes.
#:
#: A directory mask covers every name inside it, present and future, so both the staging
#: window and a crash orphan are covered. Same shape and reason as
#: :data:`_LIVE_TARGET_STAGING_LEAF`, :data:`_MD_NOTEBOOK_STAGING_LEAF` and
#: ``aws-control-staging``; the gateway process is the only writer, so unlike md-notebook it
#: needs no backend carve-out to hand the directory back to a sandboxed app.
_AUTH_STORE_STAGING_LEAF: str = "auth-store-staging"

#: The md-notebook builtin's name, and its own state files under the crew data home.
#: Named so the mask, the backend carve-out that lifts it, and the materialiser that
#: gives it a mount target cannot drift apart on a literal.
MD_NOTEBOOK_APP_NAME: str = "md-notebook"
_MD_NOTEBOOK_STATE_LEAVES: tuple[str, ...] = (

    f"workspace/{MD_NOTEBOOK_APP_NAME}/settings.json",
)
#: The backend's write-staging directory, masked as a WHOLE DIRECTORY like ``whatsapp``.
#: Every md-notebook state writer stages its temp file HERE and renames onto its target,
#: because a temp staged BESIDE the target carries the real PAT bytes under a name the
#: three leaf masks do not cover — and a SIGKILL between write and rename leaves that
#: unmasked sibling readable by a same-uid sandboxed agent forever. A directory mask
#: covers every name inside it, present and future, so the staging window and any crash
#: orphan both stay masked.
#:
#: A TOP-LEVEL leaf, for the same reason ``aws-control-staging`` is one: a mask covers the
#: leaf, not its ancestors, so a staging dir under the agent-writable
#: ``workspace/md-notebook`` could be renamed out from under its own mask and a later PAT
#: write would publish through the replacement, unmasked, into a live agent's view. It
#: stays on the same filesystem as the state files (both under the crew data home), so the
#: publish rename is still atomic.

    # namespace (see the reconciliation note above) and an app backend is itself a
    # sandboxed spawn -- so each is served the way the Notes state files below
    # are: whatever SPAWNS it allocates host-side and passes that one key
    # directory back as a window, never a lift of the mask. Leaving the mask
    # window-less is what keeps the failure honest: on Linux the mask is a
    # WRITABLE empty tmpfs bind, so an in-sandbox allocation would otherwise
    # succeed and lose its bytes with the namespace.

    # issue or pull-request number, so a later run finds the directory again --
    # so an unmasked root would let one session tree guess a name and rewrite
    # another job's in-flight clone, a sharper hazard than the random-suffixed
    # scratch names carry. The mask alone would be VACUOUS here, which is why this
    # leaf appears in two more places: the root is created lazily by the first
    # ``allocate_work`` call, so it is also in ``_CREW_PRECREATE_HIDDEN_DIR_LEAVES``

#:
#: Two reasons put a leaf here, and the distinction matters to anyone adding one.
#: Almost every entry carries a live credential or a capability, so no child should
#: ever read it. One entry instead belongs to a SINGLE harness, so a blanket grant
#: would be too wide: it is withheld here and handed back to that one harness by
#: ``tool_gate.adapter_hidden_credential_dirs``, which keys its gate-artifact
#: exclusion on the backend. "Withheld" therefore means "not granted to everyone",
#: not always "secret".
#:
#: Paired with that list rather than derived from it. Neither is the complement of
#: the other at runtime: both are written out, and
#: ``test_sandbox_governance_mask`` pins that together they cover
#: ``_CREW_SANDBOX_VISIBLE_LEAVES | _CREW_READONLY_LEAVES`` exactly and do not
#: overlap. That pin is the whole point -- see :data:`_CREW_CHILD_READABLE_LEAVES`.
#:
#: Every entry carries a live credential or a capability, so handing it to a
#: third-party binary that self-approves its own passive reads is the exact class
#: that mask exists to compensate for. The first-class path's own disposition is
#: looser (``AGENTS.md`` records ``sel_hmac.key`` as a knowingly-carried VISIBLE
#: residual with no OS fence), and widening that residual from Crew-shipped binaries
#: to any enforced harness is a decision an operator makes, not one a mask change
#: inherits. Closing it properly means moving each in-sandbox reader behind the
#: gateway -- never a looser mask.
#:
#: ``run`` is here for the same reason and needs one extra fact, because
#: :data:`_CREW_SANDBOX_VISIBLE_LEAVES` says the child "cannot exec if it is masked".
#: That is true of the tier's OWN mask and not of this one: the Linux launcher
#: bind-mounts the empty dirs AFTER it is already running and only then execs
#: (``fork -> unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER) -> unshare(CLONE_NEWNS) -> bind -> exec``), so a
#: masked ``run`` never blocks the launcher that lives in it. It blocks only a child
#: that execs a SECOND artifact out of ``run`` from inside the namespace. The answer
#: for such a child is to move its artifact to a credential-free leaf of its own,
#: never to expose ``run`` and with it ``run/gateway-<port>.secret``, which
#: ``config.loader.read_local_secret`` resolves BEFORE the shared ``.local_secret``.
#:
#: The pi gate is exactly that child, and it takes that answer: its launcher and
#: sealed extension live under their own ``pi-gate`` leaf, so a pi session starts with
#: ``run`` masked. Keeping ``run`` masked is what makes such a leaf the answer;
#: exposing it to unbreak one harness would hand the gateway credential to four.

    non-hidden crew leaves that is no input to an authorization decision and either
    holds no credential or is one an in-sandbox Crew process cannot boot without: the
    browser launcher, the authorization sidecars (``apps/.dev-grants.json``,
    ``settings_seeds.json``, the model-state pair), the gateway-owned run and decision
    records, the operator's cloud configuration, and the runtime config pair
    (``config.json`` / ``config.local.json``). That last pair is the exception the
    "either" carries: it can hold an inline channel bot token, and stays readable
    because every in-sandbox ``KiroCrewConfig.load()`` depends on it and it was never
    on the read-gate floor to begin with -- see its entry in the list.
    Its sibling :data:`_CREW_CHILD_WITHHELD_LEAVES` carries the rest, and
    ``test_sandbox_governance_mask`` pins the pair complete and disjoint against
    ``_CREW_SANDBOX_VISIBLE_LEAVES | _CREW_READONLY_LEAVES``, so a leaf added to
    either source list must be classified before it can ship.

    Two of the withheld entries are counter-intuitive on their names alone, which is
    why the pin exists rather than a convention: ``member-memory-bindings`` stores raw
    session keys rather than digests, and ``run`` holds the per-listener gateway
    credential next to the launcher. "Sounds like metadata" is not a classification.

    Published for the ONE caller that builds a second, independent mask over the same
    data home -- ``agent_sdk.tool_gate.adapter_hidden_credential_dirs``, the OS
    credential mask an enforced adapter is confined by. That mask projects the whole
    READ-GATE floor, and the floor covers a Crew runtime artifact for a different
    reason than a credential: it stops the AGENT'S OWN FILE TOOLS from opening one,
    while Crew's writers open it directly. Handed to a sandbox as a deny list, the
    same entry hides the artifact from the CHILD -- which is not the reader the floor
    was aiming at, and is the reader these lists exist to serve.

    The governance ceiling is NOT in this set, and that is deliberate rather than an
    omission -- see the governance family in
    :data:`_CREW_CHILD_WITHHELD_LEAVES`. It is the case where the two readers pull
    hardest in opposite directions: an empty bind over ``security_policy.json`` makes
    ``boot_platform()`` raise, so an in-sandbox Crew process under an enforced harness
    stops booting on exactly the governed hosts that set one. That cost is accepted
    because it lands in the safe direction -- a session refuses rather than proceeding
    ungoverned -- and a ceiling is an INPUT TO AN AUTHORIZATION DECISION, which a
    foreign harness's child reads through a channel that reaches no gate and leaves no
    record. So do not read the paragraph above as licence to move a ceiling or a
    consent record here to make a harness boot.

    Subtracting these is not a hole. An unenforced harness's child already sees every
    leaf that remains (those harnesses get no mask at all), each readonly entry is
    independently re-sealed read-only by ``wrap_argv``, and the read gate still fences
    all of them from the agent's own file tools. The two controls keep covering
    different readers.

    Derived from the lists, never re-spelled. A hand-copied list would drift the
    moment a leaf is added above, and the drift is silent in the safe-looking
    direction: the new leaf keeps its mask entry and the enforced harnesses alone
    lose it.

    A carve-out naming only one of them lifts only that entry. Where a second

    the link — its mask survives and bind-mounts an empty directory back over the

    """Whether carving *path* out of the sandbox masks would unmask a foreign tree.

    ``_hidden_path_contains_visible_path`` cancels any hidden mask entry that
    CONTAINS a visible path, so an ``extra_visible_dirs`` spelling that sits
    beneath an independently masked directory takes that whole foreign mask
    down with it — a data home relocated beneath a credential directory (e.g.
    ``KIROCREW_HOME`` under ``~/.aws``) would hand every spawn that asks for a
    crew-home carve-out the entire credential tree. Both EQUALITY-shaped
    crew-home carve-out producers call this before adding a spelling —
    :func:`app_backend_visible_targets` and the policy-cache site in
    ``apps/backend.py``. The aws-control per-call staging carve-out is the
    ANCESTOR-LIFT shape instead: its temp dir is a proper descendant of the mask
    entry the lift cancels, so asking about that dir refuses on every layout,
    the default one included. It asks about the staging ROOT instead — the mask
    entry itself, which the equality rule below exempts while every OTHER masked
    ancestor still refuses. Same verdict, no parameter: no mask entry can sit
    between a root and the per-call dir minted directly inside it, and that dir
    is a fresh random name no list carries. On refusal the mask stays
    and the carve-out's consumer fails closed (EPERM for an app backend's own
    state, an unreadable cache for a cache-only backend), which is strictly
    safer than unmasking a foreign tree. The refusal is logged with the
    offending ancestor so the misconfiguration is actionable.

    The mask universe is the EFFECTIVE tier's dir list — *mode* run through the
    same ``sandbox.min_level`` clamp :func:`wrap_argv` applies (see
    :func:`effective_sandbox_mode`) — NOT the union of every tier: ``standard``
    deliberately leaves ``~/.aws`` visible, so a data home relocated beneath it
    shadows nothing in an ungoverned standard-mode spawn, and refusing there
    would break the carve-out's consumer for zero security gain. A governed
    floor that clamps the spawn up is honoured by construction, because the
    clamp result is what selects the list. Two deliberate asymmetries, both in
    the refusal direction: ``cc`` uses the launcher's list on every platform
    (the macOS profile builder drops ``.aws`` from it in favour of file-level
    rules, so macOS ``cc`` can only over-refuse), and a tier that cannot be
    resolved falls back to the union of every tier. The relocated mask entries
    the builders add in every mode are included on BOTH paths, so a carve-out
    leaf beneath a relocated wholesale mask is judged against it too. Two
    builder additions are deliberately absent: ``_voice_runtime_sandbox_paths``
    (fixed runtime sockets no crew-home carve-out can sit beneath) and a
    caller's ``extra_hidden_dirs`` (neither guarded producer's spawn passes
    any).

    The floor is re-read by ``wrap_argv`` at wrap time; a floor RAISED in the
    interval between this check and the wrap is honoured for the masks but not
    for this refusal. Exploiting that window requires an operator to both
    tighten governance and have already relocated the data home beneath a
    newly-masked tree — operator actions, not agent-reachable ones.

    Equality is not shadowing — carve-out spellings ARE masked entries, and
    unhiding exactly themselves is the carve-out's whole job; only a PROPER
    ancestor is foreign. An ancestor-lift producer therefore asks about the mask
    entry it lifts, never about the descendant it hands to the spawn.

    Fails toward refusal, never raises: when home (or the path itself) cannot
    be resolved the mask universe cannot be checked, so the spelling is
    reported shadowed and the spawn proceeds with the mask intact.

#: The subset of ``_CREW_READONLY_LEAVES`` the launcher may CREATE in order to seal.
#:
#: ``mount(2)`` cannot target a path that does not exist, so the READONLY seal below
#: skips an absent ceiling and leaves the data home writable at that name — which is
#: the whole hole on a default install, where none of these has been written yet.
#: Materialising the path first closes it, and that is only sound for a leaf that
#: clears BOTH of the following.
#:
#: 1. An EMPTY document must mean what an ABSENT file means to the reader:
#:
#:    * ``profiles`` — an empty dir yields no profile, same as no dir;
#:    * ``memory_stores`` — an empty root declares or provisions no store. The
#:      gateway can later create named stores inside the directory bind; no
#:      database, member configuration or Global V1 path is created here;
#:    * ``playwright-cli`` — an empty dir means the launcher is absent,
#:      exactly as a missing dir does; its directory bind shows a later gateway
#:      install while withholding every agent-side write;
#:    * ``computer_use.json`` — ``computer_use.enable_state.load_state`` reads ``{}``
#:      as DISABLED, which is what an absent keystone means;
#:    * ``oauth_endpoints.json`` — ``security._validate_operator_oauth_entries``
#:      extends trust by nothing for ``{}``;
#:    * ``aws_service_consent.json`` — ``aws_consent._read_all`` returns ``{}`` for
#:      both absent and empty, so every service stays unconfirmed;
#:    * ``decisions_consent.json`` — ``decisions.consent.load_state`` reads ``{}``
#:      as NOT CONSENTED, which is what an absent keystone means;
#:    * ``settings_seeds.json`` — ``acp.seed_provenance._load`` finds no ``seeds``
#:      mapping in ``{}`` and returns having recorded nothing, so every settings
#:      path reads as unowned. Identical to absent, and the leaf that most needs
#:      materialising: it is written only once a claude-agent-acp session has
#:      actually seeded a work dir, so on every install that has not it is exactly
#:      the absent-and-therefore-writable name this list exists to close.
#:
#: 2. A STALE read of that empty document must fail toward refusal. The seal is a
#:    bind mount, which pins the INODE for the sandbox's lifetime, while every
#:    dashboard writer publishes through ``atomic_write`` (temp + rename), i.e. a NEW
#:    inode. So a sandboxed reader keeps seeing the empty document even after the
#:    operator writes the real one. For the three JSON files above that freezes them at
#:    "disabled" / "no consent" / "no extra endpoints" — narrower than the truth, and
#:    for ``settings_seeds.json`` at "Crew owns no settings file", so the writer takes
#:    its leave-it-alone branch: the seed is not refreshed, and nothing is overwritten
#:    or unlinked. The empty ``profiles`` dir is exempt from the concern entirely: a
#:    directory bind shows live contents, so a profile added later is visible.
#:
#: DELIBERATELY EXCLUDED, and each for a different one of those two reasons:
#:
#:   * ``denied_commands.json`` — clears (1) but fails (2), which is the direction
#:     that matters: in-sandbox ``mcp_cron`` reads it to decide whether a command is
#:     denied, so a pinned ``{}`` would report "nothing is denied" for the rest of the
#:     sandbox's life even after the operator denies a command. Sealing it would trade
#:     an agent-authored deny list for a stale one, so it keeps the pre-existing gap;
#:   * ``security_policy.json`` — fails (1). ``governance.load_security_policy`` reads
#:     the file whenever it exists and fails CLOSED on a parse or version mismatch, so
#:     a ``{}`` stub raises ``PlatformCompositionError`` out of a function that runs at
#:     boot AND per app callback;
#:   * ``app_admission.json`` — fails (1). Absent means ``open_default()`` (admit),
#:     while present-but-unreadable means deny-all; a stub would refuse every app;
#:   * ``admission_policy.json`` — already seeded at first run by
#:     ``platform.admission.seed_default_policy``, so it is not absent to begin with.
#:
#: The same ``mount(2)`` limit leaves the ``SENSITIVE_DIRS`` / ``SENSITIVE_FILES``
#: mask loops skipping their own absent targets. That is a real sibling gap, not one
#: this list closes: a mask needs the opposite treatment (an empty bind OVER the
#: name), and ``_CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES`` has no reader to prove an empty document is
#: absent-equivalent, so each leaf needs its own argument.

#: The one masked leaf that carries its own argument (see the sibling-gap note
#: above): a DIRECTORY the gateway creates on demand, whose EMPTY state is

#: creation, a sandbox spawned on a fresh install before the first transfer finds

#: loop no name, and the marker that must outlive an agent's process would be

#:   drops its own directory, and forges records the gateway reads back as
#:   authoritative -- past the ownership check and past the redactors.
#: * ``panel-templates`` -- holds the human-authored TEMPLATE whose separation from

#:   authoring markup that renders in the panel, not changing a setting.
#: * ``panel-dismissals`` -- created on demand by the GATEWAY and read by nothing
#:   else, and the link hazard is identical to ``crew-panels``: the mask attaches to
#:   the target while the link NAME stays writable in the data home, so a sandboxed
#:   process unlinks it, drops its own directory, and forges dismissals the gateway
#:   reads back as the operator's -- hiding finished runs from the panel.

#: Tolerated means NOT REFUSED, never NOT LOOKED AT. The pass visits these leaves and logs a
#: warning, because the alias really is outside the mask: excluding them from the walk would
#: reproduce, on the credential leaf, exactly the silence the pass exists to end.
#:
#: * ``.env`` -- the operator's OWN channel-credential file, authored by hand and
#:   documented as such (``docs/architecture/overview.md`` lists it as "channel tokens,
#:   owner id"). It is the clearest member of the class ``_warn_if_alias_backed`` exists

#: disk would find no agent could start, over a file they may never have created.
#:
#: Every OTHER multi-component masked leaf refuses, because no such compensating control
#: exists for it: nothing withholds anything when ``apps/aws-control`` is a link, so the
#: mask binds the referent while the writable alias name persists.
_CREW_ALIAS_CHAIN_DEGRADE_LEAVES: frozenset[str] = frozenset(_MD_NOTEBOOK_PRECREATE_CONTENT)

#: Masked leaves where an extra HARD LINK refuses the spawn rather than warning.
#:
#: The mask binds a PATH, so it does not follow the inode: a second name on the same inode
#: is an unmasked way to the same bytes, for reading AND for writing, and no check on the
#: masked name can see it. That is the same reasoning
#: :func:`_refuse_unless_sole_regular_link` already applies to the live-target pointer,
#: where ``st_nlink != 1`` refuses; this set carries it to the leaves whose bytes are
#: themselves a usable secret.
#:
#: MEMBERSHIP RULE, so a leaf added later inherits a decision instead of silence: the
#: leaf's bytes are usable off this host on their own -- a signing key, a bearer token, a
#: session cookie, a password. A leaf masked for INTEGRITY instead, where the harm is an
#: agent WRITING it, stays a warning: the write alias is real, but those leaves each have a
#: reader that re-validates the content, and refusing on them would widen the spawn-failure
#: surface past the bytes an attacker can simply walk away with.
#:
#: Only a REGULAR FILE can carry a second hard link -- ``link(2)`` refuses a directory --
#: so every directory leaf is outside this decision by shape rather than by judgement, and
#: no entry here needs to name one.
#:
#: * ``token_signing.key`` -- signs dashboard access and refresh tokens. The bytes forge
#:   any session cookie, so a read is a full authentication bypass.
#: * ``refresh_chains.json`` -- the refresh-token chain state that decides which refresh
#:   presentations are still live; a read continues an operator's session.
#: * the auth SQLite store and its WAL, SHM and journal sidecars -- its own entry in
#:   :data:`_CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES` states the reason this set needs: the bytes ARE a live
#:   bearer token, and the sidecars hold the same bytes mid-transaction.
#: * ``.env`` -- the operator's channel credentials, the live Slack, Discord and Telegram
#:   tokens. It is TOLERATED for a symlink in :data:`_CREW_ALIAS_TOLERATED_LEAVES` and
#:   deliberately NOT tolerated here: that tolerance exists for the layout a dotfile
#:   manager produces, and chezmoi and stow produce a SYMLINK or a copy. A hard link on
#:   this file is not that supported layout, and it is the highest-value secret in the home.
#: * the Notes personal access token -- a live bearer credential for the operator's
#:   repositories. Reachable from inside the sandbox rather than only by pre-planting: the
#:   Notes backend is itself a sandboxed spawn holding a legitimate window on this leaf, so
#:   one agent can create the second name and an ordinary session then reads the token.
#: * ``ops_mission_control_secrets.json`` -- the app's credential store by name.
#: * ``browser-cookies.txt``, ``playwright-storage-state.json`` and
#:   ``playwright-extension-token`` -- browser session material: site cookies, the storage
#:   state that carries them plus localStorage tokens, and the extension's bearer token.
#:   Retired leaves with no reader left in the tree, kept here for the reason
#:   ``.kiro_cli_binary_trust.json`` gives for being masked at all -- a backup restore can
#:   resurrect one, and a restored cookie jar is a live credential again.
#:
#: The cost is stated rather than hidden: an extra hard link refuses EVERY agent spawn on
#: the host, including when the second name sits outside the sandbox where it is harmless,
#: because ``st_nlink`` reports that a second name exists and not where it is.
#: :func:`masked_credential_leaf_aliases` is what keeps that from arriving as an
#: unexplained outage -- ``kirocrew doctor`` reports the condition before a spawn refuses
#: on it, the same answer the live-target pointer's own read already gives for the same

    The file analogue of :func:`_require_real_dir_nofollow`, and stricter than
    :func:`_warn_if_alias_backed` on purpose. That function only WARNS about the two
    shapes an ``MS_RDONLY`` bind cannot cover -- a symlink whose NAME stays replaceable,
    and a regular file carrying a second hardlink whose alias sits outside the mount --
    because refusing them for every ceiling would turn an ordinary dotfile manager or
    snapshot tool into a hard spawn failure, a wider blast radius than the exposure.

    That trade is right for a ceiling whose worst case is a stale policy, and wrong for a
    leaf whose contents pick an unrecoverable action. Two do: an aliased ``cloud.json``
    picks the container image a Fargate launch runs, and the task's execution role
    delivers the model credential into it; an aliased launch record picks which stack a
    ``cloud destroy --yes`` deletes. Both refuse, and both refuse at the seam that
    CONSUMES the file rather than on the spawn path, so the cost is one command's refusal
    instead of every sandboxed spawn on a host whose files legitimately carry a second
    name. Callers keep using :func:`_warn_if_alias_backed` for every other leaf.

    *harm* names what a write through the second name buys, and *remedy* is the one
    command that clears it. They come from the CALLER, with no default, because the two
    strict leaves are refused for different reasons and a message naming the wrong
    consequence sends an operator at the wrong file -- and because a third leaf must state
    its own reason rather than silently inherit the first one's.

    UNCONDITIONAL, and an earlier version of this was not. It exempted a file that
    carried no Fargate block, on the reasoning that an alias selects no image when there
    is no image -- which is wrong, because the agent does not need to swap a field it can
    CREATE. Given a writable alias and no block, an agent writes a COMPLETE block through
    the alias and the owner's next launch runs the image it chose. That is the same
    reasoning that already put this leaf in the pre-create list, where an ABSENT file is
    the dangerous case for exactly this reason; the exemption failed to carry it one step
    further. Any rule that reads the file's current contents has the same hole, because
    contents are what the attacker supplies, so this rule reads no contents at all.

    *fd* is an OPEN descriptor for the file the caller has ALREADY READ, and it changes
    which inode this answers about. Without it the check ``lstat``s the NAME and the
    caller then opens that name again, so the inode that was judged and the inode that was
    consumed are two separate resolutions and nothing ties them together. With it the
    judgement lands on the very descriptor the bytes came from, so a swap at the name
    between the two cannot put un-judged content in front of a caller: the alias question
    is asked about what was read rather than about what the name pointed at earlier.

    The symlink branch is skipped in that mode because it cannot arise there and cannot be
    answered there: a descriptor obtained with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` refuses a symlinked leaf at
    ``open`` time with ``ELOOP``, and ``fstat`` on an ordinary descriptor never reports
    ``S_IFLNK`` in any case. Callers therefore keep the by-name form as well, which is what
    still produces the symlink refusal and its remedy.

    **Fail-closed.** If a ceiling cannot be made sealable this raises
    :class:`SandboxCeilingUnsealable` and the spawn does not happen. That is a
    deliberate reversal of an earlier best-effort version, which warned and continued:
    continuing means the launcher's ``os.path.exists`` guard skips the path, so the
    sandboxed process runs with a writable governance keystone and nothing downstream
    notices. An unsealed ceiling is the one thing this function exists to prevent, so it
    refuses for the same reason ``_mount_or_die`` refuses a failed hiding mount.

    Two states trigger it:

    * a **dangling symlink** squatting a ceiling path. ``os.path.exists`` follows
      symlinks, so it reads as absent to this function AND to the launcher's guard,
      while ``os.link`` refuses the name as ``EEXIST`` — the sandboxed process's write
      then follows the link and the host reads the result back through the ceiling path.
      It is not removed here: ``islink`` followed by ``unlink`` is not atomic, and the
      dashboard publishes a real keystone over that same name with ``atomic_write``, so
      a removal racing a validated operator write would delete the operator's new
      settings. POSIX offers no unlink-only-if-still-a-symlink, so the safe answer is to
      refuse and let a human resolve it;
    * a **creation failure** other than ``EEXIST`` — a read-only mount, or a filesystem
      with no hardlink support.

    ``EEXIST`` is benign for ordinary ceilings: another spawn or the operator won
    the race and the launcher seals the winner. Strict executable directories have
    a higher bar. Their winner is re-checked with ``lstat`` and must be a real
    directory, because a symlink would move the mount off the name the gateway later
    resolves.

    from. The harm is narrower than ``cloud.json``'s and just as unrecoverable: a write
    through an unsealed second name puts any tag in the record, and ``cloud destroy --yes``
    deletes the stack it names. ``cloud launch`` re-attaching to a forged tag is the same
    substitution, quieter.

    The record is sealed against agent writes on three layers already -- the file-write
    gate, the kernel read-only seal, and pre-creation so an absent name cannot be squatted
    -- and every one of those covers a PATH. An alias reaches the same inode by a name none
    of them names, which is exactly the gap this refuses; the layers are what keep an agent
    from creating the alias in the first place, and this is what stops a tag being consumed
    from one that already exists.

    Takes the path being READ rather than deriving it, so the file this checks and the file
    the caller goes on to consume cannot be two different files.

    *fd* is how the check stops being a check-then-use. Without it this ``lstat``s the NAME
    and the caller opens that name again, so the judged inode and the consumed inode are two
    resolutions with a window between them. ``LaunchState.load`` therefore calls this twice:
    once by name, which is what refuses a symlinked leaf and names the remedy, and once on
    the DESCRIPTOR the record's bytes were actually read from, after the read. The second
    call is what ties the answer to the inode that was consumed, so content that was never
    judged cannot be put in front of a caller by swapping the name in between.

    What that does NOT close, stated because the guard's value depends on it: an alias that
    existed EARLIER, was written through in place, and was unlinked before this read leaves a
    lone regular file holding forged bytes, and no ``lstat`` or ``fstat`` rule can see that
    an inode once had a second name. Closing that shape needs the tag verified through a
    channel the sandbox cannot reach, or the unbounded verb requiring an explicit ``--tag``;
    both are design choices for the launch lane rather than something this seam can decide.
    So this remains one layer of several -- what it now guarantees is that the layer answers
    about the right inode.

    NOT added to :data:`_CREW_NOFOLLOW_READONLY_FILE_LEAVES`. That list is walked where a
    spawn is prepared, so a leaf in it refuses every sandboxed spawn on a host whose files
    legitimately carry a second name (stow, chezmoi, ``rsync --link-dest``) -- the whole box

    """Close a second hard link on a masked CREDENTIAL leaf, and return what to mask.

    The masks bind PATHS, so a second name to a masked leaf is a second way to the same
    bytes that the mask says nothing about. Three outcomes, in the order they are preferred,
    because only the first one costs nothing:

    * EVERY other name is FOUND under a data home -- returned, for the caller to add to this
      spawn's hidden set. The bytes become unreachable in every namespace, which is what a
      refusal was standing in for, and no spawn is refused. This is the outcome that resolves
      the tension the other two trade against. "Every" is the load-bearing word and is
      COUNTED, not assumed: the leaf's own name plus the located ones must equal
      ``st_nlink``. Masking one name out of two remaining leaves the other readable while
      reporting the hole closed, and a walk that stopped at its cap reaches this same test
      with a short count.
    * a name is NOT under any data home, or not every name could be located -- the snapshot
      and backup case (``cp -al``, rsnapshot, ``rsync --link-dest``), which cannot be masked
      because it cannot be located without walking the filesystem. REFUSED in the live home,
      which is the cost this control has always accepted there, and reported elsewhere.
      Whatever WAS located is masked on the way, since a located name left readable would be
      strictly worse, but it does not buy the first outcome.
    * the leaf is absent, is a link, or is not a regular file -- skipped. Only a regular file
      can carry a second hard link, and ``lstat`` never follows a link, so the symlink case
      belongs to the pass that has a sentence for it.

    Every masked home is INSPECTED, not only the live one, because the masks cover every home
    (see :func:`_masked_crew_home_roots`) while ``config_dir()`` names one: a ``.env`` under
    an un-migrated ``~/.kirocrew``, or one left in the default home by a ``KIROCREW_HOME``
    relocation, holds live channel tokens and is masked.

    Only the live home REFUSES, and only in the unlocatable case. A mask target is bound only
    when it EXISTS -- the loop that seals them is gated on ``os.path.isdir``, whose own
    comment records that an absent directory left unsealed "would be creatable from inside
    the sandbox" -- so a home the install does not use is masked by nothing while it is
    absent, and a sandboxed process can create it and write what it likes inside. A refusal
    there would be reachable by the governed process itself: one ``mkdir`` plus one ``ln``,
    and every later spawn refuses until an operator finds a dotfile in a directory they have
    never opened. The live home carries the opposite properties: it exists, so it IS masked,
    so nothing inside it can be planted from a sandbox.

    The symlink and linked-component refusals in :func:`_refuse_aliased_masked_leaves` stay
    live-home-only deliberately: a host part-way through a migration legitimately points the
    legacy home AT the live one, and refusing every spawn for that layout would break working
    hosts while closing nothing -- the two names then share a single inode, which the live
    home's own pass already judges.

    A leaf reached through a linked INTERMEDIATE component is skipped with a warning, not
    refused. ``lstat`` leaves only the final component un-followed, so for a multi-component
    leaf (``workspace/md-notebook/pat`` is the one such entry here) a planted link above it
    makes this read report the link count of a file somewhere else entirely -- refusing on
    that would fail every spawn over a number belonging to a file outside the data home.
    The chain case has its own control: :data:`_CREW_ALIAS_CHAIN_DEGRADE_LEAVES` records
    why those leaves degrade rather than refuse, and :func:`_refuse_aliased_masked_leaves`
    applies it. Escalating here would invert that decision.

    """Refuse the spawn when a MASKED leaf is reachable under a second name.

    The mask is a bind mount, so it attaches to the path the leaf RESOLVES to while the
    leaf's own name stays in the writable data home. A symlinked leaf therefore reads as
    masked and is not: a sandboxed process unlinks the name, drops its own directory or
    file there, and every later read goes to bytes it controls -- past whatever ownership
    check or redactor the gateway applies to the masked path. Warning and continuing is
    what made that silent, which is the whole reason this pass refuses.

    **Both the leaf and its components below the data home.** ``lstat`` leaves only the
    FINAL component un-followed, so a leaf checked that way alone still resolves through a
    planted link at an intermediate component, and multi-component masked leaves genuinely
    exist (``apps/aws-control/data``, ``apps/meetings/data/edits``, the md-notebook state
    leaves). Those intermediates sit inside the agent-writable data home, so a link at one
    of them lands the mask on an attacker-chosen tree while the lexical name stays
    replaceable -- the same hole one level up. Components are walked root-first by
    :func:`_first_linked_component_below`; the data home itself and its parents are NOT
    walked, because ``config_dir()`` documents that a symlinked data HOME is supported.

    Creates NOTHING. An ABSENT leaf is skipped, and that is what makes one pass safe over
    EVERY masked leaf rather than only the materialised ones: a store that has not been
    used yet offers no name to alias, and the retired ``ledgers`` root must not be
    re-materialised on every machine (see its entry in :data:`_CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES`, which
    says so). Giving the leaves that need a mount target one is a different job, and
    :func:`_materialize_maskable_dirs` does it for the nine it covers.

    Runs LAST on the spawn path, after every materialiser, so a leaf with its own tailored
    refusal answers first and keeps its own sentence: ``live_target.json`` shares its
    wording with ``kirocrew doctor`` and the md-notebook leaves name their own documents,
    and a generic message arriving first would replace both.

    SYMLINKS refuse. An extra HARDLINK refuses for the leaves whose bytes are themselves a
    usable secret and is WARNED for the rest -- :data:`_CREW_HARDLINK_REFUSED_LEAVES` is
    that set and argues each entry. The split is where the cost sits: ``st_nlink`` says a
    second name EXISTS and not where it is, so refusing also refuses a link that
    ``rsync --link-dest`` or a snapshot tool left outside the sandbox, where it is
    harmless. For a credential leaf that is the right trade and the same one
    :func:`_refuse_unless_sole_regular_link` already makes for the live-target pointer; for
    a leaf masked only so an agent cannot WRITE it, the reader re-validates the content and
    a spawn-wide outage is not proportionate. Either way the warning is emitted HERE rather
    than left to :func:`_warn_if_alias_backed`, which never runs over these leaves.

    The credential refusal itself is issued by :func:`_refuse_multilinked_credential_leaves`,
    called at the end of this pass, because it has to cover EVERY masked home while this
    loop covers ``config_dir()``. The symlink and linked-component refusals stay scoped to
    this one home on purpose; that function's docstring gives the reason.

    A TOLERATED leaf is VISITED and WARNED, never skipped. Excluding it from the walk is the
    same silence one level along: a symlinked ``.env`` carries live channel tokens and is
    replaceable by the very mechanism described above, so saying nothing about it would
    reproduce the property this pass ends while claiming to end it. Tolerating the layout is
    the decision; tolerating it silently is not part of that decision.

    Per spawn rather than once per process, matching :func:`_warn_if_alias_backed`'s own
    stated reason: a host where this keeps happening has a real problem, and de-duplicating

    there is no agent-writable intermediate component for a planted link to redirect, and
    no per-component descent is needed — the whole hazard
    :func:`_materialize_md_notebook_mask_targets` walks chains to avoid.

    Why at all: the launcher's ``SENSITIVE_FILES`` loop guards on ``isfile``, so an absent
    pointer is an UNMASKED pointer for every namespace already running, and the crew data
    home is writable at OS level. An agent in such a namespace can simply CREATE the

    Publishing the document first makes the mask non-vacuous, so every namespace binds an
    empty file over the name from the outset.
    :data:`_LIVE_TARGET_PRECREATE_CONTENT` carries the absent-equivalence argument.

    a path rule that already holds for a name which does not exist yet, so macOS needs
    nothing here. The LIVE data home only (``config_dir()``) — a stub under the deprecated
    spelling would be a file nothing reads — and an absent data home is left absent.

    **Fail-closed**, like the directory materialiser and for the same reason: launching

    """Drop a staging name that is a SECOND HARD LINK to the published signing key.

    Without this the hard-link refusal is a one-way door on a state the gateway's own
    publisher creates on purpose. ``token_secret`` publishes the key with ``os.link`` from
    a staged file and then unlinks the staged name; when the directory ``fsync`` after the
    link fails it deliberately KEEPS that name, as a recoverable second name to an inode
    whose only other name might not be durable yet, and a kill between the link and the
    unlink leaves the same shape. Either way ``token_signing.key`` has two names, the leaf
    is in :data:`_CREW_HARDLINK_REFUSED_LEAVES`, and every confined spawn then refuses --
    with no automatic way out, because the operator's only exit is to find and remove the
    name by hand.

    Reconciling is sound precisely BECAUSE the two names share an inode: the destination
    already resolves to the fully-written key, so the staged name carries no byte the
    destination does not. That identity is also the bound. A staged file from a publish
    still IN FLIGHT points at a different inode -- the key either does not exist yet or
    still names the previous one -- so a concurrent writer's temp is never touched.
    Anything that is not a regular file, and anything whose inode differs, is left alone.

    **The key's own directory entry is synced BEFORE the second name is dropped, and a
    sync the device refuses REFUSES the spawn.** Sharing an inode makes the second name
    redundant for reading, not for durability: the publisher keeps it exactly when
    ``fsync_dir`` on the key's parent failed, so at that moment the destination entry may
    not have reached the device and the staged name is the inode's one other reference. A
    crash after this function unlinked it, and before that entry commits, would leave the
    inode with no name at all -- the signing key gone and every dashboard session invalid.
    Syncing first is what makes dropping it lossless rather than probabilistic. Where a
    directory sync cannot be EXPRESSED (Windows has no directory descriptor, some network
    mounts reject it) ``fsync_dir`` returns quietly and the unlink proceeds, so the refusal
    is reserved for a device that actively refused the write -- a host whose storage is
    failing, where destroying the key's only durable name is the worse outcome.

    The sync runs only when a matching alias was actually found. A healthy home returns at
    the link-count test above, so this costs nothing on the ordinary spawn path.

    Runs BEFORE :func:`_refuse_aliased_masked_leaves`, which is the ordering this function
    exists to establish: cleanup that a refusal gates on must not sit behind it.

    A root, staging directory, or key it cannot open or stat is SKIPPED rather than
    escalated. Refusing here would fail every spawn for a layout that is merely unusual,
    and the refusal downstream still judges whatever link count survives.

    """Remove pre-upgrade signing-key staging temps left in the crew data-home root.

    The publisher stages inside :data:`_AUTH_STORE_STAGING_LEAF`, which is masked as a
    whole directory. A temp written before that directory existed sits in the data-home
    root instead, at a name no mask covers, holding the bytes that sign every dashboard
    token -- so on an upgraded host it stays readable by a same-uid agent indefinitely.
    Masking forward cannot reach it: the exposure is an artefact already on disk.

    Swept on every launch path, Linux namespace and macOS Seatbelt alike, and across every
    crew-home spelling rather than only the live one, for the reason
    :func:`_sweep_legacy_md_notebook_temps` gives: a Seatbelt profile denies named paths,
    never an arbitrary temp name, and a key already written under a rolled-back home stays
    readable whichever home is live now.

    Only regular files are removed, judged by ``lstat`` through a pinned descriptor so a
    link is never followed. A root that cannot be opened is skipped rather than escalated:
    skipping removes the deletion hazard entirely, while refusing would fail every spawn on
    a host whose layout is merely unusual. A file that matches and cannot be removed DOES
    refuse the spawn, naming the path -- launching would hand the agent the signing key.

    A match is only removed once it is known not to be the key inode's last name, because
    the pre-upgrade publisher kept exactly this name when its own directory sync failed:

    * the published key is ABSENT -- nothing is removed, and the condition is REPORTED.
      Whether this name is the inode's only one cannot be told apart from a staged write
      that never published, or from a file created inside a sandbox: a home the install does
      not use is masked by nothing while it is absent, so anything in it may be the governed
      process's own work. Removing risks destroying a key an operator can still recover by
      renaming it, and refusing would let one ``touch`` stop every launch on the host.
    * the published key is present and shares this inode -- ``fsync_dir`` on the root first,
      then remove. Sharing the inode means the key's own entry may not have reached the
      device yet, so this is the protocol
      :func:`_reconcile_auth_store_staging_links` uses for the same reason.
    * the published key is present with a different inode -- removed. It is an older or
      never-published staged copy, and the live key is reachable by its own name.

    A sync or an unlink this pass cannot perform REFUSES the spawn in the live data home and
    is reported elsewhere, for the reason
    :func:`_refuse_multilinked_credential_leaves` gives at length: the live home exists and
    is therefore masked, so nothing inside it was planted from a sandbox, while an unused
    home is neither.

    """The sensitive-dir list re-anchored under a pod child's REMAPPED home.

    Sibling of :func:`_relocated_crew_targets`, for the other root that moves.
    ``acp.client._apply_pod_home_remap`` gives a pod's kiro-cli child a pod-owned
    ``HOME`` (``KIROCREW_OS_HOME``) so its OAuth grants die with the pod, and
    ``pod.runtime._seed_pod_os_home`` mirrors the runtime's identity store into it
    (no host SSO cache contents are copied). Those are credentials, and every entry
    in the tier lists is ``$HOME``-relative joined
    against ``Path.home()`` -- the GATEWAY's home -- so none of them named the
    remapped tree and the seeded token sat in an UNMASKED location that the child's
    own ``$HOME`` resolves to.

    **Why this lives here rather than in the two ACP transports.** Both of them
    build their sandbox BEFORE applying the remap, so feeding the paths in through
    ``extra_hidden_dirs`` would need the call order changed in two places and the
    path set restated in both -- two independent copies of one rule, which is the
    duplication rounds 8 and 9 removed from the pinned-write path. Computing it
    inside the mask builder instead makes the mask correct for EVERY caller
    regardless of when the remap runs, and re-anchors whichever tier list the
    caller's mode selected rather than a hand-copied subset of it.

    Gated on ``KIROCREW_POD == "1"`` exactly as ``config.paths`` gates the
    resolver, so a non-pod session's mask is byte-identical to before. Returns only
    paths that DIFFER from the ``$HOME``-relative spelling, so the default layout
    gains no duplicate rule.

    ``normpath``, never ``realpath``, for the reason :func:`_relocated_crew_targets`
    records: this runs on the event loop for every async spawn. Never raises -- an
    unresolvable value yields nothing and the ``$HOME``-relative entries still apply.

    **One leaf is deliberately NOT re-anchored: the pod's own grant store.**
    ``<os-home>/.aws`` is where the pod's kiro-cli child writes its OWN MCP OAuth
    grants, which ``mcp_grant`` then stats through
    ``config.paths.kiro_oauth_cache_home``. No host SSO cache contents are staged
    into it -- ``_seed_pod_os_home`` creates ``.aws/sso/cache`` EMPTY, and the
    earlier revision that copied the operator's tokens there was deleted -- so what
    the tree holds is grants that pod itself minted. Bind-masking it empty still
    breaks the feature: the child's grant writes land in the overlay instead of the
    pod tree, so ``grant_presence`` answers "no grant" forever. A read-only per-file
    re-expose (the ``expose_files`` primitive) cannot substitute, because the child
    needs WRITE access and the grant filenames are sha256 keys that do not exist
    until the child mints them -- there is nothing to enumerate at launcher-build
    time.

    What that costs, stated rather than implied: an agent tool call inside the pod
    can read the grants that pod minted. That is accepted here because it is
    strictly narrower than both baselines it replaces -- a pod child resolving the
    REAL ``~/.aws/sso/cache``, and a non-pod kiro-cli child is
    exposed the real credential homes by the standard tier for exactly this sign-in
    reason. The tree is created by the pod and reclaimed by ``pod down``.

    **A SECOND tree carries the same residual, and it is host-derived rather than
    pod-minted: the staged identity store.** ``_seed_pod_os_home`` snapshots the
    runtime identity store (``.local/share/{kiro-cli,amazon-q}`` and the platform
    siblings, from ``identity_stores.store_mappings``) into the pod home, because
    that is where the harness resolves its access token and a pod with no copy boots
    signed-out. Those rows are absent from every masking tier ON PURPOSE --
    ``test_the_agent_runtime_auth_stores_stay_visible`` pins them out, because the
    harness is itself spawned inside this sandbox -- so this function emits nothing
    for them and an agent shell descendant can read the staged bearer token.

    That is NOT closed here, and the reason is structural rather than an oversight:
    a bind-mask acts on a MOUNT NAMESPACE, and the harness and the tool subprocesses
    it spawns share one. Hiding the store from the agent's shell hides it from
    kiro-cli in the same act, which is the auth break the tier exclusion exists to
    avoid. Crew owns no seam between the two audiences -- it wraps the harness, and
    the harness spawns its own tools inside that wrapper. The layer that DOES
    separate them is the tool gate: ``security.is_sensitive_path`` refuses every
    staged store path (``identity_stores.fenced_home_dirs`` is spliced into
    ``_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`` and re-anchored under ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME``), so a
    tool call naming the path is denied and only a raw ``open()`` inside a spawned
    shell reaches it.

    **The command matcher is not a second opinion on this, for ANY path.**
    ``is_sensitive_bash_command`` carries a size ceiling, an IMDS check and an
    environment-credential exfiltration check, and no path matcher at all.
    Measured, it answers ALLOW for every path spelling -- ``~/.aws/credentials``
    and ``~/.ssh/id_rsa`` included -- so the pod tree is not a special case
    there. What bounds a shell is this mask and nothing else, which is
    exactly why the carve-outs above are the interesting part of this function.

    Pinned in both directions by
    ``test_pod_runtime_auth_store.py::TestTheStagedStoresResidualIsPinned``; closing
    the staged store's shell leg needs a pod-scoped sign-in that never places a host
    bearer in the pod tree, which is a design change rather than a mask entry.

    The file-credential leg stays closed: ``.aws/config`` and ``.aws/credentials``
    are re-anchored EXPLICITLY, so the profile files whose pass-through
    ``acp.client._apply_pod_home_remap`` deleted cannot resolve inside the pod home
    either. Every other leaf in the tier is re-anchored unchanged.

def classify_declared_temp_path(path: str) -> "DeclaredTempRefusal | None":
    """Why a spec-declared temp *path* is refused, or ``None`` when it may be honored.

    The cause matters to the caller because only ``"sealed"`` describes a
    path inside ``<data home>/run``: an ``"unclassifiable"`` refusal is about a
    path whose canonical form could not be established, and a diagnostic that
    called it sealed would send an operator looking in the wrong place. Every
    cause gets the same response -- stop honoring the path.

    The question a caller must ask BEFORE it hands a sandboxed child a directory
    that came from config text. ``<data home>/run`` is sealed read-only
    on both backends, so a spec-declared ``TMPDIR`` under it silently gives the
    child a temp dir it cannot write -- and the write carve-out is not the answer:
    ``extra_writable_dirs`` is validated for SELF-DERIVED scratch paths only, so
    pointing it at spec text would hand untrusted config a write window under
    ``run``. A caller that gets a refusal cause must therefore stop honoring the
    path, not try to open it.

    Relative declarations are ``"unclassifiable"`` because the daemon and the
    spawned child do not share a required working directory. The classifier
    would resolve one against the daemon's cwd while ``spawn_backend`` runs the
    child under ``work_dir``. Refusing the spelling is the only way to keep one
    decision valid at every spawn boundary.

    Windows: nothing else to refuse, so ``None`` for every absolute path. Kiro Crew has no
    native Windows sandbox backend (see the delegation note in
    :func:`wrap_argv`): a probe child there is either not spawned at all or runs
    unsandboxed with a writable ``run``, so a declared temp under it is
    writable and is honored exactly as it was before this check existed. Gating
    here rather than resolving is also what keeps the check local -- on Windows
    ``realpath`` and ``stat`` OPEN the path, so classifying untrusted config
    text there would mean opening whatever it names.

    Both spellings are tested because the data home may be a supported symlink
    and path-based rules see each spelling independently. Spelling is only the
    fast answer: :func:`_identity_within_sealed_parent` then asks the filesystem
    itself, so a case, firmlink, or normalization alias of the seal cannot walk
    past this predicate.

#  - PYTHONPYCACHEPREFIX: the packaged desktop app exports it at

#    out of the signed bundle. Inherited into the agent subtree, every foreign
#    interpreter (uv-managed pythons, ephemeral venvs the agent's bash spawns)
#    mirrors its whole stdlib + site-packages under the crew home instead of
#    writing ``__pycache__`` beside its own sources; each ephemeral root mints
#    a fresh path-keyed mirror, so the cache grows without bound (multi-GB per
#    day under heavy subagent use). ``pycache_gc.prune_pycache`` bounds what
#    the gateway's own tree still writes there.
#  - PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE: the packaged macOS app exports it instead of the
#    prefix (its tree ships fully precompiled, see gateway-env.js), so the
#    bundled interpreter never writes into the sealed .app. It is a statement
#    about OUR bundle, not about the user's Python: inherited by a foreign
#    interpreter it silently disables bytecode caching for the user's own
#    projects -- pytest's assertion rewriter falls back to rewriting in memory
#    on every run, for one -- which is a slowdown nobody asked for and would
#    struggle to attribute to the desktop app.

    exactly that: its ``PeriodicExportingMetricReader`` registers an
    ``after_in_child`` hook that restarts its exporter thread in every child.

    Used ONLY to explain an EINVAL, never to reclassify one. EINVAL is genuinely
    ambiguous here -- a kernel built without ``CONFIG_USER_NS`` returns it too, and a
    multithreaded child cannot tell the two apart, because it never gets far enough to
    ask. Calling it transient would be just as wrong as calling it permanent, and it
    would additionally withhold the ``no_backend`` opt-in (``sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec``)
    from a host that really has no user namespaces. So the classification stays exactly
    as it was and the REASON names the thread, which is the part a reader cannot infer:
    a bare "errno 22 (EINVAL)" sends them to check their kernel config, which is the
    wrong place. Making such a process probe successfully needs a single-threaded
    child, i.e. a different spawn mechanism, and that is its own change.

    ``st_nlink`` of ``/proc/self/task`` is ``2 + threads`` (each thread is a
    subdirectory), so this is one ``stat`` and no list: the probe child of a threaded
    process must not allocate, because another thread may have owned the allocator lock
    at fork time and does not exist in the child to release it. Linux-only, like the
    rest of the probe.

#:
#: WHY A FRESH PROCESS. ``unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`` implies ``CLONE_THREAD`` and the
#: kernel refuses it with EINVAL unless the caller's thread group holds exactly one
#: task. A fork child inherits that condition: ``os.register_at_fork`` handlers run
#: INSIDE ``os.fork()`` before it returns, so a dependency that restarts a thread in
#: every child -- OpenTelemetry's ``PeriodicExportingMetricReader`` does exactly
#: this -- makes the child multithreaded before the probe can measure anything. The
#: verdict is then EINVAL, which is classified permanent and cached, and every later
#: sandboxed spawn on that process fails closed. A release gate lost 40 tests to one
#: such probe: all of them pass alone, none of them is a metrics test.
#:
#: A fresh interpreter starts single-threaded and runs no after-in-child fork hooks,
#: so its thread count at ``unshare()`` time is 1 regardless of the caller. This does
#: NOT soften the fail-closed rule: a genuinely single-threaded process that still
#: gets EINVAL means the host lacks ``CONFIG_USER_NS``, which stays permanent. It
#: removes the FALSE EINVAL, not the real one.
#:
#: It is also the more faithful probe. The real launcher is already a fresh
#: interpreter -- ``wrap_argv`` returns ``[sys.executable, launcher_path, ...]`` --
#: which then forks and unshares. So the fork-based probe was strictly MORE
#: pessimistic than the spawn it predicts, and this makes the two agree.
#:
#: Kept deliberately free of ``kiro_crew`` imports and run under ``-I -S``, like
#: ``_SPAWN_SHIM_CODE``: no site directory, no ``PYTHON*`` environment influence,

    Its child can be made multithreaded by an ``os.register_at_fork`` handler, which
    is why :func:`_probe_unshare_via_spawn` is preferred whenever it is available.

    Mirrors the sequence ``_build_launcher_script()`` actually performs — fork,
    child ``unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)``, parent writes the identity UID/GID map,
    child ``unshare(CLONE_NEWNS)``, child ``mount(MS_REC|MS_PRIVATE)`` on ``/``
    — because the steps do NOT behave the same way when combined or skipped. A
    single ``unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER | CLONE_NEWNS)`` is satisfied atomically and
    therefore SUCCEEDS on hosts where the split sequence fails: with Ubuntu's
    ``kernel.apparmor_restrict_unprivileged_userns = 1`` (the default since
    23.10), creating a user namespace moves the process into a restricted
    AppArmor profile carrying no CAP_SYS_ADMIN, so the *second* unshare returns
    EPERM. The previous combined probe reported those hosts as sandbox-capable
    and every real spawn then died with ``sandbox: unshare(NEWNS) failed: errno
    1``. The propagation mount is the same story one step later: a container
    under its runtime's default AppArmor profile passes both unshares and
    refuses the mount with EACCES, and a probe that stopped at the unshares
    reported it sandbox-capable too.

    ``reason`` names the failing step so a caller can tell the mechanisms apart
    — a NEWNS denial is the AppArmor userns restriction, NEWUSER with
    ENOSPC/EUSERS is ``user.max_user_namespaces=0``, and a mount denial is the
    container runtime's policy — rather than reporting a bare errno that fits
    all of them.

    collapsed anyway. The case that needs it is the DEFAULT home under a ``HOME``

    ``config.paths``.

    A function rather than a constant because it reads the live data home, and a NAMED one
    rather than two spellings of ``config_dir() / "run"`` because the writer and the
    recogniser have to agree about it exactly. The launcher's other three shape values are
    plain module constants, so the gate imports those directly instead.

    Deliberately only the PREFERRED spelling. ``_ensure_run_dir`` degrades to the system
    tmpdir when this directory cannot be created or chmod'd, and that directory is shared

    path would let a path anyone can write decide which process trees are reclaimable.
    RESIDUAL, stated rather than closed: on a host where the crew ``run/`` directory
    cannot be created, a sandboxed agent root is not recognised and its tracking entry is
    retained instead of reaped, exactly as it was before the gate learned this shape.
    Closing that needs identity the tmpdir path cannot supply.

    This is also the only part of the launcher's shape that touches the filesystem:
    ``config_dir()`` creates the data home if it is missing and can raise, so the gate

    needs that one directory writable — the MCP probe's ``TMPDIR`` lives at
    ``run/mcp-tmp/<probe>`` and a Bun-packaged server must extract its native
    module there before it can answer the handshake. Everything else stays
    sealed.

    Both sandbox backends apply the carve-out with override semantics (Seatbelt
    is last-match-wins; the Linux launcher remounts a fresh bind read-write), so
    an unvalidated path here would re-open whatever it covers. Each candidate is
    therefore checked, in BOTH its lexical and canonical spelling (the data home
    may be a supported symlink, and path-based rules see each spelling
    independently), against every seal the profile emits:

    * it must lie inside a ``carveable_parents`` entry — the runtime parent's
      write-only seal is the ONLY seal this parameter may punch through;
    * no guard (``subtree_guards`` — read-hidden trees, read-only ceilings,
      the voice runtime — or ``literal_guards`` — sealed single files, rename
      guards) may equal the carve-out or live inside it, since the override
      would re-open that guard;
    * it may not sit inside a non-carveable subtree guard, so a read-hidden
      tree can never grow a writable window.

    A candidate that fails any check is SKIPPED with a security warning rather
    than raising: the callers treat temp containment as fail-open hygiene, and
    a refused carve-out degrades to today's sealed behavior instead of blocking
    the spawn. Returns the deduplicated approved spellings.

    Two scope notes. Comparisons are LEXICAL and case-sensitive: on a
    case-insensitive filesystem (default APFS) a differently-cased spelling of
    a guard would not match, so this validator is a backstop for the
    self-derived paths its callers pass — paths whose case matches the emitted
    rules by construction — not a boundary for hostile input, which must never
    reach this parameter. And the ``realpath``/``isdir`` calls here are safe
    despite the no-filesystem-IO-on-the-event-loop rule the profile builders
    cite: every async caller reaches those builders through
    ``shielded_prepare_off_loop``'s worker thread.

    a requested ``off`` back up, and the audit-or-deny step can refuse a
    delegation after it was chosen. A second copy of that reasoning would answer
    differently from the wrap on exactly the hosts where the answer matters. The
    argv is the wrap's own record of what it did.

    Keys on the two things only Crew's wrappers put in an argv -- the
    ``KIROCREW_SANDBOX_ACTIVE`` env assignment the macOS seatbelt wrap prepends,
    and the generated launcher script the Linux namespace wrap execs. The
    delegated and unconfined paths add neither (they prepend at most ``env -u``
    scrub flags), so this is False for both, which is the point: on those paths
    the only sandbox left in the chain belongs to the harness.

    **The switch that turns a layer OFF is emitted only on a CORROBORATED
    verdict**, and that is the whole shape of this function. The signature that
    reaches the caller is the dead child's own stderr, and that child is the
    unverified binary the sandbox exists to contain: a planted one can print any
    line it likes. A message that answered it with "run
    ``kirocrew config set agent.sandbox off``" would let that binary talk the
    operator into removing the isolation it is running under -- the same hazard
    :func:`launcher_refusal` states for its own callers, answered the same way it
    prescribes. *corroborated* must therefore come from
    :func:`corroborate_launcher_refusal` (a real launcher run around a trusted
    no-op, whose stderr no child wrote), never from the child's text.

    Uncorroborated, the message still names the layer -- that comes from the argv
    Kiro Crew itself built, not from the child -- and routes the operator to the
    check that can reach a verdict, which is where the switch lives.

    Corroboration exists for Crew's Linux launcher only. On macOS the probe
    validates an ``(allow default)`` profile against a fixed system binary while
    the real wrap applies the strict generated one, so a passing probe is not
    evidence that the real wrap works and the uncorroborated branch is the honest
    answer there. Closing that gap is the real-wrap self-test, tracked separately.

    It follows that the HARNESS layer never gets a switch from here at all, whatever
    *corroborated* says: the only trusted run available speaks to Crew's launcher,
    so treating its verdict as evidence about the harness's own sandbox would be a

    SEALED target writable, or ``None`` when it may proceed.

    Two targets, one guard. Both seals are rules of Kiro Crew's OWN launcher: the
    kiro agents tree (:func:`_resolved_kiro_agents_targets`), whose fork and
    template specs decide what the next spawn may do, and the strict no-alias
    config leaf (``cloud.json``), which names the container image a Fargate launch
    runs and therefore the image the task's execution role hands the model
    credential to.

    A spawn delegated to kiro-cli's internal sandbox (macOS with that sandbox
    enabled, every first-party Windows spawn) never passes through that launcher,
    and the delegated sandbox treats the workspace as writable — so a workspace
    that IS, CONTAINS or sits INSIDE either target lets the child rewrite it.
    Refusing here, before the spawn, is the only enforcement point left on those
    paths. Where Kiro Crew's launcher does wrap the child both seals hold
    regardless of workspace, so this returns ``None`` and keeps ``$HOME``-rooted
    workspaces working there.

    Deliberately NOT conditioned on what the config currently CONTAINS. An agent
    does not need to swap a field it can create: given a writable path and no
    Fargate block, it writes a complete one and the owner's next launch runs the
    image it chose. A rule that reads the file's contents has that hole whatever
    the contents are, because the contents are what the attacker supplies.

    Same three-layer comparison as :func:`assert_voice_runtime_outside_agent_workspace`:
    the lexical spelling AND the canonical (``realpath``) spelling of both sides,
    then filesystem identity (``st_dev``/``st_ino``) walked along each side's
    ancestor chain — so a symlinked or junctioned workspace that resolves into
    the agents tree (or that the agents tree resolves into) is caught, not just
    the spelling the caller configured. Runs off the event loop (it stats). A

    Passing the configured value is what keeps a one-shot read from being

    The interactive ACP spawns already thread the configured mode through their
    ``sandbox_mode`` constructor argument. The one-shot ``kiro-cli`` reads

    The generic "install a sandbox backend, or opt out" advice is actively

    a backend exists and is one AppArmor profile away from working. Worse, the
    only concrete thing that text suggests is the opt-out, which turns off the
    isolation the message exists to protect.

    The remedy differs by HOW Kiro Crew was launched, so it is named per shape:

    * AppImage / desktop app — nothing applies a profile to a directly launched
      binary, so attach one to it (``kirocrew sandbox install-profile``).
    * anything else on such a host — the profile must be applied by systemd
      (``kirocrew service install``), because the only executable in a foreground
      launch is a shared interpreter and attaching there would grant unprivileged
      userns to every Python process on the machine.

    Deliberately does NOT tell the user to set the sysctl to 0: that trades a
    kernel-wide protection for one app's need, and the per-application profile
    exists so they do not have to.

    The ``sandbox_allow_unsandboxed_exec`` opt-out is still named in every case,
    because it is the documented escape hatch and withholding it would leave a

    * A refusal about HOST STATE is NOT a sandbox failure at all — a hardlinked

    trusted no-op (``true``), under the refused spawn's own ``mode`` and
    hidden/visible dirs, and classifying THAT run's own stderr -- text no child
    wrote.

    Running the whole launcher (not the boot probe) is what makes this cover
    EVERY launcher step. The probe mirrors only the first three -- the two
    unshares and the propagation mount -- so a policy that refused a LATER step
    (a hiding bind mount, ``NO_NEW_PRIVS``, the seccomp-BPF install) left the
    probe building the sandbox while every real spawn died, and the refusal was
    reported as ``installed=False``. The no-op runs every step, so its stderr

    * No launcher line in *output*: ``None``, nothing run.
    * Off Linux: ``None``, nothing run. The prefixes are the Linux launcher's,
      so elsewhere a matching line can only be the child's own text.
    * No trusted ``true`` on the host: ``None`` -- nothing safe to run.
    * The sandbox cannot even be built for the no-op: the pre-spawn
      :class:`SandboxUnavailableError`'s own ``(kind, detail, remedy)``.
    * The no-op run times out: ``None``.
    * The no-op run exits 0: ``None``. The candidate's line was forged, or the

      child's own complaint, never as a sandbox verdict.
    * The no-op run exits non-zero: :func:`launcher_refusal` of ITS stderr -- a
      real launcher refusal classified into the triple, or ``None`` when that
      trusted line is host state (a hardlinked credential) rather than a sandbox
      failure.

    The candidate's own text can never become the verdict on any branch. The

            basename. ``None`` retains basename detection for other callers.
            Windows internal-sandbox delegation requires this to be exactly

    # container image a Fargate launch runs, and the task's execution role hands the model
    # credential to it. The check reads no file contents, so it needs no knowledge of which
    # layer owns isolation and there is no encoding to bypass. Absent leaves cost nothing:
    # `_warn_if_alias_backed` returns when the lstat fails.

    This is the parent-side equivalent of the OS launchers' sensitive-variable
    removal plus ``strip_python_env=True``. It is mandatory for Windows Kiro
    delegation because Windows cannot express the POSIX ``env -u`` prefix, and
    keeping it on every platform makes delegated and wrapped ACP spawns inherit
    the same environment policy.

    This is the AGENT enforcement point, so the SSH_AUTH_SOCK
    forward opt-in is applied HERE rather than in the generic :func:`scrub_env`,
    which also serves non-agent callers (tailscale host children,
    ``sandboxed_spawn_argv`` spawns) that must keep the socket scrubbed. The
    decision is passed in as an already-resolved boolean (the caller resolves
    :func:`_forward_ssh_auth_sock` once in its off-loop environment-prep hop, so
    no synchronous config read runs on the asyncio event loop here); it defaults
    False, so a caller that does not opt in scrubs the socket as before. When
    set, the socket value is preserved across the scrub for the agent child
    alone.

    ``push_verdict_activation`` is threaded the SAME way: the ACP caller resolves
    the push-verdict activation mask off-loop (``not gateway_publish and
    _push_verdict_masks_ssh()``, an agent spawn is never ``gateway_publish``) and
    passes the resolved boolean in, so this on-loop enforcement point does not
    read config synchronously. When set, the ``GH_TOKEN`` / ``GITHUB_TOKEN``
    HTTPS-publish token env is withheld from the delegated child, matching the
    Linux launcher and the macOS seatbelt ``env -u`` set: on an activated install
    a Windows-delegated (or otherwise parent-scrubbed) agent subprocess otherwise
    keeps the token and authenticates a ``git push`` over HTTPS past the argv
    floor. It defaults False, so the gateway-owned publish and every non-activated
    or non-agent caller keep the token as before.

    When set it ALSO neutralizes the git credential HELPER: a configured
    ``credential.helper`` backed by the OS keychain (macOS), libsecret (Linux),
    git-credential-manager, or a ``store --file`` is a program git RUNS, so it
    sits outside the file/env mask -- an opaque agent ``git push`` over HTTPS
    still gets a credential from it. There is no ``env -u`` or launcher child on
    the Windows delegation path to disable it, so it is disabled HERE by SETTING
    an empty ``credential.helper`` via ``GIT_CONFIG_*`` in the returned env: git
    (>= 2.9) treats an empty helper value as resetting the helper list, we add no
    helper after it, and ``GIT_CONFIG_*`` is git's highest-precedence config
    source, inherited by the git processes git starts. The pair is APPENDED to any
    inherited ``GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`` in the source env so an existing env-config set
    is extended, not clobbered. The gateway-owned publish keeps its helper (its
    caller resolves ``push_verdict_activation`` False).

    When set it ALSO removes every SSH identity from the child's git-over-SSH by
    setting ``GIT_SSH_COMMAND`` to
    ``<ssh> -F none -o IdentitiesOnly=yes -o IdentityFile=none -o IdentityAgent=none``.
    The POSIX SSH mask (the ``SSH_AUTH_SOCK`` scrub plus launcher/OS filesystem
    masks) is POSIX-only, but the Windows delegation path has no launcher and no
    OS sandbox, and Windows OpenSSH both loads default disk keys (``~/.ssh/id_*``)
    and holds an agent key behind a FIXED named pipe
    (``\\\\.\\pipe\\openssh-ssh-agent``) the client consults by default regardless
    of ``SSH_AUTH_SOCK`` -- so an env scrub, or disabling only the agent, cannot
    remove disk identities. Per ``ssh_config(5)`` ``-F none`` ignores the user ssh
    config, ``IdentitiesOnly=yes`` restricts ssh to command-line identities (none
    are given), ``IdentityFile=none`` disables the default identity files, and
    ``IdentityAgent=none`` disables any agent -- so the child presents NO identity
    from any transport. The command is a TRUSTED, literal ``ssh``: an inherited
    ``GIT_SSH_COMMAND`` is NOT preserved, because a hostile wrapper need not forward
    the appended options to a real ssh and could authenticate from its own identity.
    The gateway-owned publish (mask False) keeps agent access.

    """Single chokepoint for agent-influenced subprocess spawns.

    Wraps *argv* with the OS-level sandbox (:func:`wrap_argv`) AND returns a
    credential-scrubbed environment (:func:`scrub_env`), so every caller gets
    both the filesystem-isolation and the environment-hiding layer without
    having to remember to apply each separately. This is the wrapper the
    subprocess-spawn audit test (``test/test_spawn_audit.py``) requires every
    agent-influenced spawn in ``src/kiro_crew`` to route through.

    Args:
        argv: Original command + args.
        mode: Sandbox mode passed to :func:`wrap_argv` (default ``"standard"``:
            hides non-workflow credential dirs while leaving git-over-SSH and
            the AWS CLI usable).
        env: Base environment to scrub (default ``os.environ``). Pass a
            pre-augmented env (e.g. with a resolved ``PATH``) to have the scrub
            applied on top of it.
        strip_python_env: Strip ``PYTHONPATH``/``PYTHONHOME`` so a foreign
            Python child does not inherit KiroCrew's interpreter paths. Applied
            BOTH inside :func:`wrap_argv`'s launcher AND to the returned env, so
            the strip holds even on the fail-open path where no launcher runs.
        extra_hidden_dirs: Additional absolute directory trees the caller needs
            hidden in both the macOS Seatbelt and Linux namespace profiles.
        extra_visible_dirs: Trusted paths that must remain visible when an
            otherwise-hidden parent contains them (the whole parent's mask is lifted).
        gateway_publish: Threaded to :func:`wrap_argv`. Marks the ONE gateway-owned
            operation that keeps ``~/.ssh`` on a push-verdict-activated install so it
            can publish; every agent-influenced spawn leaves it False and loses the key
            on such an install. Only the gateway publish path passes True.
        extra_private_dirs: The spawn's OWN directories inside a hidden tree
            (its ``agent_scratch`` dir under the masked scratch root). Re-exposed
            read-write as a window; the parent's mask and every sibling stay hidden.
        extra_writable_dirs: Self-derived scratch directories inside the sealed
            runtime parent that the child must be able to write — see
            :func:`wrap_argv`. Validated; refused candidates degrade to the
            sealed behavior rather than blocking the spawn.
        is_kiro_cli: Threaded to :func:`wrap_argv`. Whether the child carries
            its own internal sandbox, which cannot nest inside Crew's. Exposed
            here so a DELEGATING spawn can route through this chokepoint instead
            of calling :func:`wrap_argv` directly: without it, such a caller had
            to choose between the chokepoint (and silently lose the delegation
            decision, asking for a tier the child cannot honour) and its own
            hand-rolled wrap+scrub+scope (and drift from the contract every other
            spawn gets). ``None`` keeps ``wrap_argv``'s own classification.
        first_party_fixed_argv: Threaded to :func:`wrap_argv`. True ONLY for
            spawns whose full argv is derived inside this package with zero
            agent/repo/user-config influence; every passing site must be
            allowlisted in ``test/test_spawn_audit.py::FIRST_PARTY_SPAWNS``.
            See :func:`wrap_argv` for the no-backend carve-out it gates.

    Returns:
        ``(wrapped_argv, scrubbed_env, cleanup_path_or_None)``. The caller MUST
        pass *scrubbed_env* as the subprocess ``env=`` and unlink *cleanup_path*
        (a temp launcher/profile) after the child exits.

    ``(wrapped_argv, scrubbed_env, cleanup_path_or_None)`` where the third element
    is a temp launcher/profile the CALLER must unlink after the child exits.

    Every async caller reaches the sync chokepoint through a worker hop.
    Cancelling that hop abandons the returned tuple while the worker still
    materializes the launcher/profile, leaking the temp file forever.  Shielding
    the hop keeps the worker's result recoverable: on cancellation we wait for
    the thread to settle, unlink the launcher it created, and re-raise.

    A REPEAT cancellation landing on a bare recovery ``await`` is a
    ``BaseException`` that would abandon the recovery before the unlink runs,
    leaking the materialized launcher.  The settle-then-unlink therefore
    runs as its own task, shielded from cancellations aimed at this caller; each
    absorbed repeat is ``uncancel()``-ed so an enclosing ``asyncio.timeout``
    still reports ``TimeoutError``, and the ORIGINAL cancellation is re-raised

    ``executor`` keeps pool choice with the CALLER, because which pool absorbs a
    wedged preparation is per-site policy, not a shield concern: the chokepoint
    can cold-probe the sandbox backend with a synchronous subprocess, and

    a probe cannot occupy the workers another subsystem (the orphan-reaping

# RLIMIT is the wrong tool for the headline threats: RLIMIT_NPROC is
# per-real-UID (not per-spawn-subtree) and RLIMIT_AS caps virtual not resident
# memory. cgroup v2 pids.max / memory.max are the correct per-cgroup ceilings —
# they bound the agent + all its MCP-server/tool descendants as one unit, and
# the kernel enforces at fork()/alloc time (no reaper race). We place each
# agent-influenced spawn in a transient systemd --user --scope, which works
# UNPRIVILEGED when the user session has cgroup v2 delegation (pids + memory
# controllers). See docs/architecture/resource-protection.md.

# Default cgroup ceilings (per agent scope). Overridable via the same
# ``resource_limits`` config block used by apply_resource_limits.

# while the host is idle); 8192 still bounds fork bombs which spawn tens of
# thousands of tasks near-instantly. Override via resource_limits.max_processes.

# CPUWeight — proportional CPU share for agent scopes (systemd default is 100).
# Setting 50 makes agent scopes yield to interactive work under CPU contention

# leaves headroom for the OS + gateway — it is NOT an aggregate host guarantee
# across many concurrent scopes. It gives the agent real headroom on the 16–32
# GB machines this targets (16 GB → ~10.6 GB, 32 GB → ~21.3 GB) — where a flat

    (``resource_limits.max_cpu_percent``, off by default because hard quotas
    slow legitimate builds), so the spawned agent AND all its MCP-server/tool
    descendants are bounded as one cgroup and the kernel kills the scope on
    breach. ``--scope`` execs into the target (it does NOT fork a wrapper), so
    the returned argv's eventual PID is the real child — parent PID tracking,
    ``killpg``, and descendant scans are unaffected.

    Every scope is parented under a per-instance child of
    :data:`_CGROUP_AGENTS_SLICE` (see :func:`_agents_slice_name`, which explains
    why the owner has to be expressible), and the slice-level soft ceiling
    (``MemoryHigh``, see :func:`_ensure_agent_slice_memory_high`) — a
    host-derived constant (75% of RAM) — is ensured before each wrap on the
    PARENT, throttling the SUM of all concurrent agent trees before the slice's
    hard ``MemoryMax`` (:func:`ensure_agents_slice_limits`) OOM-kills a scope.
    cgroup v2 bounds a descendant by the minimum effective limit along its
    ancestor chain, so nesting one level deeper does not loosen either ceiling.

    Layers OUTSIDE the OS-level sandbox: callers pass the already-``wrap_argv``-ed
    argv here so the child is filesystem-isolated AND cgroup-bounded.

    The ceiling is per SPAWN, and therefore per agent RUNTIME rather than per
    SESSION: one process can serve several sessions (a parent and the subagents
    whose sessions are created on its runtime), and cgroup v2 kills a breaching
    scope as ONE unit, so every session on that runtime goes together. The
    per-scope values come from :func:`_cgroup_limits_from_config`, which is where
    a ceiling that scales with the number of sessions a runtime serves would
    attach -- it is the single place both the value and its config source are
    resolved, so a scaling factor applied there reaches every caller without any
    spawn site being taught about sessions.

    The scope itself is left ANONYMOUS here -- systemd auto-names it
    ``run-u<N>.scope``. A caller that can name the runtime it is spawning passes
    the result through :func:`name_scope_unit`, which is a separate step so that
    this function's argv stays byte-identical for the many callers wrapping a
    one-off tool or app subprocess that no reader needs to resolve back to a
    runtime.

    On a host without cgroup v2 delegation (older Linux, no systemd user
    session, macOS), returns *argv* unchanged and logs a one-time loud SECURITY
    warning — the RLIMIT_NOFILE preexec still applies, but the fork-bomb/memory
    DoS ceiling is NOT enforced there. The same degradation applies when
    ``systemd-run`` resolves outside the trusted system directories: prepending
    an unpinned wrapper name would trade a DoS ceiling for an exec-hijack
    channel, which is the worse of the two.

    The returned wrapper is an ABSOLUTE path, so callers may hand the result to

    * **Identity** (when *chdir_fd* is given) -- an absolute entry that IS the
      pinned directory, or lives anywhere beneath it, is dropped too.
      ``PATH=/home/me/.kiro/crew/workspace/bin:/usr/bin`` passes the lexical
      screen unchanged, yet a binary planted behind such an entry wins the
      child's own later lookup the moment the shim has entered the pinned
      directory. Entries are compared by ``(st_dev, st_ino)`` ancestry walked
      over descriptors -- never by pathname -- so a symlink or other alias of
      the pinned directory cannot dodge the screen. A kept entry is emitted as
      the OPENED descriptor's own canonical path, never the caller's spelling:
      the child re-resolves its ``PATH`` strings later, so a spelling that
      traverses a retargetable symlink could be pointed somewhere else between
      this screen and that lookup. An entry that cannot be opened, walked, or
      re-spelled is dropped, fail-closed per entry: an unopenable entry cannot
      contribute a resolvable binary today, and dropping is the direction that
      cannot be gamed by making a directory un-``stat``-able.

    When the BOUND descriptor's own identity cannot be read there is nothing to
    compare entries against, so the lexical screen stands alone for that spawn.
    That is a deliberate degrade, not a silent fallback: in production
    ``chdir_fd`` always originates from a real opened directory descriptor, and
    one that cannot be ``fstat``-ed is one the shim's own ``fchdir`` rejects
    before any command runs.

    Dropping entries can leave ``PATH`` empty, and that is the intended outcome
    -- the resolve then raises ``FileNotFoundError`` exactly as an unresolvable
    command already did, rather than silently searching somewhere else.

    """``asyncio.create_subprocess_exec`` with resource limits applied post-exec.

    The drop-in replacement for ``create_subprocess_exec(..., preexec_fn=
    resource_limit_preexec())``. Every keyword argument is forwarded untouched
    except ``preexec_fn``, which this owns: passing one would reintroduce the fork
    hazard the shim exists to remove, so it is refused.

    The returned ``Process`` describes the command itself, not a wrapper -- the
    shim ``exec``s in place -- so ``pid``, ``returncode``, signal delivery, and
    ``platform_compat.kill_process_tree`` all behave as they did before.

    ``chdir_fd`` pins the child's working directory to a directory IDENTITY
    rather than to a name: the descriptor is inherited, the shim ``fchdir``s into
    it and closes it, and only then is the command exec'd. Callers pass it when a
    pathname re-resolved in the child could be retargeted between the check and
    the chdir. It is deliberately not spelled ``cwd="/dev/fd/<n>"`` -- that is a
    Linux-only trick, and macOS refuses ``chdir()`` on those entries (``EACCES`` or
    ``ENOTDIR`` depending on the OS version). It needs the shim, and is refused rather than quietly downgraded
    to ``cwd``'s pathname when the shim is missing: entering a name nobody
    re-verified would reopen the window the descriptor exists to close.

    Setting it also DROPS ``cwd`` from the spawn, since ``Popen`` would otherwise
    chdir that pathname in the fork child before the shim ever runs, and screens
    ``PATH`` by directory IDENTITY -- for the search that resolves a bare command
    name here AND for the child's own environment. Relative entries are dropped
    (``execvpe`` resolved them against the child's cwd, the directory this
    descriptor exists to distrust), and so is any absolute entry that is the
    pinned directory itself or lives beneath it, compared by ``(st_dev, st_ino)``
    ancestry rather than by pathname. Resolving ``argv[0]`` is not the last
    lookup that happens: the wrapper this spawns looks its own target up on
    ``PATH`` after the shim has entered that directory. ``PATH=.:/usr/bin`` --
    or the same directory spelled absolutely -- would otherwise exec a binary
    out of the agent's own workspace, ahead of the sandbox meant to contain it.

    A spawn landing while the launcher interpreter's install tree is being
    rebuilt is retried, on the same budget and by the same discriminator as
    :func:`popen_limited` -- this wrapper puts the same ``sys.executable`` at
    the head of the spawned argv, so it was exposed to the identical blip. The
    backoff uses ``asyncio.sleep``: a blocking sleep would freeze the event loop
    for up to ~3.75s, which is precisely the hazard this wrapper exists to
    avoid. Only the shim-prefixed spawn is retried -- the no-shim fallback below
    execs the caller's own ``argv[0]``, so an ENOENT there is the caller's own
    missing binary and must still surface on the first attempt.

    There is deliberately no ``abort_retry`` hook here, unlike
    :func:`popen_limited`: no caller mediates this wrapper's cancellation
    through a registry keyed on the live child, so the lost-cancel window that
    hook exists to close has no consumer. Add one when a caller needs it.

    Same contract as :func:`run_limited`, for callers that need the handle
    rather than the result -- a long-running child they will ``communicate()``
    with, poll, or signal later.

    The returned ``Popen`` is the command's own process, not a wrapper's, so
    ``pid``, ``returncode``, signal delivery, and
    ``platform_compat.kill_process_tree`` behave as they did before.

    ``Popen.args`` is reset to the command's own argv for the same reason
    :func:`run_limited` rewrites ``cmd``: ``communicate(timeout=...)`` builds its
    ``TimeoutExpired`` from ``self.args``, so leaving the shim there would put
    ~8 KB of shim source into the timeout message. Nothing in CPython reads
    ``self.args`` functionally -- only ``__repr__`` and that exception.

    A spawn that lands while the launcher interpreter's install tree is being
    rebuilt is retried rather than surfaced -- see
    :data:`_INTERPRETER_ENOENT_DELAYS`. The retry loop is INLINE rather than
    extracted into a helper on purpose: both spawn audits key on
    ``<relpath>::<enclosing function>``, so moving this ``Popen`` into its own
    function would migrate its key, stranding the ``popen_limited`` entries in
    ``_SYNC_ALLOWED`` and ``BENIGN_SPAWNS`` as stale while the relocated call read
    as a brand-new unrouted spawn.

    ``abort_retry`` is consulted after each backoff, and matters only to a caller
    whose cancellation is mediated by a REGISTRY keyed on the live child -- for
    those, the backoff is a window in which a cancel is silently LOST rather than
    merely delayed, because the canceller finds no registered child and records
    nothing, and the retry then launches work the caller already cancelled.
    Returning ``True`` re-raises the ENOENT instead of spawning, so the caller's
    own cancellation path reports the run rather than running it. A caller that
    holds the ``Popen`` handle itself and polls a stop flag (such as
    ``auto_improvement.spine.agent_runner``, which calls ``_terminate_group`` on
    the handle) loses nothing by omitting it: the stop is observed after the
    spawn returns and the child is signalled then.

# reclaim of the launcher's stale bind-mount sources lives in
# ``kiro_crew.sandbox_mount_sweep``. Every name that moved stays readable as
# ``kiro_crew.sandbox.<name>``, and every one of them is FORWARDED: ``__getattr__``
# reads it from its owner, and ``_ReExportModule`` sends a write or delete there, so a
# patch of ``kiro_crew.sandbox.<name>`` reaches the owner's own callers however the
# test spells it. A forwarded name is absent from this module's namespace on purpose --
# a binding here would shadow the owner for every later read -- and this module's code
# reads it as ``<owner>.<name>``.
#
# The builders read the plan they render from this module when they run, through a
# function-local import, so a test that rebinds a tier list or a target helper here
# reaches them as it did before the move.
