"""WorkflowRunner — execute a validated workflow script with ceilings + event stream.

Top of the layering (``dsl`` → ``context`` → ``runner``; GATE F1). Ties together:
validation (``validate``), the restricted namespace + ceilings (``context``), the
scheduling combinators (``dsl``), and the event stream (``events``).

Gates closed here:

* A7 — emits the full documented event stream (``run_started`` … ``run_finished`` /
  ``run_failed`` / ``run_cancelled``), in order, via ``EventStream``.
* B5 — a wall-clock timeout terminates a runaway script (``asyncio.wait``; see the
  comment at the guard for why NOT ``wait_for``). The ceiling is a backstop, not a
  data-loss event: every terminal path carries the per-agent results collected so
  far, and each call is checkpointed to the run record as it completes.
* (consumes A4/B6 from ``context``: ``Budget`` ceiling, ``AgentCounter`` cap.)

Agent execution is injected as ``agent_fn`` so the runner is testable against a
stub; production supplies ``agent_exec.build_agent_fn`` (a fresh isolated session
per call) or ``agent_pool.build_pooled_agent_fn`` (warm sessions). The runner never
spawns real ``kiro-cli`` — that is the caller's ``agent_fn``.

``now`` is a fixed run-start stamp supplied by the caller (NOT ``time`` inside the
script's scope) so the stream stays deterministic / resume-stable. ``time`` is used
here in the RUNNER (host code), only for the wall-clock guard and duration — never
exposed to the script.

Spec: ``docs/system-specs/modules/workflows.md``.
