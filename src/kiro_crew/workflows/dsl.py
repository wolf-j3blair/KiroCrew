"""Scheduling combinators for the dynamic-workflow DSL (GATES A3, A5).

``parallel`` and ``pipeline`` are the two scheduling primitives a workflow script
reaches through ``ctx``. They are pure ``asyncio`` combinators over caller-supplied
thunks / stage callables — they hold no agent, session, or gateway logic, so this
module sits at the BOTTOM of the layering (``dsl`` → ``context`` → ``runner``;
GATE F1) and imports nothing heavy. The runner injects the concurrency ``limit``
(the host's fixed workflow cap, normalized by :func:`bounded_limit`); tests pass
a small limit or ``None``.

Semantics (frozen — see ``docs/system-specs/modules/workflows.md``):

* ``parallel(tasks)`` — BARRIER. Run every task concurrently, await them all,
  return results in input order. Each task may be a zero-arg thunk
  (``lambda: ctx.agent(p)``) OR an already-created awaitable (``ctx.agent(p)``) —
  both are accepted, since authors naturally reach for the latter. A task that
  raises (synchronously or in its awaitable) resolves to ``None`` — the call
  itself NEVER raises (GATE A5), so callers ``.filter(None)``.

* ``pipeline(items, *stages)`` — NO barrier between stages. Each item flows through
  all stages in its own chain; item B can reach stage 2 while item A is still in
  stage 1 (GATE A3). Wall-clock = slowest single-item chain, not sum-of-slowest-
  per-stage. Each stage is called ``stage(prev, item, index)`` (arity-adapted: a
  1-arg stage just gets ``prev``); for stage 0 ``prev`` is the item itself. A stage
  that raises drops that item to ``None`` and skips its remaining stages. Results
  are returned in input order.
