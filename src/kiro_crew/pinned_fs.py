"""Descriptor-pinned filesystem staging: open once, then never trust a name again.

Every function here exists because guarding a path by NAME does not guard the open
that follows it. A name is validated, then re-opened, and in the window between the
two anything running as this user -- which in this product includes an agent -- can
swap the final component, or an ancestor DIRECTORY, for a link pointing somewhere
else. The validated path and the opened inode are then not the same thing.

The discipline is one sentence: resolve once, open once, and address everything
downstream through the descriptor you already hold. A descriptor cannot be
re-pointed, so a component that is open is fixed; a component reached by name is
not.

Why this module exists rather than a check at each call site: the
validated-by-name path uses are many and easy to miss one at a time -- source root,
each ancestor, each file, the destination tree, the pre-restore backup pass. The
mechanism belongs in one place with one set of invariants, and callers become thin
consumers of it.

``kiro_crew.eval.bench.safepath`` imports the mechanical half from here, so the
benchmark harness and the product share one set of invariants. The docstrings
explaining WHY each flag is load-bearing live with them.

Two things this module deliberately does NOT do:

* It holds no policy. It does not know which locations are protected, and it does
  not decide whether a refusal should abort a command or be reported and skipped.
  Callers pass their own refusal type (so an existing CLI error contract does not
  change) and their own ``on_skip`` reporter (so user-facing wording stays theirs).
* It does not silently substitute a weaker mechanism. Where a platform cannot pin
  (see :func:`supports_pinned_walk`), the caller is told so and decides; nothing
  here falls back to a by-name walk on its own.

    """Copy one file's bytes from a descriptor pinned to a validated inode.

    Returns True when bytes were copied, False when the source was skipped.

    ``skip_unreadable`` tolerates ONE failure: the SOURCE open being refused for
    permission, which is reported as ``SKIP_UNREADABLE_ENTRY`` and returns False.
    It is deliberately not a tolerance for the copy as a whole. A caller that
    wrapped this call instead could not tell the two ends apart, so a DESTINATION
    refusal was recorded as an unreadable source -- an omission attributed to the
    operator's data rather than to the failure to write it, in a bundle that then
    reported success and let retention prune a complete one. Only the end that was
    actually refused is knowable here, so the decision belongs here.

    ``expected_src_ident`` (when given) is the ``(st_dev, st_ino)`` a caller's
    own validation observed: the copy proceeds only when the pinned source
    descriptor fstats to exactly that inode, and reports
    ``SKIP_IDENTITY_CHANGED`` otherwise. This closes the validate->copy window
    the descriptor pin alone cannot: the pin proves the copied inode is the
    OPENED inode, not that it is the inode the caller judged — a hardlink
    swapped in at the name between validation and this open would be a regular
    single-link file the other gates accept.

    ``on_created`` (when given) receives the DESTINATION descriptor's ``fstat``
    at publish time — the identity witness for a caller that must re-open the
    copy by name later: matching ``(st_dev, st_ino)`` on that reopen proves it
    reached the inode this copy created, not a replacement swapped in at the
    same name between the copy and the reopen.

    ``max_bytes`` is a size ceiling enforced INSIDE the copy, not after it: the
    ``fstat`` size is checked before the destination is even created (a sparse
    file's logical size is what ``fstat`` reports, so a swapped-in sparse giant
    is refused before a byte lands), and the write loop aborts after the first
    excess byte for a source that grows between the ``fstat`` and the read.
    Both refusals report ``SKIP_TOO_LARGE`` and truncate whatever was written
    through the destination descriptor -- a ceiling checked only after the copy
    would let the copy itself exhaust the destination volume on the way to the
    rejection.

    ``shutil.copy2`` cannot be used on a user-writable tree: it dereferences a
    hardlink into innocent-looking regular bytes, and a later tar-level hardlink
    screen never sees a link to reject -- so a hardlink to a credential planted
    inside an otherwise allowlisted directory would ride along as plain content.
    The order here is open first, judge the DESCRIPTOR second: ``O_NOFOLLOW`` where
    the platform has it, then ``fstat`` on the fd, so the inode that is validated is
    exactly the inode whose bytes are copied and no check-to-use window remains.
    Mode and timestamps are applied from that same ``fstat`` result rather than from
    a fresh by-name stat.

    BOTH ends can be pinned, and on a destination the caller does not own they MUST
    be. Pass *dir_fd* + *name* for a pinned source and *dst_dir_fd* + *dst_name* for
    a pinned destination; each side falls back to the by-name form when its pair is
    absent, which is only appropriate for a path this process just created. A caller
    that already holds a validated source descriptor (an ``os.open`` followed by a
    ``fd_real_path`` witness check) passes it as *src_fd* instead — ownership
    transfers to this function, which closes it on every path — so the source is
    never re-opened by name; on Windows, which has no ``dir_fd`` support, that is
    the only pinned source form available. A
    destination reached by name is an ancestor swap away from landing the bytes
    somewhere else entirely -- a real gap in a by-name-only design, and it is why
    the by-name destination is now the
    exception rather than the only form.

    The destination is created with ``O_EXCL``, so anything already at that name is a
    planted link or alias rather than a file to overwrite and creation refuses it
    without a separate check. With *skip_existing* an occupied name is reported as
    skipped instead, which is what a merge that must not overwrite needs: exclusive
    creation makes "it did not exist" and "this call created it" one statement rather
    than two with a window between them.

    ``FileNotFoundError`` propagates so a caller can tolerate a source that vanished
    mid-walk; every other ``OSError`` propagates so real failures still abort.

    THE single no-follow file-publish path. Every by-name ``write_text`` /
    ``open(..., "w")`` on an agent-influenced path is a truncation primitive
    pointed at whatever the name currently resolves to: replace the target with a
    symlink to a host file and the next publish truncates that file instead. The
    same hole was closed once for a pod's SSO seeding and once for the systemd
    unit files, in two separate hand-rolled copies -- so this exists to make the
    third copy impossible rather than to add a fourth.

    Three properties, and the middle one is the portable half:

    * The PARENT is pinned through :func:`create_and_open_dir_pinned`, so no
      ancestor is re-resolved by name between the check and the write, and the
      write lands relative to that descriptor.
    * The target is ``lstat``-ed THROUGH that descriptor and refused when it is a
      symlink or not a regular file. ``os.stat(..., follow_symlinks=False)`` exists
      on every platform Python supports, so this check holds even where
      ``O_NOFOLLOW`` does not (see :func:`supports_pinned_walk`) -- which is what
      keeps the guarantee real on Windows rather than silently platform-gated.
    * The publish itself is ``atomic_write_at`` on the pinned descriptor, so the
      mode is applied to the temp before the payload is reachable under the final
      name and a reader never sees a partial file.

    Residual, stated rather than implied: a same-UID process can still swap the
    target between the ``lstat`` and the rename. Per the recorded pod threat model
    a pod is operational isolation, not protection from arbitrary same-UID
    processes; what this closes is the case where the ATTACKER-PLANTED name is
    followed, which needs no race at all.

    **What pinning means on Windows, decided rather than left to a crash.** The
    pinned walk needs ``O_DIRECTORY``, ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and ``os.open`` in
    ``os.supports_dir_fd`` -- exactly what :func:`supports_pinned_walk` probes, and
    none of which Windows has (``atomic_write_at``'s own docstring records that a
    pinned caller is on POSIX). So there the publish degrades to BY NAME, and the
    degradation is bounded and named:

    * KEPT everywhere: the ``lstat`` refusal of a symlink or non-regular target --
      the leg that stops a PLANTED name from being followed, which is the attack
      needing no race, and the everywhere-floor this function promises.
    * LOST on Windows: ancestor pinning, so an ancestor swapped between the check

    A by-name ``read_text`` on an agent-influenced path is a disclosure primitive
    pointed at whatever the name currently resolves to: replace the file with a
    symlink to a credential and the next read prints that credential under the
    original name's label. The write side of this exact path was already pinned;
    leaving the read by-name meant the same planted link still worked, just in the
    other direction (found in review on the pod refusal note, which
    ``kirocrew pod ls`` prints).

    Same two properties, same everywhere-floor as the write:

    * The PARENT is pinned via :func:`pin_parent`, so no ancestor is re-resolved
      by name between the check and the read.
    * The target is ``lstat``-ed THROUGH that descriptor and refused when it is a
      symlink or not a regular file. That check is portable, so it holds where
      ``O_NOFOLLOW`` does not.

    Windows degrades exactly as the write does: the ``lstat`` refusal of a
    non-regular target is KEPT (the leg that stops a PLANTED name from being
    followed, which needs no race), ancestor pinning is LOST, and no supported
    configuration relies on it because pods are systemd/launchd only.

    """Create a directory through its PINNED parent and return its descriptor.

    With *must_create* a name that already exists is REFUSED rather than accepted. Review
    found the hole that needs: a replace removes the live tree and stages the archive into
    its place, so if the gateway recreates that root in between, accepting it lets files
    the archive does not contain survive a "replace" that reports success. The children
    already refused a pre-existing name -- only the root was exempt, and this makes it
    consistent. Merge callers leave it false, because meeting an existing directory is
    what merging IS.

    It does NOT report whether our own `mkdir` created the directory, which would be
    the natural way to stamp the archive's mode and timestamps on only in that case.
    Such a flag cannot be trusted.

    Sampling `dst.exists()` beforehand is a name-based check with a window after it, and
    `mkdir` succeeding does not close that window either: the descriptor comes from a
    SEPARATE `open`, so a directory replaced between the two leaves the flag true while
    describing an object the caller does not hold -- and the archive's metadata then
    lands on somebody else's directory. Nothing repairs it: a stat taken after the
    `mkdir` observes the replacement just as happily, POSIX has no atomic
    create-and-open for a directory, and under a same-user threat model no mode trick
    helps. So the metadata is simply not applied to directories.

    ``Path(p).mkdir(parents=True)`` creates every missing component by name, so a link
    already sitting at an ancestor is followed and the directories are created inside
    whatever it points at -- a write through an attacker-controlled path, which is
    strictly worse than a read through one. Review flagged the by-name creation; the
    probe that settled it showed a link AT the final component is already refused by
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` but an ancestor link is not.

    So the parent chain is pinned first and only the final component is created,
    relative to that descriptor. What remains is this module's documented and
    deliberate residual, stated in :func:`pin_parent`: a component that was already a
    link when the parent was resolved is followed by that resolution, because refusing
    every symlinked ancestor would break a destination under ``/tmp`` on macOS. The
    parent must therefore already exist -- callers create their own tree roots.

    Creating the directory and opening it are two syscalls, and a removal landing
    between them is an interleaving no ordering closes. The pair is therefore
    re-attempted, :data:`_CREATE_ATTEMPTS` times, against the SAME pinned parent
    descriptor -- a retry resolves no name, so it cannot be steered anywhere the first
    attempt could not go, and ``must_create`` plus the ``O_NOFOLLOW`` refusal are both
    re-asked on every attempt. Tolerating only the ``FileExistsError`` half handled a
    concurrent writer and not a concurrent remover (GH-12043), and this is a caller
    that needs the directory: a snapshot's staging root, a restore destination, a pod
    home. Exhaustion, and a removal of the pinned PARENT (which no attempt can
    survive), raise ``FileNotFoundError`` carrying the whole path rather than the bare
    relative name ``openat`` was given.

    The re-attempt covers a directory THIS call created and no other. When the
    ``mkdir`` instead MET one that was already there -- the merge case, where
    ``must_create`` is false and the destination legitimately holds the caller's files
    -- a removal in the window is reported, not re-attempted: the contents are already
    unrecoverable, and re-creating the name would hand back an empty directory that an
    additive restore would stage into and report success over. Review caught that as
    the retry's one unsafe case, and it is why the loop tracks which of the two
    happened rather than retrying on the errno alone.

    tricks -- e.g. an art path already through a lexical gate) needs to reach the leaf

    containment check and the open every ancestor is swappable by a same-uid process
    when the tree is agent-writable. This is the multi-component generalisation of

    directory and creates only that one; this one starts from an already-open root and
    walks (optionally creating) a whole relative chain below it, refusing a link at
    EVERY component, the root included.

      component is ``mkdir``-ed ``dir_fd``-relative first, then opened the same way --
      the create tolerates an existing directory, the open still refuses a link that
      replaced it. Use it as ``dir_fd=`` for the leaf's own contents (``os.open`` a

      is closed on exit;
    * ``None`` on a platform that cannot pin (Windows: no ``dir_fd`` support). There
      the chain is validated by ``lstat`` -- the root and every component are refused
      when a symlink, a reparse point, or (with *create* off, or once created) a
      non-directory -- and, with *create*, a missing component is ``mkdir``-ed by name.
      The caller then addresses the leaf BY NAME (``root`` joined with
      *rel_dir_parts*), which is the same residual by-name posture
      :func:`write_file_pinned` and the removal helpers document for this platform:
      the ancestor-swap window between the ``lstat`` and the by-name use is not closed
      here because the platform cannot pin a directory at all, and no supported
      configuration relies on it. The ``lstat`` refusal of a PLANTED link -- the leg
      that needs no race -- is kept.

    Empty *rel_dir_parts* means the leaf IS *root*: the pinned arm yields *root*'s own
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` descriptor (a linked root is refused), and the by-name arm yields
    ``None`` after ``lstat``-refusing a linked root.

    Any refusal raises *refusal* (default :class:`PinnedPathRefusal`); a caller that
    prefers a soft outcome catches it. ``create=False`` plus a missing component is a
    refusal, not a create.

    """Copy a tree with BOTH traversals pinned end to end.

    A by-name walk's link screens protect only each final component: swapping an
    allowlisted ancestor DIRECTORY for a link to a credential directory mid-walk
    redirects every deeper open through the link, and the per-file ``O_NOFOLLOW``
    never fires because what it finds inside the replaced tree is a plain regular
    file. Here every directory is opened ``O_NOFOLLOW|O_DIRECTORY`` relative to its
    PARENT's descriptor and every file is opened relative to its pinned parent, so
    the directory that was validated is exactly the directory used. Both roots go
    through :func:`open_dir_pinned`, which pins the chain ABOVE each root too.

    The DESTINATION is pinned for a reason, not for symmetry. The first version of
    this function pinned only the source, which was defensible while the only
    destination was a private temporary directory -- and wrong the moment a restore
    used it, because then the destination IS the live data home and an ancestor
    swapped there lands the archive's bytes outside it. Caught in review.

    With *skip_existing* an occupied destination name is reported and skipped rather
    than refused, which is what a merge that must not overwrite needs. Without it an
    occupied name raises, because in a staging directory this process just created,
    the only thing that can be sitting there is something planted.

    Symlinks and non-regular files are reported through *on_skip* and skipped;
    entries that vanish mid-walk are reported and skipped; *ignore* sees
    ``(directory_by_name, contents)`` exactly as ``shutil.copytree``'s does. Every
    other error propagates, so a staging pass never silently ships without files it
    failed to read.

    *skip_unreadable* is the one exception, and it is off by default. With it, an
    entry whose metadata or bytes this process may not read is reported as
    ``SKIP_UNREADABLE_ENTRY`` and skipped -- a file, a directory whose open is
    refused, and the tree's own root alike, since a tolerance that covered only
    files still ended the operation on a directory. It belongs ONLY to a caller that records
    every skip somewhere the operator will read it: a data home can hold a
    platform-protected path that no retry will make readable, and ending the walk
    there leaves them with no backup at all instead of one that declares the gap. A
    RESTORE must never set it -- there the unreadable name is the archive's own
    content, so skipping it drops data the operator asked to have put back.

    Refuses outright on a platform that cannot pin a tree. Callers that must still
    function there are expected to say so explicitly rather than have this module
    quietly hand them a by-name walk -- see :func:`supports_pinned_tree_walk`.

    The answer to a validator that has judged a path by name and is about to resolve

    resolving a link aimed at a share is an outbound SMB authentication rather than a
    local lookup. This is the Windows mechanism, and it is the only one reached in
    production -- the sole caller, ``hooks.validate_file_path``, invokes it under
    ``os.name == "nt"`` -- so the walk is written for Windows, which has no ``openat``:

    Every component is opened by its full path with ``OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`` (see
    :func:`kiro_crew.platform_compat.open_entry_no_follow`), so a component that is
    already a link is opened AS the link and reported rather than traversed, and its
    link-ness is read off the HANDLE -- the one thing a name swap cannot exchange. The
    open asks for attribute-only access, so the walk does not pin a component against a
    concurrent rename or delete. It does not need to: the caller does not resolve the
    path by name afterwards, it resolves THROUGH the deepest held descriptor
    (:func:`fd_real_path`), whose final path names the inode the walk already proved. A
    junction swapped in after the walk changes a NAME, and the descriptor stays bound to
    the inode the walk proved rather than to the name -- so the resolution the hold hands
    back is immune to it.

    Stops at the first component that is a link (:data:`CHAIN_REPARSE`) or that holds
    nothing (:data:`CHAIN_MISSING`), and otherwise reaches the leaf
    (:data:`CHAIN_HELD`). A missing component ends the walk without refusing: the rest
    of the path names nothing, and a name that does not exist cannot redirect a
    resolution.

    Raises ``OSError`` for every other failure -- a permission denial, a sharing
    violation, an unreachable host -- so the caller fails closed on the one case where
    what is at that component is genuinely unknown. Refuses a path deeper than
    *max_depth* components for the reason the walk itself is bounded: one open per

    every LINK's key separately. Children are opened relative to the descriptor with
    ``O_NOFOLLOW``, so no path is resolved and a directory that is really a link is not
    descended into. The inodes come from the directory block itself
    (``os.DirEntry.inode``), so recording them costs no extra syscall.

    The inodes are the point. ``O_NOFOLLOW`` refuses a LINK, but a real directory RENAMED
    into a scanned name is not a link and satisfies ``O_DIRECTORY`` -- so moving a live
    directory onto a scanned directory's name redirects later unlinks at live files that
    happen to share a name, and pinning the ROOT does not cover that, because the root's
    own inode is unchanged by a rename inside it. Every directory a removal later opens
    must be the inode this scan recorded. A map read at removal time cannot serve: it
    reports the impostor.

    Refuses an entry on another ``device``, which is how a mount arriving underneath is
    caught: it is not a link either.

    ITERATIVE, with an explicit stack, because a recursive walk of a deeply nested tree
    raises ``RecursionError`` -- which is not ``OSError``, so it escapes callers that turn
    a failed read into a refusal.

    What it costs in descriptors, stated accurately because the obvious guess is wrong: a
    directory's child directories are ALL opened before any of them is visited, so what is
    held at once is the queued frontier, not the current path. A wide tree can therefore
    exhaust descriptors as easily as a deep one. Both surface as ``EMFILE`` -- an ``OSError``
    every caller here already treats as "cannot read this, keep it" -- so the failure is
    contained either way; only the arithmetic differs. Files and links cost nothing, which is
    what makes this bearable in practice: the trees this walks are wide in FILES and narrow
    in directories.

    Opening children eagerly is deliberate rather than incidental. Each child's inode is
    taken from the directory block and cross-checked against the ``fstat`` of the descriptor
    opened a moment later, and that pair is what catches a directory renamed into a scanned
    name between the listing and the open. Deferring the open until the child is visited
    would put every sibling's processing inside that window, trading a documented containment
    property for a descriptor bound. The bound is the thing worth giving up.

    Raises rather than returning a short list: this feeds decisions about deleting the only
    copy of something, so an incomplete answer must not read as "nothing unaccounted for".

    *expect* is ``(st_dev, st_ino)``. This is the single owner of rename-verify-remove.
    ``rmdir`` addresses a NAME and so does any check above it, so an actor with write
    access to the parent can swap the name between the two and have an unapproved
    directory removed on another one's approval. So:

    1. the name is renamed to ``.<name>.removing-<random>`` in the SAME parent, which is
       atomic and moves whatever holds the name somewhere only this call knows;
    2. the identity is re-checked THERE, through the parent descriptor, against *expect*;
    3. only that staging name is removed.

    The suffix is random because ``os.rename`` replaces an existing destination silently on
    POSIX: a predictable name is one that can be squatted.

    The rename BACK is the part that is easy to get wrong, so both halves are stated.

    On a MISMATCH it never happens: the object under the staging name is not the one that
    was approved, which means the name it came from is not this code's to write to either --
    and rename replaces its destination, so putting the impostor back would destroy whatever
    now answers to the original name.

    On a failed ``rmdir`` it happens only if the original name is FREE. It has to be put back
    where it can be found: this directory could not be removed because something is inside
    it, and that something is unaccounted-for content nobody listed -- leaving it under an
    unguessable name means nothing can point at it again. But POSIX rename REPLACES a
    directory destination when that destination is an empty directory, so renaming back
    blindly can silently remove one a concurrent writer created at the name. Checking the
    name is free first is a check-to-use pair, and this module says elsewhere that those are
    the mistake it exists to remove -- so what it does and does not buy is worth being exact
    about. There is no no-replace rename for directories in the stdlib (``renameat2``'s
    ``RENAME_NOREPLACE`` is Linux-only and unexposed), so the choice is between this and one
    of two unconditional losses. What the check removes is the DETERMINISTIC case, where
    something already holds the name by the time the removal fails; what is left is a race
    inside two adjacent syscalls whose worst outcome is an empty directory removed, which
    holds no data and is trivially remade. A name found occupied leaves the directory staged
    and reported.

    Never raises for these outcomes and never logs: the caller decides between
    log-and-continue and raise, and words the message. ``error`` carries the underlying
    ``OSError`` for a caller that re-raises.

    The undo half of "move an entry aside, remove the tree, put it back if the tree would
    not go". It has to be no-clobber: something may have arrived at *dst_name* while the
    entry was out, and that something is a file this code has never read.

    *src_name* is treated as UNTRUSTED, which is the part that is easy to skip. It is a name
    in a directory an actor may be able to write to, and the whole reason this function runs
    is that an earlier step already failed -- so time has passed. The name is opened
    ``O_NOFOLLOW | O_NONBLOCK``, screened for a regular file, and its inode checked against
    *expect_ino* before anything is read from it, and the copy reads that DESCRIPTOR rather
    than re-opening the name. Without ``O_NOFOLLOW``, a name swapped for a symbolic link is
    followed and whatever it points at -- a credential, say -- is linked or copied into the
    destination under a name the caller will treat as its own. ``O_NOFOLLOW`` alone is not
    enough: it does not refuse a FIFO, and opening one for reading blocks until a writer
    appears, so the hardening itself hangs. Both flags are needed, and neither is what
    decides -- the screen below is.

    First choice is ``os.link``, which cannot clobber, and it is called with
    ``follow_symlinks=False`` so a swap landing after the verification links the link itself
    rather than its target. What LANDED is then checked by inode too, because that link is
    still addressed by name.

    Where hard links are unsupported there is no second no-clobber RENAME in the stdlib --
    ``renameat2``'s ``RENAME_NOREPLACE`` is Linux-only and unexposed -- and the two obvious
    substitutes are each a documented loss:

    * ``rename`` after checking the name is free puts a check-to-use window between the look
      and the act, so a file arriving in between is replaced. That is the same
      trusted-a-name mistake this module exists to remove.
    * giving up leaves the tree holding data with nothing that lists it: unreachable and
      unrecoverable.

    ``O_CREAT | O_EXCL`` is the third option and has neither flaw. The create either wins or
    fails with ``EEXIST``, decided inside one syscall, so nothing can arrive in a window;
    and it needs no hard-link support, so it strands nothing. The cost is a copy rather than
    a link, paid only on a filesystem without links and only when a removal already failed.

    Note WHY the copy path cannot be skipped by probing first: ``os.link in
    os.supports_dir_fd`` tests whether the OS accepts ``dir_fd``, not what the MOUNT
    supports, so a filesystem without hard links passes that probe and then refuses the
    call. A guard built on the probe is a guard that fails exactly where it matters.

    believes about this directory. It is called once with ``(root_fd, tree)`` before
    anything is removed, and returning a reason string refuses the whole removal having
    touched nothing. It is REQUIRED, and not nullable. Resolving the parent does NOT by
    itself prove the opened directory is the caller's, because ``Path.resolve()`` follows an
    ancestor that is ALREADY a link -- so a swap landing before the resolve produces a
    perfectly pinned walk to the wrong tree, and pinning alone would then delete it. What
    defeats that is the caller asking a question only its own directory can answer, and
    asking it of the descriptor rather than of the path. A removal that asks nothing is the
    weaker mode, and there is no caller that wants it: leaving the parameter optional would
    only make the weak mode available to a future caller by omission.

    *keep_until_empty* names a top-level FILE to remove LAST, and it exists because the
    order is load-bearing rather than tidy. Some trees are only DISCOVERABLE through one
    entry -- an index, a manifest -- and removing that first means a later failure leaves
    the rest of the tree on disk with nothing that lists it: data neither visible nor
    recoverable, while the removal reported a partial success. So the named entry is skipped
    by the file pass, the closing scan must find nothing but it, and only then is it moved
    aside and the tree removed. If the tree still will not go, the entry goes back through
    :func:`put_back_no_clobber`, which cannot overwrite whatever arrived at that name and
    needs no hard-link support to succeed.

    Raises *refusal* on a platform that cannot pin (see
    :func:`supports_pinned_tree_walk`) rather than falling back to a by-name removal. That
    is this module's standing rule: the caller is told and decides. It also raises
    *refusal* when the target cannot be opened at all, which is precisely the ancestor swap
    the pinned walk exists to catch.

    Returns rather than raises for a tree that would not go: ``removed`` is False and
    ``survivors`` says how much is left, so a caller can keep the directory visible instead
    of reporting a success that did not happen.

    *resolved_path* must already be RESOLVED -- see :func:`pin_parent` for why demanding
    that is safe rather than brittle.

    the closing scan turns into silent loss: the ``rmdir`` then fails on a non-empty
