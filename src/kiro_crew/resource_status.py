"""Lightweight, read-only host-resource probe.

Shared by two advisory surfaces:

* the **pressure-gated context line** injected in
  :meth:`kiro_crew.context.ContextManager.build_message` — a compact
  ``[RESOURCES]`` note the gateway adds to a turn ONLY when host memory is
  tight/critical, so the model can pick the lighter path for heavy work. It
  rides the gateway context rail (not an agent tool grant), so it survives
  agent switches, including custom agents.
* the **``resource_status`` pull tool** in ``mcp_core`` — an on-demand probe
  the model can call before a heavy step ("am I clear to run the full suite?").

The advisory surfaces carry no enforcement, no lease, no cross-session
coordination. Two sessions can both read "ample" and both launch heavy work —
the tradeoff of a cheap, zero-tuning guard. One narrow enforcement point sits
on top: :func:`admission_check` gates *background* work admission (scheduled
cron firings, task-runner steps) while posture is CRITICAL, so the scheduler
stops piling work onto a host that is about to freeze. Subagent spawns are not
gated here: they admit on their own memory floor (``agent.spawn_min_memory_gb``). Direct user chat turns
and the gateway's own operation are never gated, and the gate fails open on an
unknown posture. (A hard, cross-session admission lease is a separate, heavier
design.)

The memory figure reuses :func:`kiro_crew.subagent._available_memory_gb`, the
same cgroup-clamped, container-aware probe behind the sub-agent cap's
memory-readability check and the TaskRunner's memory-sized auto value, so the
two never disagree. It is imported lazily to keep this module import-cheap
and free of any import cycle (``context`` imports this; ``subagent`` is heavy).

Alongside memory the probe reads one more ceiling: the agent slice's TASK count
against its ``pids.max`` (see :func:`_read_agent_slice_tasks`). The slice's
memory headroom already reaches the posture through the cgroup-clamped memory
probe, while its task headroom reached nothing — a breach there fails ``fork()``
for every agent under that slice at once, yet the count that approaches it was
readable only from ``/sys/fs/cgroup`` by hand. It reaches the pull tool's report,
the injected line, and the diagnostics bundle. It is REPORTED, never gated: the
posture stays a single memory scalar, so :func:`admission_check` and
:func:`prewarm_allowance` behave exactly as before at any task count.

On macOS the probe also reads the kernel's memory-pressure level
(:func:`read_memory_pressure_level`). The level does not change the posture,
which stays figure-based, and gates nothing here: it is reported on the same
surfaces. The subagent gate's pressure hold reads it fresh through the same
reader (``docs/system-specs/modules/subagent.md``).

# Pre-warmed (eager spawn) session population, derived from host memory.
#
# Each speculative session is one full kiro-cli process plus its own MCP
# servers, held live and unclaimed until a real turn arrives or the idle
# sweep / prefetch TTL fires. The allowance is the per-host answer to "how
# many of those may sit idle": none when the host is already in the critical
# band, one in the tight band, and the historical fixed cap of three above
# it. The bands ARE the advisory posture: the allowance is keyed by the
# bucket ``_classify`` returns for the same reading and the same
# ``_resolve_thresholds(cfg)`` result the ``[RESOURCES]`` line uses, so a
# host tuned via ``agent.resource_pressure_gb`` / ``agent.resource_critical_gb``
# gets a matching allowance, and the pre-warm population shrinks in step with
# the posture rather than on a second, disagreeing scale. ``unknown`` (an
# unreadable probe) keeps the fixed cap: a host the probe cannot measure is
# never made worse by it.
#
# SESSION = PROCESS is a premise here, not an accident of wording. It holds
# today because every pre-warm spawns its own runtime. Where a session can join
# an existing runtime instead, a pre-warm claim costs a lease rather than a
# process, and this allowance then over-charges: it holds back pre-warms the
# host could afford, so the host is UNDER-used, never over-committed. That is
# the safe direction to be wrong in, which is why the number is left alone and
# the premise is written down instead. The fix when sharing lands is to size on
# the runtimes a pre-warm will actually SPAWN, not on the sessions it will serve.
#
# The macOS kernel memory-pressure hold is NOT applied here: it is the subagent
# gate's rule, and the eager-spawn ADMISSION reads it from the manager
# (``chat_runner._admit_prefetch``'s caller), never the re-probe after a
# pre-warm registered.
