"""Argv-structural floor for recursive-force ``rm`` deletion of root / home.

Split out of ``argv_floor.py`` as a cohesive sibling: this module owns the
recursive-force ``rm`` deny floor and nothing else. ``argv_floor.is_denied``'s
caller reaches it through :func:`_recursive_force_rm_targets` (and the
fail-closed fallback), which read only the ``rm`` command's OWN argv and return
the catastrophic target set ``{"root", "home"}`` a command deletes.

This floor is a UNION with the two ``rm`` catalog regexes, which stay LIVE in
the ``re`` deny tier as a fail-closed net: the regex catches a quoted payload
this floor's own-argv model cannot reach (``su -c "rm -rf /"``, ``eval``), while
this floor adds the structural flag/target-spelling coverage. The regex's one
false positive — a ``grep``-family search that merely names the literal — is
narrowed by the ``_DENY_EXCEPTIONS`` grep inert-search carve-out.

# ── Recursive-force ``rm`` deletion floor ──
# ``rm`` recursively force-deleting ROOT or HOME is catastrophic; a path UNDER
# either stays allowed. Catalog literals matched one flag spelling; a REGEX
# widening fails (can't see flags after the operand; fires on a SUBSTRING). The
# sound closure is argv-STRUCTURAL and EXACT: read the ``rm``'s OWN argv, deny only
# when a resolved operand IS root or home itself. UNION with the two catalog
# regexes (kept LIVE). Tokens RAW/ENV-UNEXPANDED, so home is by spelling (expanding
# reads ``$HOME`` as ROOT — GPT + Opus). PROGRAM ``rm`` only.


#: ``rm``'s long options, so an abbreviation can be tested for ambiguity. GNU
#: ``getopt_long`` accepts any UNAMBIGUOUS prefix, so ``rm --rec …`` / ``rm --for
#: …`` run the identical recursive/force delete a fixed string compare would miss
#: (GPT). A prefix is honoured only when it matches exactly ONE option — ``--r`` ->
