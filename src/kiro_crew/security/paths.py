"""Keystone: the sensitive-path lists, the resolver, the gates.

This is the always-on floor. Every other tier can be narrowed on the argument
that the OS sandbox sees the same thing; these declarations are the record of
what must stay unreadable and unwritable to the agent no matter which sandbox is
in force, and the gates below are what roughly forty modules import by name.

The comments on the declarations carry more weight than the code does: each one
records why an entry sits on the read-plus-write floor rather than the write-only
tier, which is not recoverable from the list itself. Read them before adding,
moving or removing an entry.

Layered internally. Layer one is declarations, predicates, the bounded resolver
and the public path gates, and it reads nothing else in this package. Layer two is
the command-line orchestrator, :func:`is_sensitive_bash_command`: it composes the
egress tier and the rules catalog, both of which load-import layer one, so it
reaches them through call-time imports in the one body that needs them. The fence
between the two layers is a comment and this module's load-time import list, not
a second file.

The command-line gate does not match paths. Sensitive paths are enforced by the OS
sandbox on the agent's process tree and by :func:`is_sensitive_path` on every
resolved path the file tools open; a regex over the text of a shell command added
no protection on top of those and denied ordinary read-only commands, so the
orchestrator carries only the size ceiling, the IMDS detector and the
environment-credential detector.

The resolver is bounded on purpose. A path check runs synchronously on the event
loop against an agent-supplied token, so a stalled automount under that token
would wedge the gateway. Resolution is therefore off-loaded to a small dedicated
pool with a deadline, and a stall fails CLOSED for every path under the stalled
prefix until the mount answers again.

# ── Publish artifacts of a keystone leaf ──
# Every leaf above is published through ``atomic_write``, which writes a
# ``tempfile.mkstemp(dir=path.parent, suffix=".tmp")`` sibling and renames it over the
# target; several stores also take a lock file beside the leaf they guard
# (``.policy.lock`` for the ops autonomy ceiling, ``ops_mission_control_secrets.json.lock``,
# ``.crons.lock``). Those siblings carry the SAME bytes as the leaf -- the temp holds the
# full payload for the whole write -- but a leaf entry matches its exact name only, so
# they sat outside the fence while the guarantee was stated as absolute.
#
# A DIRECTORY leaf never had this gap: its temps land INSIDE the fenced directory, where
# the ``startswith(target + os.sep)`` rule already covers them. That is exactly why
# ``webhooks``, ``routing``, ``.vault``, ``kas``, ``run``, ``cron-history`` and
# ``apps/aws-control/data`` are written as directories, and their comments say so. The gap
# is the leaves whose parent is NOT itself fenced -- in practice the crew data-home root,
# which cannot simply be fenced wholesale because reading ``config.json`` and
# ``sessions.db`` there is routine and intended (see ``_WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS``).
#
# So the fence is DERIVED FROM the leaf declarations rather than restated per leaf: an
# artifact-shaped name sitting in the parent directory of any keystone leaf is protected.
# A leaf added later inherits the protection with no second entry to remember, which is
# the only version of this that stays true -- the reason the gap existed at all is that
# the exception was invisible at every call site.
#
# Derived from ``_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``, deliberately NOT from ``_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS``:
# that list also carries ``.aws``, ``.ssh`` and the kiro-cli identity stores, whose parent
# is ``$HOME`` ITSELF, so deriving from it would fence ``~/*.tmp`` and ``~/*.lock`` across
# the user's entire home directory.
#
# Keyed on the artifact SHAPE, not on ``<leaf>.tmp``: the real mkstemp name is
# ``tmpXXXXXXXX.tmp`` and carries no leaf name at all, so a leaf-derived temp name would
# fence a spelling no writer produces. ``<leaf>.lock`` IS a real shape
# (``ops_mission_control_secrets.json.lock``), and the suffix rule covers both.

# ── Write-protected paths (block modification, allow reads) ──
# Runtime config files carry security-relevant resource ceilings (concurrent
# subagents, per-agent turn budget, warm-pool size). A prompt-injected agent
# with file-write access must not be able to rewrite these to inflate its own
# limits and drive host resource exhaustion (pentest — config-loader bound
# bypass, recommendation: block agent tools from modifying config files).
#
# They are DELIBERATELY NOT in ``_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS`` above: that list is the
# shared read+write gate, and reading config.json is routine and intended (the
# dashboard file viewer, ``cat``, and knowledge indexing all read it). We
# instead block only WRITES, at the agent file-edit tool gate
# (hooks.on_tool_call), via ``is_sensitive_write_path``. That gate sees the
# file-edit tool only, and the loader's clamp bounds NUMBERS, not SWITCHES
# (``agent.sandbox: "off"``), so the load-bearing half is the OS sandbox, which
# mounts both files read-only (``sandbox._CREW_READONLY_LEAVES``). The operator
# edits config out-of-band (dashboard API / own-terminal CLI), outside both.
# (The denied-command opt-out state does NOT live here — it is a security
# ceiling and lives on the read+write keystone floor in ``denied_commands.json``
# above, so no bash-level write matcher is needed for it. The computer-use primary
# enable is on that same floor, for the same reason.)
#
# SCOPE LIMIT worth stating where the matchers live: every path matcher in this
# module reasons about a PATH STRING. Computer use reaches state that has no path
# — a password field's ``AXValue``, a logged-in banking tab, an editor window
# already showing ``~/.aws/credentials`` as pixels and as accessibility text. No
# addition to either list here can see any of it. That is why
# ``computer_use/policy.py``'s bundle-id denylist (terminals, password managers,
# keychains) and its secure-subrole refusal are load-bearing security controls in
# their own right rather than conveniences, and why the always-on secure-field

# ── Bounded symlink resolution for the sensitive-path gates ──
#
# ``os.path.realpath`` / ``Path.resolve`` ``lstat`` every component of the path
# they are handed.  The path gates hand them AGENT-SUPPLIED tokens -- including
# tokens that name nothing on this host at all, like the remote side of
# ``ssh host 'cd /home/user/ws && ...'`` -- and a component that lands on a
# stalled automount (macOS ``/home`` is an autofs map resolved through
# opendirectoryd; a dead NFS/SSHFS mount; a disconnected mapped drive) blocks in
# the kernel for as long as the mount does.  No exception is raised, so the
# ``except OSError`` around the call never fired: the call simply never
# returned.  Because :func:`is_sensitive_path` runs synchronously inside
# ``on_tool_call`` on the event loop, that was a loop
# wedge and the stall watchdog's dump-then-exit -- ten identical crash dumps on
# a corp macOS during a VPN transition, the loop parked in ``_joinrealpath`` for
# the full watchdog budget.  Widening the budget only moved the crash.
#
# So resolution runs on its own tiny pool and the caller waits a BOUNDED time.
# A timeout is NOT treated like the ``OSError`` fallback (lexical forms only):
# that would make the degraded state a lever -- stall one token under a wedged
# mount and, for the cooldown, a workspace symlink into a credential store
# would pass on its lexical spelling.  A path whose canonical form cannot be
# established is instead REFUSED (:class:`PathResolutionStalled`, fail-closed
# in every gate), the same posture the rest of this module takes when a proof
# is missing.  The cost is a false refusal of paths under a wedged mount for
# the cooldown window -- the ``ssh`` command above is refused for 30s during a
# VPN transition instead of killing the gateway -- and the refusal names why.
#
# A timeout also opens a short cooldown during which paths under the SAME
# prefix are refused without touching the filesystem: one tool call can
# carry many path tokens against the same wedged mount, each of which would
# otherwise pay the full timeout -- ten tokens at 2s would put the loop back
# past the watchdog.  The cooldown is scoped to the stalled prefix
# (:func:`_stall_prefix`), never process-wide, so a stall on ``/home/<user>``
# leaves ``/tmp`` and the workspace fully resolved.  It doubles on every
# repeat stall under the same prefix (up to the cap below).
#
# The ``realpath`` itself runs in a CHILD INTERPRETER (``kiro_crew.subprocess_pool``,
# ``executors.path_resolve_executor``), reached from the calling thread with
# ``call_op``: ``realpath`` is pure Python and reacquires the GIL twice per path
# component, so on a thread it paid one switch interval per component beside every
# other busy thread in the gateway and expired a budget the disk never touched.
# A child pays one handoff for the whole answer, and a child that misses
# the deadline is KILLED and respawned, so a stall costs one refused resolution
# rather than a pinned worker.

# calls, a warm one 4. Sizing this to the work actually done is what stops an
# ordinarily-slow rebuild from being mistaken for a wedged mount on a loaded host
# (4 xdist workers plus real-time antivirus on a 4-vCPU Windows runner is where it

# jitter stays free, and 20x under the 2.0s default candidate budget, so it stays
# far below both a single missed-budget timeout and the slow-but-completing case

# syscall table. Paid at most once per prefix per cooldown, because the charge that
# follows a grace miss refuses later paths under the prefix without probing.
#
# The grace is FOLDED INTO the child's one deadline (budget plus grace) rather than

    A wedged mount stalls everything beneath its mount point, and mount points
    sit at depth one or two (``/home/<user>`` autofs, ``/Volumes/<share>``,
    ``/net/<host>``, ``C:\\Users\\<user>``), so two components is the narrowest key
    that still covers the whole stalled subtree.  Scoping the cooldown here is
    what keeps a stall on the REMOTE half of an ``ssh`` command from switching
    resolution off for the local workspace where a bypass symlink would live.

    **The DRIVE is split off first, and on Windows that is what makes the key two
    components rather than one.**  A POSIX absolute path starts with an empty
    component (``"/a/b"`` -> ``["", "a", "b"]``), which is why three are kept; a
    Windows path does not (``"C:\\Users\\bob"`` -> ``["C:", "Users", "bob"]``), so
    counting components without splitting the drive kept ``C:`` as one of the two
    and collapsed every user path to ``C:\\Users``.  That single key contains
    ``$HOME``, ``%TEMP%``, the workspace and the checkout, so one stall anywhere in
    the profile refused path resolution for essentially the whole host -- the exact
    opposite of the per-mount isolation this function exists to provide.

    **The key never ENDS on a container of homes**, a component spelled ``home``.
    A host whose homes sit one level deeper than ``/home`` reproduces the
    ``C:\\Users`` collapse on POSIX: two components of ``/local/home/<user>/ws/f``
    is ``/local/home``, which holds every user, every workspace and checkout, the
    data home and the credential stores, so one stall anywhere under it refused
    path resolution for the whole host (kirodotdev/KiroCrew#12386).  When the
    second component is such a container the key takes one more, so the boundary
    is the home directory itself -- ``/local/home/<user>`` -- exactly the key a
    ``/home/<user>`` layout already gets.  Every other key is unchanged, and the
    container alone (``/local/home``) stays its own key.

    The rule is lexical, like the rest of this function: it must not touch the
    filesystem, because it is consulted BEFORE deciding whether to probe at all
    and it names the prefix charged when the ``$HOME`` anchor itself stalls.  A
    mount-derived key (``os.path.ismount`` walked upward) would both ``lstat``
    the very mount that may be wedged and, on a single-filesystem host, reach
    ``/`` -- a process-wide key, worse than the collapse.  The price of a lexical
    key stands: two spellings of one tree (``/home/<user>`` and its
    ``/local/home/<user>`` target) remain two keys, each paying its own timeout.
    And when the container is itself ONE wedged mount (an NFS ``/export/home``),
    each user's tree pays its own timeout and pins its own worker -- the cost a
    ``/home/<user>`` autofs layout already carries per user, bounded the same
    way, by the pool size -- in exchange for the isolation this key exists for.

    A UNC share root is returned whole: ``\\\\server\\share`` IS the mount point,
    and ``splitdrive`` already reports it as the drive, so no component of the
    remainder belongs in the key.

def _child_blocked_in_filesystem(sampled: bytes | None) -> bool:
    """True when the child's syscall at the deadline was one a path resolution blocks in.

    *sampled* is what the executor read from ``/proc/<pid>/syscall`` the instant the
    budget ran out, before it killed the child (:class:`SubprocessPoolTimeout`).  It
    separates the two causes of a started-but-unfinished resolution, which the budget
    alone cannot: a child stuck on a wedged mount versus one that was starved of the
    CPU.  Both consume almost no CPU, so a CPU-time comparison cannot tell them apart,
    and neither can the ``/proc`` state field: measured on a 48-core host, a thread
    doing ordinary ``lstat`` work and a thread doing nothing but burn CPU BOTH
    alternate between ``R`` and ``S`` from one sample to the next.

    What does separate them is WHICH syscall the process is in.  One genuinely blocked
    in a kernel wait reports that syscall on every sample; one merely contending
    reports ``running`` or a ``futex``.  And these syscalls complete in microseconds
    on a healthy filesystem, so sampling one at all is itself evidence that it is not
    completing.  The child has no GIL to wait on -- it is alone in its interpreter --
    so the starved case is now the rarer one, but it is still the one that must not
    open a prefix-wide cooldown.

    UNVERIFIED, and deliberately not claimed: that a process stuck in one of these
    syscalls on a real wedged NFS, FUSE or CIFS mount reports it stably.  No wedged
    mount could be produced where this was measured (an unprivileged ``fusermount3``
    and ``unshare(CLONE_NEWUSER)`` both return EPERM).  What IS confirmed is the
    sampling this rests on, including for the state class a wedged FUSE or CIFS mount
    actually waits in: an ``openat`` on a FIFO with no writer blocks INTERRUPTIBLY on a
    real filesystem path and reported state ``S`` with syscall 257 on 15 of 15
    samples.  See ``test_an_in_s_filesystem_wait_is_sampled_stably_and_reads_as_blocked``.

    The table covers ``readlink`` as well as the stat family because CPython's
    ``posixpath.realpath`` calls ``os.lstat`` AND ``os.readlink`` per component: a
    mount that answers the lstat from cache and hangs the readlink would otherwise
    read as not blocked, take the load arm, and pay an uncharged full-budget probe per
    token rather than opening one cooldown.

    Fails toward the EXISTING behaviour -- no sample (non-Linux, or the child was
    already gone), or an architecture whose syscall numbers are not mapped -- by
    returning True, so the caller still charges the prefix rather than silently
    withholding an escalation the gate would otherwise make.

    Both kinds of resolution stat the same filesystem from the event loop, so they
    share one child pool, one budget and one per-prefix cooldown: a stall observed

    the same window, and a stall on a candidate keeps the anchors from re-probing
    the same wedged mount every time the target cache expires.

    Returns the worker's value, or ``None`` when resolution FAILED -- the pool
    refused work at interpreter exit, or faulted in a way the worker did not
    classify.  A resolution that does not COMPLETE is different and raises
    :class:`PathResolutionStalled` instead, both on the timing-out call and,
    without touching the filesystem, for every later call under the same
    :func:`_stall_prefix` until the cooldown lapses.  Repeated stalls under one
    prefix double the cooldown up to ``_PATH_RESOLVE_COOLDOWN_MAX_SECS``.  Never
    blocks the caller for longer than *budget* plus its grace -- a capped fraction
    of *budget* folded into the child's single deadline, since a child that misses
    it is destroyed rather than waited on.  The wait also consumes the calling
    thread's cumulative allowance -- excluding a wait below the floor, round-trip
    overhead rather than filesystem latency; exhaustion refuses without a request
    or a charge until the quiet window expires.

    WHAT A TIMEOUT MEANS, and how the prefix is charged.  The thread pool this
    replaced classified a miss by thread-shaped signals -- was the future ever
    claimed, was the worker started, what syscall was that thread in -- and none of
    those has a referent once the work is a process reached from this thread.  The
    child-shaped signals are the exception the pool raises:

    * a plain ``TimeoutError`` means NO child ever took the request (every child was
      leased to another caller for the whole budget): evidence about load, not the
      mount, so this call alone is refused and nothing is charged;
    * :class:`SubprocessPoolTimeout` means a child took it and missed the deadline,
      and carries what that child was doing when the budget ran out.  Blocked in a
      stat/readlink syscall, or unsampleable (non-Linux, unmapped architecture), and
      the mount is charged; on-CPU or in a ``futex``, and it is the load arm:
      refused, not charged, bounded by :func:`_load_arm_budget_spent`.  Charging
      ALSO requires that the budget and grace were granted in full: a wait clamped by
      the allowance proves nothing about the mount.

    The UNC shortcut is NOT here: skipping a ``\\\\server\\share`` token is a
    stance about agent-supplied CANDIDATES (:func:`_resolved_forms_bounded`),
    whose fence targets a UNC realpath never produces.  The anchors are the
    fence itself, and a UNC home with a junction inside ``KIROCREW_HOME`` must
    still be canonicalised or a canonical-spelling request would miss the
    governance file (found in review); the bound makes that probe safe.

    *budget* sizes the wait to the work the caller submits: the anchor REBUILD is
    one request carrying ~130 paths and passes
    ``_PATH_RESOLVE_REBUILD_TIMEOUT_SECS``, while a candidate resolution keeps the
    default.

class _BuiltTargets(set[str]):
    """The target set, plus whether building it traversed a symlink.

    A plain ``set`` wherever it is consumed -- membership, iteration, equality
    and the casefold contract are all unchanged -- carrying one extra fact that
    only the CACHE needs and no matcher does: did any path this build actually
    RESOLVED come back spelled differently from the path it was asked about.

    WHICH paths those are is the entire scope of the flag, so they are named here
    rather than left to be read as "every target". The build resolves five classes
    of path and no others: ``$HOME``, ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME``, each entry of the
    CALLER'S ``home_dirs`` list that carries a crew prefix, re-anchored under
    ``KIROCREW_HOME``, each kiro-cli path in ``_KIRO_CLI_WRITE_TIER_LEAVES`` -- the
    agents dir and the MCP registry leaf, resolved under ``$HOME`` AND re-anchored
    under ``KIRO_HOME``, one class because they share one rule -- and each harness
    credential leaf re-anchored under its own home override. Every
    other member of the set comes from ``_anchor`` or
    ``_anchor_both_separators``, neither of which touches the filesystem, so the
    bulk of the set cannot report a traversal at all.

    An ordinary symlinked dotfile under ``$HOME`` can set this flag, and a
    dotfile-managed home is therefore a case to look for. The trigger is the union
    this build already resolves: a crew-prefixed entry of the caller's
    ``home_dirs`` under ``KIROCREW_HOME``, a kiro-cli path under ``$HOME`` or under
    ``KIRO_HOME``, or a DECLARED credential leaf under whichever harness variable
    relocates it. The kiro-cli arm is why a dotfile-managed ``~/.kiro`` reports a
    traversal on the write tier: that is the case it exists to cover. So a
    symlinked ``sessions`` or ``models`` leaf under a ``KIROCREW_HOME`` that sits
    below ``$HOME`` pins the write tier, and a symlinked ``goose`` directory under
    whatever ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` resolves to pins the tier handed that leaf. Read
    that second one literally: the leaf resolved is
    ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/goose/secrets.yaml``, so it is the exported root that has to
    contain the symlink. A host whose ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` points somewhere other
    than ``~/.config`` can symlink ``~/.config/goose`` all it likes and no build
    will resolve it. What CANNOT set it is a dotfile in none of those classes,
    because the bulk targets are never resolved. The roots themselves cannot
    either: ``_resolve_root_anchors`` canonicalises every root first, so the
    symlink has to sit BELOW the resolved root -- which is why relocating the
    exported config root alone does not trip it while a symlinked ``goose``
    directory under it does.

    The LEAF-BEARING override roots are ``KIROCREW_HOME``, ``KIRO_HOME``, and every
    variable in ``host_auth.home_override_env_vars()``. That table is the
    enumeration; naming the variables or their count here would be a second place
    to forget the next harness, which is the documentation defect this docstring
    exists to remove. ``_OVERRIDE_ROOT_ENVS`` carries one more root,
    ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME``, which is resolved as a root but bears no leaf class of
    its own -- its entries are joined lexically by ``_anchor_both_separators``.

    The crew-prefix class is the caller's list, not a fixed set of leaves. The
    crew-prefix arm loops over the ``home_dirs`` it was handed and resolves every
    entry carrying a prefix, and the three callers hand it three different lists:
    the read gate passes ``_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS``, ``is_sensitive_write_path``
    passes ``_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS + _WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS``, and
    ``_is_keystone_publish_artifact`` passes ``_KEYSTONE_ARTIFACT_PARENTS``. So no
    one class of leaf describes the resolved population: on the write tier a
    symlinked write-protected crew leaf that holds no secret sets the flag too,
    and the three builds can disagree about it on one host.

    That fact is what bounds the deeper-leaf staleness the target cache always
    carried. A resolved path that comes back different came through a symlink at
    or below a resolved root, and THAT is the entry a repoint can move out from
    under a cached set. When nothing resolved differently there is no
    resolution-derived entry to go stale, so the long adaptive expiry is safe;
    when one did, the expiry is pinned to the floor. See
    :func:`_home_targets_ttl`.

    The roots cannot trip it. Every root reaching the builder is already
    canonical (:func:`_resolve_root_anchors` resolved them), so re-resolving one
    returns the same string -- which matters on a host where ``$HOME`` is itself
    a symlink, because flagging that would pin the floor on every cloud desktop
    and the adaptive expiry would never apply anywhere.

    Carried as an ATTRIBUTE rather than a second return value because
    ``_home_dir_targets_uncached`` has several callers and three test doubles. A
    widened signature would break each of them, whereas a double that returns a
    plain ``set`` simply lacks the attribute and reads as the class default
    below -- ``True``, the fail-safe answer, which selects the floor.

    module level.  It touches the filesystem, so in production this function
    runs under the bounded core via :func:`_home_dir_targets` (see there
    for why); only direct callers and tests run it inline.

    Two passes over the same anchoring logic (:func:`_anchor_targets`) so the
    ~130 per-leaf ``realpath`` calls travel as ONE child round trip instead of one
    each: the first pass runs with no answers and only records which paths it asks
    for (every anchor derives from *roots* and *home_dirs*, never from an earlier
    answer, so the set is complete), then the batch is resolved and the second pass
    builds the real set from it.

    *roots* optionally supplies the already-resolved :class:`_ResolvedRoots`
    already resolved by the caller. The TTL cache in :func:`_home_dir_targets` MUST pass
    it: resolving the roots here as well would read the filesystem a second
    time, and a root symlink repointed between the two reads would file this
    set under a key naming the OTHER root — caching one root's targets against
    another root's key, which fails OPEN. ``None`` (direct callers and tests)
    resolves them here as before.

    Anchors against BOTH the logical home and its realpath.  On macOS the
    per-user temp/home prefix can itself be reached via OS symlinks (``/var`` →
    ``/private/var``); folding both roots in means a resolved candidate under
    either spelling is still matched.

    ``home_dirs`` entries are authored with POSIX "/" separators, and some are
    multi-segment now (e.g. ".kiro/crew/security_policy.json"). Split on "/"
    and re-join with ``os.path.join`` so the target uses the running OS's
    separator — otherwise on Windows the target keeps a literal "/" in the
    leaf while the candidate forms (realpath/normpath) are all-backslash, they
    never compare equal, and the keystone would silently stop gating its own
    secrets. On POSIX a single-segment entry splits to a 1-element list, so
    this is a no-op there.

# How long a built target set stays reusable. ``_home_dir_targets_uncached``
# rebuilds a ~75-entry set on EVERY ``is_sensitive_path`` call and measured at
# 1.14ms of that call's 1.25ms (91%) on a dev desktop, because it realpath()s
# ``$HOME`` and each KIROCREW_HOME-anchored leaf. Callers hit it per FILE — one
# skills-tree walk made thousands of identical calls and took 4.2s, of which
# 3.5s was this rebuild.
#
# Deliberately TTL-bounded rather than a plain ``lru_cache``: part of the set is
# derived from FILESYSTEM state, so an unbounded cache would keep matching a
# stale target if a symlink were repointed after the cache warmed — a gate that
# fails OPEN. ``_HOME_TARGETS_TTL_MAX_SECS`` bounds that window.
#
# The key is built from the RESOLVED roots (``Path.home().resolve()`` and the
# resolved ``KIROCREW_HOME``), NOT from the raw env vars, because those two
# values are exactly what the builder anchors its targets on. Keying on the raw
# ``$HOME`` string is wrong twice over:
#   1. Repointing a symlink AT ``$HOME`` leaves ``$HOME`` unchanged while every
#      target moves, so the gate returns False for a credential path the
#      uncached code blocks (a real, reproduced bypass — see the regression
#      test ``test_repointed_home_symlink_is_not_served_from_cache``).
#   2. ``Path.home()`` reads ``USERPROFILE`` on Windows and never ``HOME``, so on
#      that platform the key omits the one variable that decides the anchor.
# Resolving the roots costs ~2 realpath calls (~0.06ms) against the ~1.14ms
# rebuild it replaces, so the win survives. Those calls -- and the rebuild
# itself -- run on the ``mc-pathres`` pool under the resolve budget, one thread
# hop each (``_resolved_root_key`` resolves all six roots in one job,
# ``_rebuild_targets_bounded`` resolves every leaf in one job), because
# an inline ``realpath($HOME)`` on a loaded Windows desktop blocked past the
# loop-stall watchdog; see ``_rebuild_targets_bounded``.
#
# Residual, accepted: a symlink swapped DEEPER inside the crew home (an
# individual keystone leaf, or an intermediate directory on the way to one) can
# still be served stale for up to the TTL. Detecting that needs the per-leaf
# realpath calls that ARE the expense — measured 45 realpath calls per build,
# 94% of its 1.39ms — so there is no cheap way to keep the cache and revalidate
# them.
#
# The TTL is therefore sized as small as it can be while still doing its job.
# The FLOOR is 0.1s, NOT a "few seconds", because a skills walk issues thousands
# of calls in a burst and one build serves the whole burst either way. Measured
# cold-walk cost against a FIXED constant, on an idle interpreter:
#     5.0s -> 0.95s    1.0s -> 0.93s    0.1s -> 0.95s    0.0s -> 4.66s
# So 0.1s keeps the entire win while cutting the stale window 50x versus 5.0s.
# Only 0.0 (no cache) closes the window completely, and that reverts to the 4.7s
# scan whose GIL-held cost wedges the event loop -- the defect this exists to fix.
_HOME_TARGETS_TTL_SECS = 0.1

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Why the expiry is not that floor alone.
#
# 0.1s was chosen against an IDLE interpreter, where one rebuild costs ~2ms, so
# the cache spends ~2% of the wall clock rebuilding. But the rebuild is ~130
# ``os.path.realpath`` calls and each syscall releases and re-acquires the GIL,
# so its cost is set by CONTENTION, not by the disk. Measured on this repo's own
# anchors -- 64-core Linux, local xfs, one mount, ``sys.getswitchinterval()``
# 5ms -- with N sibling threads running pure Python:
#     0 -> 2ms    1 -> 581ms    2 -> 399ms    4 -> 3859ms    8 -> 7456ms
# A fixed 0.1s expiry does not move with that, so the share of the wall clock
# spent rebuilding rises with load until the rebuild misses
# ``_PATH_RESOLVE_REBUILD_TIMEOUT_SECS`` and the gate refuses ordinary project
# files. That is the reported defect, and the filesystem is healthy throughout.
#
# So the expiry tracks the MEASURED cost of the build it is expiring:
#
#     ttl = clamp(last rebuild seconds * _HOME_TARGETS_TTL_COST_RATIO,
#                 _HOME_TARGETS_TTL_SECS, _HOME_TARGETS_TTL_MAX_SECS)
#
# The ratio is the reciprocal of the share of the wall clock the gate may spend
# rebuilding, so that share is held at ``1 / ratio`` at EVERY load level rather
# than only at the one the constant was picked on. The rebuild's own duration is
# the load signal, so no separate load metric is read and nothing has to be
# configured per host.
#
# WHAT THIS DOES NOT FIX, stated rather than implied: an expiry controls how
# OFTEN the rebuild is paid, never what ONE costs. Past roughly four contending
# threads a single COLD rebuild already exceeds its own budget, and there every
# expiry refuses alike -- measured, see ``scripts/measure_path_gate_ttl.py``.
# Only a resolver outside this interpreter's GIL closes that case. This law's
# job is narrower: it stops re-paying the contended cost every 100ms.
#
# THE TRADE, stated plainly: a longer expiry lengthens the window in which a
# symlink swapped DEEPER inside the crew home (a keystone leaf, or an
# intermediate directory on the way to one) is still answered from the stale
# set -- the residual named above, now bounded by ``_HOME_TARGETS_TTL_MAX_SECS``
# rather than by 0.1s. It does NOT widen the two reproduced bypasses, because
# both repoint an ANCHOR and every anchor is part of the cache KEY: a repointed
# ``$HOME`` or ``KIROCREW_HOME`` re-keys and misses the cache at any expiry,
# which ``test_repointed_home_symlink_is_not_served_from_cache_at_the_longest_expiry``
# pins at the maximum expiry as well as at the floor.
#
# Both inputs are NAMED constants, each pinned by a test, and each an OPERATOR
# KNOB read once at import and fail-soft to its reviewed default:
# ``KIROCREW_PATH_GATE_TTL_COST_RATIO`` and ``KIROCREW_PATH_GATE_TTL_MAX_SECS``.
# So a host can trade the two the other way, or revert to one fixed 0.1s expiry
# with a ratio of 0, without a release and without patching this file.

    under ``$HOME`` or ``KIRO_HOME``, or a declared harness credential leaf under any
    variable in
    ``host_auth.home_override_env_vars()`` --
    the build that was handed that leaf reports a traversal, ITS expiry is
    therefore the floor, and both knobs read as no-ops for that tier to whoever
    tunes them. The refusals then come back with nothing in the log to say why the
    fix did not apply to this host.

    A dotfile-managed home IS a case to look for. The trigger is narrower than
    "any symlinked dotfile" but not exotic: the symlinked path has to fall in one
    of the three classes above -- a crew-prefixed entry of the caller's
    ``home_dirs`` under ``KIROCREW_HOME``, a kiro-cli path under ``$HOME`` or
    ``KIRO_HOME``, or a declared harness credential leaf -- and it has to sit BELOW the resolved
    root, since ``_resolve_root_anchors`` canonicalises each root first. A
    symlinked ``sessions`` leaf under a ``KIROCREW_HOME`` below ``$HOME`` is that
    shape, and so is a ``goose`` directory symlinked into a store underneath
    whatever ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` resolves to -- the leaf resolved is
    ``$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/goose/secrets.yaml``, so the symlink has to be under the
    exported root and not under ``~/.config`` unless that is the same directory. A
    dotfile in none of those classes cannot report
    a traversal, because the bulk targets are never resolved.

    The dedup is per ``home_dirs`` list, because that list is what decides the
    answer. The gates hand the builder three different ones -- the read gate passes
    ``_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS``, :func:`is_sensitive_write_path` passes that plus
    ``_WRITE_PROTECTED_HOME_PATHS``, and :func:`_is_keystone_publish_artifact`
    passes ``_KEYSTONE_ARTIFACT_PARENTS`` -- while a symlinked write-protected crew
    leaf that holds no secret (``models``, ``sessions``, ``app-sources``) sits in
    the write gate's list alone. So one host can have the write build resolve that
    leaf and pin the floor while the keystone-artifact build reports no traversal
    and selects the cost-tracking expiry. Under one shared slot each of those builds
    flips the key the other just set, so the line alternates between two opposite
    messages for as long as the disagreement lasts and neither survives long enough
    to read as a state. A per-list slot lets each build transition its OWN state: a
    steady host says it once per tier rather than once per rebuild, and a tier that
    flips says it again.

    Both messages name the tier for the same reason. A reader diagnosing a refusal
    needs to know WHICH gate is pinned, and on a host whose builds disagree a line
    naming none of them cannot answer that -- the "cost-tracking expiry in force"
    half would read as the state of the whole gate while another tier is pinned to
    the floor, which is the opposite of the truth for whoever is tuning the knobs.

    Mirrors how :func:`_home_dir_targets_uncached` derives its anchors, so the
    cache key changes exactly when the anchors would. Falls back to the
    unresolved form on OSError/ValueError the same way the builder does.

    ``kiro_home`` is the resolved ``KIRO_HOME`` override (kiro-cli's own home
    override, honoured by ``kiro_agents_dir()``), or ``None`` when unset — it
    re-anchors the ``~/.kiro/agents`` write-protection, so a changed ``KIRO_HOME``
    must invalidate the cache. No validity check here (an unsafe value falls back
    to ``~/.kiro`` in ``kiro_home()``, already covered by the default form); it is
    resolved only so a symlinked override keys and anchors identically.

    ``adapter_roots`` does the same for every declared harness credential home in
    ``_OVERRIDE_ANCHORED_LEAVES``.

    ``logical_home`` is ``Path.home()`` UNRESOLVED.  It is a separate anchor, not
    a duplicate: on a host where ``$HOME`` is itself a symlink (``/home/x`` ->
    ``/local/home/x`` on cloud desktops) the resolved home spells every target
    one way while an agent-supplied ``~/.ssh/id_rsa`` spells it the other.  The
    resolved CANDIDATE normally bridges that -- but candidate resolution is
    bounded (:func:`_resolved_forms_bounded`) and degrades to the lexical
    spelling, which must still hit a target or the gate fails OPEN on exactly
    the hosts where ``$HOME`` is a link.  Keyed here so an env change that
    moves the logical spelling invalidates the cache like any other anchor.

    ``os_home`` is the resolved ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME`` override, or ``None`` when
    unset. It is an ALTERNATE ``$HOME``: ``pod.runtime.build_pod_env`` sets it
    and ``acp.client._apply_pod_home_remap`` makes it the literal ``HOME`` of a
    pod-spawned kiro-cli child, so kiro-cli's own ``$HOME``-derived credential
    store — the runtime identity store ``pod.runtime._seed_pod_os_home`` mirrors
    in, and the MCP OAuth grants that pod's own child MINTS under
    ``.aws/sso/cache`` — lives under this root rather than under the real home.
    No host SSO cache contents are copied in; that staging was removed. Anchoring
    it here is what fences the relocated tree, and it is the ONLY layer that can:
    the pod child's mount namespace must keep that tree readable AND writable
    because kiro-cli writes its grants there and no env lever relocates them. So
    the two audiences are split — the harness process reaches the tree, while an
    agent TOOL call naming any path under it is refused in-band here. Every
    ``home_dirs`` entry is re-anchored under it, not merely ``.aws``, because
    the variable relocates the whole home: the crew-home leaves, ``.ssh`` and
    every other fenced entry move with it. Same reasoning as the
    ``KIROCREW_HOME`` expansion below — an override must not move a secret out
    from under its own gate.

    25s loop-stall watchdog from inside ``on_tool_call``, and the gateway exits
    with every in-flight turn -- the same crash the bounded candidate
    resolution already prevents for the OTHER half of the check.

    The whole rebuild is ONE pool job, not one per leaf: a single bash command

    ``../../.aws/credentials`` traversal) must NOT be readable through the link.

    ANY of them lands in a matched location:

      1. the fully symlink-RESOLVED canonical target (``realpath`` /
         ``Path.resolve`` — follows every symlink in the chain, including
         intermediate directories and the final component).  This is what
         defeats the symlink bypass: the resolved target of the link is
         ``~/.aws/credentials`` even though the link's own name is benign.
      2. the LEXICALLY-normalized path (no symlink following) and the raw
         expanded string — so a path that *textually* names a matched dir is
         still caught when resolution fails (dangling link, permission error).

    ``base_dir`` anchors a *relative* input against the caller's known working
    directory (e.g. the agent's workspace cwd) so a relative title like
    ``sub/cfg.ini`` resolves against the real directory rather than whatever CWD
    the gateway process happens to have.  Absolute inputs are unaffected;
    ``base_dir=None`` preserves the historical CWD-relative behavior.
    ``pre_resolved`` is :func:`_candidate_forms`'s flag of the same name, and
    such a caller is by contract on its own worker thread, so the anchors are

    source file. A caller with a source body in hand must not route it here: every

    runtime control for what a script may open.

    the spelling of a command cannot talk around them: the OS sandbox hides the
    credential stores (``~/.aws``, ``~/.gnupg``, SSH keys) from the agent's process
