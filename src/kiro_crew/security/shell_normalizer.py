"""Shell text reader: tokenizer, quote and escape state machine, argv attribution.

Every tier that judges a command line reads it through this module. Nothing here
decides anything: it reconstructs what a shell would see -- splitting a line into
statements and words, tracking quote and escape state, peeling redirections and
substitutions off a word, attributing a token to the program that receives it,
decoding the escape forms a printer would emit, and reading the expansion shapes
whose value is unknowable without running the line.

That division is deliberate and load-bearing. A reader that under-approximates
blinds every tier at once, and no OS sandbox sees shell text, so this layer
over-approximates on purpose and the tiers above it are where precision belongs.
Narrowing a matcher means narrowing the site that DECIDES, never this one.

Imports only ``vocabulary``, the layer below, for the product's own name: the
tiers depend on the reader, never the reverse.

# ``*`` is a GLOB that expands to filenames, so the first becomes the script -- measured:
# ``python *> out`` runs the globbed file, and it still does with a here-string present.
# Reading ``*>`` as a redirect therefore over-triggers under bash, which costs a denial

    One walk over a token run, yielding whatever each stdin redirection puts on this
    interpreter's stdin.  The redirection families, from the shell grammar:

    * ``<<TAG`` / ``<<-TAG`` -- a heredoc; the BODY up to the matching tag is the program.
      An unterminated one runs to the end of the run, which over-yields, not under.
    * ``<<<WORD`` -- a here-string; the WORD itself is the program.
    * ``<WORD`` -- a file whose CONTENT is the program.
    * ``< <(cmd)`` -- process substitution; the command text is visible and spans tokens
      up to its closing paren, so it is yielded as a run.
    * ``<&N`` -- an fd dup, which carries no text at all; a documented residual.

    Walked as a RUN rather than "everything after the interpreter" because a
    redirection may appear ANYWHERE in a simple command -- BEFORE the program name
    (``<<'PY' python -``), after it, and GLUED TO IT with no space
    (``python3<<<'…'``, ``python3<prog.py``), all of which are ordinary bash reaching
    the same mint.  A token that carries a redirect
    after some other text is therefore classified from its first ``<`` onward: the
    text before it is the program name or an earlier operand, and the shell reads the
    rest as the redirection.

    The left-hand run is not split on a newline, so an earlier command's own stdin
    redirect is yielded too -- the same deliberate over-block the pipe producer has,
    and for the same reason.

    A heredoc's body ends at the LAST token equal to its tag, not the first.  Bash
    closes a heredoc only on a line that holds the delimiter ALONE, and line structure
    does not survive tokenizing -- so a body line that merely CONTAINS the word
    (``# EOF``, an ordinary Python comment) produced a token equal to the tag and closed
    the body early, leaving the real payload after it unscanned.
    The last occurrence is the delimiter that actually ends it; taking it
    over-yields only when the tag word recurs in a LATER command, which is the safe
    direction.

    * a stdin REDIRECTION -- heredoc body, here-string word, redirected file or process
      substitution -- anywhere in the command: before the program name, after it, or
      glued to it (:func:`_stdin_redirect_carriers`).  Walked over the WHOLE frame in ONE
      pass, not per side of the interpreter: a marker and its body can straddle the
      program name (``<<EOF python - … EOF``), and splitting the walk lost that
      association entirely.  Only REDIRECT OPERANDS are
      yielded, so a neighbouring command's ordinary argument is still never program text;
    * a PIPE PRODUCER -- the tokens left of this interpreter, when a pipe feeds it.
      The pipe is NOT reliably its own token: the tokenizer splits on whitespace only,
      so ``echo '…'|python -`` glues the operator into a neighbouring word and
      ``_program_basename`` resolves the program from the LAST control-operator
      segment.  So the pipe is detected as a CHARACTER anywhere left of, or glued
      into, the interpreter token, and that token's own leading segment is producer
      text.  Requiring a standalone ``|`` token would miss all four no-space spellings
      and let the producer's payload through.

    Both families over-yield on the left: any pipe, or any earlier command's own stdin
    redirect, qualifies.  That is the safe direction -- a missed carrier is a bypass,
    an extra token is only a visible refusal (pinned by a test).

    Everything else in the frame is another command's argv.  Scanning THAT is the
    defect: a frame is not split on a newline, so an unrelated neighbour that
    merely names this package in a FILE PATH (``isort src/kiro_crew/mcp_core.py``
    followed by any ``python - <<'PY' … PY``) makes a harmless heredoc read as a
    credential mint -- with no ``token`` word anywhere in the command.

    Yields lazily so the caller's ``any()`` short-circuits: the cost stays O(frame)

      a token is attributed to the PRECEDING command while the part after the
      operator is a new command that really runs.  An operator at the very END of
      the token (``cp $dir/*;``) starts no program inside the token: the word before

      consumer, a quoted ``'pkill;'`` or ``'kirocrew;'`` at PROGRAM position -- a
      symlink literally named with the operator -- never reaches it.)
    * the command pipes into a shell or evaluator (``echo … | sh``), where the
      printed text is executed rather than displayed.
    * the token OPENS with a command substitution (``ls $(kirocrew update)``,
      ``cat `kirocrew token```, quotes before it notwithstanding): the token's own
      basename reading IS the body's program, so excusing the token as data would
      excuse the program that runs.  A substitution LATER in the word
      (``cp report_$(hostname)_*.log <dir>``) or inside a BRACE GROUP

      substitution wherever it sits, and the word itself is a filename bash never

    ``<`` branch has always looked for its operator ANYWHERE in the word; this is the same
    rule for the ``>`` family, and that asymmetry was the gap.

    The word is SPLIT rather than skipped, because what precedes the redirect decides the
    answer and only the caller's own branches can classify it: ``-u`` is a flag and the
    scan continues, but ``script.py>out`` means the script supplies the program and the
    answer is False. Measured in bash: ``python script.py> out <<< '<program>'`` runs the

    ``python 2>&1 <<< '<program>'`` runs the here-string, but the detector had no branch
    for the ``>`` family at all: it handles ``<`` and heredocs off the raw token and let
    everything else fall through to "this is a script path". The unnumbered glued form
    only survived by accident, because ``_normalize_operand`` reduces ``>out.txt`` to the
    empty string and the loop skips empties -- while ``2>&1`` reduces to ``2``, a
    perfectly good file name, so the interpreter looked like it was running a script
    called ``2`` and the program on its stdin went unscanned.

    Every spelling is a redirect and none is ever a positional: an optional leading file
    DESCRIPTOR -- a number, ``&`` for both streams, or a ``{name}`` automatic descriptor
    -- then ``>`` or ``>>``, then an optional ``&`` for the duplicating form or ``|`` for
    the noclobber override.

    The target STOPS at the next redirect operator, and *end* is that position, because
    the shell starts a new redirect there: in ``python 2>/dev/null<<EOF`` the word is one
    token, and taking all of ``/dev/null<<EOF`` as the target swallows the heredoc marker
    and loses the program that arrives on stdin.

    Only at substitution depth ZERO, though. A redirect inside ``$(...)``, ``${...}`` or
    backticks belongs to that inner command and is not a boundary of this word:
    ``python 2>$(echo>/dev/null;printf /dev/null) <<< '<program>'`` really is
    ``python 2>/dev/null`` once the shell has run the substitution, and cutting the target
    at the inner ``>`` left the tail of the substitution to be read as a script path,
    which put the stdin program back out of view. The whole substitution is one shell
    WORD, and :func:`_operand_span_end` is what carries it across the tokens it spans.

    Depth counts every ``(`` and ``{`` INSIDE a substitution, but at depth zero only a
    ``$``-prefixed opener starts one. A subshell nested inside a substitution
    (``$( (true); printf /dev/null)``) closes with its own ``)`` -- counting the opener
    but not that one would drop the depth to zero early and reopen exactly the hole
    this closes. A BARE opener at depth zero is different: the tokenizer that feeds
    this scan strips quotes (``_self_token_frames`` shlex-splits, and the caller also
    edge-strips), so a quoted ``(`` -- one filename character to bash -- arrived here
    bare, opened a span that never closed, and the target ran past the ``<<<`` that
    should have ended it. The here-string was absorbed into the target and the program
    arriving on stdin went unscanned: measured in bash, ``python 2>'a)(b'<<<'<program>'``
    runs the program, and so does the unquoted-brace spelling ``python 2>a{b<<<'<program>'``
    (a bare ``{`` is an ordinary filename character). An UNQUOTED bare ``(`` cannot
    reach execution at all -- bash rejects ``2>a(b`` as a syntax error -- so at depth
    zero the only executable meaning of a bare opener is a filename character, and the
    walk now reads it as one. *raw* must reach here with its substitution delimiters
    intact; see the caller.

    Quote CHARACTERS in *raw* are data, never grammar. The tokenizer resolved quoting
    before this scan runs, so a quote character that survives is literal text from a
    spelling like ``2>"a'b"`` -- and reading it as grammar is the same defect in the
    opposite direction: a single-quote state opened on that data quote consumed the
    ``<<<`` to the end of the text and hid the operator (found in review, First
    Principles lane). The walk therefore steps over quote characters like any other
    filename character. Residuals, tracked rather than chased: a quoted ``'$('`` or
    a quoted backtick in a filename de-quotes to the same characters as real grammar
    and still holds or toggles a span -- indistinguishable without the quoting the
    tokenizer already destroyed, and closing that class needs quote-preserving
    tokenization at the frame level, not another rule here.

    An INDEX is returned rather than the remaining text so a word holding a chain of
    them (``>a>a>a...``) can be walked once. Re-slicing the word per operator was
    quadratic in its length, on a floor that runs for every command -- the same defect
    class this module pins against elsewhere, so it is not reintroduced here.

    """Remove ``\\<newline>`` exactly where a shell removes it -- quote-aware.

    A shell folds a backslash-newline while lexing, so ``"r\\<newline>m" -rf /``
    runs ``rm -rf /``.  The deny tiers match text and ``_split_segments`` cuts on
    the newline, so without folding the continuation is severed before any view is
    built and every rule authored as a command shape misses that spelling.

    ``_shell_join_continuations`` above looks like the answer and is NOT: it is a
    bare regex that folds inside SINGLE quotes too, and its comment scopes it
    deliberately to the self-protection floor's tokenizer input rather than to the
    matched text of the whole catalog.  Applying it here would fold
    ``echo 'r\\<newline>m -rf /'`` -- which bash prints literally -- into a denial.

    The contexts were measured against bash rather than assumed (``printf %q`` on
    the resulting argv):

    ======================  ==================  ========
    spelling                bash argv           folded?
    ======================  ==================  ========
    ``A\\<nl>A BB``          ``<AA><BB>``        yes
    ``"A\\<nl>A" BB``        ``<AA><BB>``        yes
    ``'A\\<nl>A' BB``        ``<A\\<nl>A><BB>``   no
    ``$'A\\<nl>A' BB``       ``<A\\<nl>A><BB>``   no
    ``A\\<cr><nl>A BB``      ``<A\\r>`` + new cmd  no
    ======================  ==================  ========

    So: fold unquoted and inside double quotes; preserve inside single quotes and
    inside ANSI-C (``$'…'``) spans.  ``$"…"`` follows the double-quote rule, which
    falls out of the scan because only ``$'`` opens a preserving span.

    Only a BARE newline ends a continuation.  A ``\\`` before ``\\r\\n`` escapes the
    CR into a literal carriage return and the LF then ends the command, so the two
    lines stay apart -- see :func:`_continuation_width`.

    Runs BEFORE the ANSI-C decode, which is the shell's own order: continuations
    are removed while lexing, and the escape body is interpreted after -- so a
    preserved ``\\<newline>`` inside ``$'…'`` stays part of that literal.

    An unterminated quote simply runs to the end in that state; the scan never
    raises, because it feeds the permission gate.

    *open_end*, walked QUOTE-AWARELY through :func:`_iter_shell_chars`.

    THE one span computation for a substitution or subshell body. Both the
    git-publish boundary walk and the nested-payload EXTRACTOR read it, because a
    body extracted over a different span than the boundary proved is exactly how a
    nested command escapes the scan: ``git push origin my-feature > >(X=')' git
    push origin main)`` truncated the extracted body at the QUOTED ``)``, so the
    payload came back as ``X='`` and the nested publish of a protected branch was
    never scanned at all -- ``is_denied`` allowed a command bash runs.

    Quoting is not the only way a ``)`` reaches this walk as an ordinary
    character. Two COMMAND-GRAMMAR constructs put one there too, and each was
    measured allowing a payload this module still refuses:

    * a ``#`` COMMENT runs to the end of its line, so the ``)`` in
      ``$(: # )`` is commented out and the substitution closes on a LATER line.
      Counting it closed the body at ``: # ``, and the ``printf`` behind it that
      computed the credential-minting verb was never scanned.
    * a ``case`` PATTERN is terminated by ``)``. In
      ``$(case x in x) printf token;; esac)`` the pattern's ``)`` is not the
      substitution's, and reading it as one truncated the body to ``case x in x``.

    Between ``case`` and its ``esac`` both parens are therefore ignored, which
    keeps a ``(x|y)`` pattern balanced-neutral as well. ARMING is generous and
    DISARMING is strict on purpose: missing a real ``case`` closes the body EARLY,
    which is the bypass, while missing a real ``esac`` only runs it long, which is
    imprecision. So ``case`` arms on any standalone word IN COMMAND POSITION
    (:func:`_arms_case_context` -- bash only reads the reserved word there, so
    ``echo case x in y`` does not arm on ordinary commands, and every
    undecidable position still arms) and ``esac`` disarms only in command
    position -- an ``esac`` passed to a command as an ARGUMENT would otherwise
    end the rule early and let the next paren close.

    ``proven`` is False when the parens never balance before the text ends. The
    caller must fail CLOSED on that: for an extractor the safe reading is the
    whole remainder (scan more, never less). All three call sites are extractors,
    so a span that reaches too far only feeds them text to inspect.

    ``mainline)>log`` -- which ends in ``g``, so stripping removed nothing and the
    ref never equalled ``mainline``. bash parses that as the ref ``mainline``
    followed by the operator ``)`` and the redirection ``>log``, so cutting at the
    first operator is what reproduces its reading.

    Quote state is TRACKED rather than bailed on. Inside quotes these characters
    are literal and a ref may legitimately contain them -- ``git push origin
    '(main)'`` targets a branch actually named ``(main)``, which is not protected
    and must stay pushable. But a quoted ref can still carry an operator OUTSIDE
    its quotes: ``(git push origin 'main')`` hands the ref token ``'main')``,
    whose trailing ``)`` is unquoted. Returning early on the mere PRESENCE of a
    quote left that ``)`` in place, so the ref resolved to ``main)``, never
    equalled ``main``, and the protected push was allowed AND audited as a
    feature-branch push -- reopening the exact class this cut exists to close.
    Cutting only at operators outside quotes satisfies both readings at once.

    An UNBALANCED quote leaves the remainder read as quoted, so nothing is cut.
    That is safe because such a token is not executable as written: bash has an
    unterminated quote and never runs the push. If a later quote in the command
    balances it, the shell folds the span into one word whose ref likewise no
    longer equals a protected name.

    Quotes are PRESERVED in the result; both call sites remove them afterwards
    (see ``_dequote_token``), which is what keeps ``'(main)'`` a literal ref.

    Escapes are honoured through the shared walk, so ``ma\\)in`` keeps its

    -- N frames each costing an O(N) tokenize and an O(N) join. Measured on
    ``"eval " * 1280``: 65 s and growing ~5x per doubling, against 0.13 s before
    the join existed, which stalls the synchronous permission gate long enough for
    the watchdog to fire. Declining the second join costs no detection, because
    the join FUSES already-dequoted words in one step -- ``eval eval 'git' 'push
    origin main'`` is fused to ``git push origin main`` by the first join, so the

    re-derive suffixes of an answer already in hand.
