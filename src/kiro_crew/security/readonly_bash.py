"""Read-only bash classifier: the last gate before a shell command auto-approves.

``is_read_only_bash`` / ``unsafe_bash_reason`` decide whether a shell command is
read-only, and therefore whether it may run with no human prompt under
``--approval reads`` / trust-reads and in ``hooks.on_tool_call``'s read-only
auto-approve branch. Deny-by-default: a command has to be RECOGNISED as read-only
by the tables here, and anything unrecognised prompts.

The rest of the module is the argument semantics that verdict rests on -- the
prefix allowlist, the per-verb write/exec/indirection flag tables, the git ref and
remote subcommand rules, the positive option accept-lists for tools with a small
enough surface (``sort``, ``date``, ``file``, ``hostname``), and the shell-expansion
readers that decide whether a token's real spelling is knowable before it runs.
Every table carries the measurement that put its entries there.

Self-contained on purpose: nothing here reads dashboard state, and the two
consumers (``dashboard.chat_runner`` for the approval flow, ``hooks`` for the
auto-approve branch) import it at module top.

#
# `more` did NOT fire on util-linux, which has no `+command`. It is listed anyway
# because on the BSDs `more` is not a separate program: FreeBSD's
# `usr.bin/less/Makefile` installs it as a link (`LINKS= ${BINDIR}/less
# ${BINDIR}/more`), and Apple's `less/main.c` detects the name at startup:

# `|` pipe-to-shell, `v` editor, `s` save-to-file), because enumerating them is the

# Words bash DELETES before exec, which `shlex.split` keeps. The token list this

# with an empty file named `--list` present for the redirect form:
#
#     git branch injected # --list     -> CREATED the branch
#     git tag forged # --list          -> CREATED the tag
#     git branch injected < --list     -> CREATED the branch
#     git branch injected <<< --list   -> CREATED the branch
#
# In each case `shlex` supplied a `--list` that put the segment in list mode, so
# the operand walk read `injected` as a pattern instead of a ref to create.
#
# WHY THIS IS PER VERB AND NOT A GLOBAL REFUSAL. A phantom word can only ADD to the
# token list. For a verb decided by its FLAGS, an added word is either inert or gets
# read as a flag it does not have, so the worst case is an extra prompt: safe. Only a
# verb decided by POSITION or MODE can be flipped, because there the count and the
# order of the words carry the decision. Refusing globally cost five ordinary reads
# that no phantom word could have made unsafe (`wc -l < f`, `grep TODO < f`,
# `cat < f`, `wc -l <f`, `head -20 < log.txt`), which is a worse trade than the
# narrower rule.
#
# WHY REFUSE RATHER THAN STRIP THE REDIRECT. Stripping the operator and its target
# looks equivalent and is not: `shlex` has already discarded the quoting, so a token
# beginning with `<` is indistinguishable from a QUOTED argument that begins with
# `<`. Stripping would drop a word bash keeps, and for exactly these verbs that
# opens a hole rather than closing one: `git branch '<new'` reaches `shlex` as
# `[git, branch, <new]`, and dropping `<new` leaves a bare `git branch` that reads
# as a listing while bash creates the ref. Refusing fails closed without
# reimplementing bash's quoting rules, which this module deliberately does not do.

#     `git branch --color newbranch` still creates `newbranch` — while the guard
#     read `newbranch` as the colour and passed the segment.
#   * whether the command is in LIST mode, where an operand is a pattern to match
#     rather than a ref to create. `git branch --list newbranch` lists, it does
#     not create, so treating that operand as a creation would be a false denial.

# `date`'s read-only surface. Enumerated from GNU coreutils `date --help`, then
# checked for a second axis the other accept-lists did not have to face: whether the
# same LETTER means different things in different `date` implementations.
#
# `-d` IS on the list, and the reason it is here is worth recording because an earlier
# revision of this change left it OFF on the belief that BSD/macOS `date -d` sets the
# kernel's daylight-saving value. That belief came from documentation, not from the
# implementations, and checking the implementations showed it is false on every
# platform that ships today. Read from each project's own `getopt(3)` string:
#
#   GNU coreutils      `-d STRING`  parses and PRINTS  (verified by execution, 8.22)
#   FreeBSD  bin/date  "f:I::jnRr:uv:z:"   no `d` at all -> invalid option
#   Apple    shell_cmds/date  "f:I::jnRr:uv:z:"   no `d` at all -> invalid option
#   OpenBSD  bin/date  "af:jr:uz:"         no `d` at all -> invalid option
#   NetBSD   bin/date  "ad:f:jnRr:Uuz:"    `-d` sets rflag and parsedate()s optarg,
#                                          i.e. the GNU meaning: a reference time to
#                                          PRINT. `setthetime()` is reached only from
#                                          a bare operand, never from `-d`.
#
# So `-d` either reads or errors, never writes. The historical `-d dst` that set the
# kernel daylight-saving flag is gone from every current BSD.
#
# There was also an internal tell that should have caught this without the source
# dive: `--date=` was already on the read-only long list, and `-d` is the same option
# under a shorter spelling on every implementation that has it. Admitting one and
# refusing the other could not both be right.
#
# `-s`/`--set` IS the setter GNU shares, verified accepted and failing only on
# privilege ("date: cannot set date: Operation not permitted"). `-f`, `-r`, `-I` and
# `-d` take values, which is what makes `-Iseconds`, `-r FILE` and `-d yesterday` read
# cleanly while `-s` is refused -- the dilemma that kept `-s` out of the old
# write-flag table.
#
# The other three accept-lists were swept for divergence and need no change: BSD
# `sort`'s writers are `-o`/`-T` and BSD `file`'s is `-C`, all already excluded, and
# BSD `hostname` offers only `-f`/`-s` plus a name OPERAND, which `operands="none"`
# already refuses. BSD `date`'s other setters (`-t` minutes west, `-j`, `-n`, `-v`)
# are likewise absent from this list, so they fail closed already.

# `file`'s surface, from its own `--help`. It reached an accept-list rather than a
# `-C` denylist entry because that is the shape this change keeps converging on: an
# unlisted option prompts instead of passing, so a flag missing from the help text
# costs a prompt rather than a write. `git blame --textconv` is the reason that
# distinction is not academic.
#
# `-C/--compile` is the setter: with `-m FILE` it compiles that magic file and writes
# `FILE.mgc` beside it (verified, 464 bytes). `-z/--uncompress` is ALSO excluded, on
# the omission-is-cheap principle rather than a measured escape -- libmagic can shell
# out to an external decompressor for formats it does not handle internally, and the
# flag is rare enough that a prompt costs nothing. Everything else prints.
# `f`/`--files-from` is absent, and for a different reason than `-C`: it does not
# write, it INDIRECTS. `file -f LIST` opens every path named inside LIST, and those
# paths never appear in the command, so the hook layer's path gates
# (`is_sensitive_path` / `is_sensitive_bash_command`, applied to the command text) see
# only LIST and cannot see what is actually read. A guard that inspects argv is blind
# to one more level of indirection, so the option has to go rather than the guard get
# cleverer. `sort --files0-from` was already excluded for the same shape; `hostname -F`
# is already refused as a setter.
#
# Kept: `-m/--magic-file`, `-e/--exclude`, `-F/--separator` all take a value, but the
# value IS the path or string being used, visible in argv, so the guards can act on it.
# There is no indirection to hide behind.
#
# `p`/`--preserve-date` is absent too, and it is the subtlest of the three exclusions.
# It LOOKS read-only because it RESTORES the access time rather than setting a caller
# chosen one -- which is how it was originally, and wrongly, admitted here. Restoring
# still requires a `utimes()` call on the named path, and the `ctime` that call bumps is
# NOT restorable. So the option erases the evidence that a file was read while leaving a
# permanent metadata modification behind: the wrong side of read-only in both directions.
#
# MEASURED, because `noatime` on this box hides the atime effect entirely and made the
# obvious test inconclusive. `ctime` advances on any inode metadata write and is visible
# whatever the mount options are:
#
#   file t.txt            -> ctime unchanged   (control)
#   file -b t.txt         -> ctime unchanged   (control)
#   file -p t.txt         -> ctime ADVANCED
#   file --preserve-date  -> ctime ADVANCED
#
# The same probe was then run over every other accept-list flag that opens a named file
# -- `file -m/-k/-L/-s/-r`, `sort`, `sort -u`, `sort -k1`, `date -r`, `date -f`, plus
# `cat` and `wc -l` as controls -- and all twelve are clean. `-p` is the only one.
#
# `-z`/`--uncompress` is also absent, and it belongs to a class this module already
# names elsewhere rather than to the write-flag class. From `file`'s own
# `src/compress.c`, the decompressor is SPAWNED:
#
#     status = posix_spawnp(&pid, compr[method].argv[0], &fa, NULL, ...)
#
# with `compr[]` holding `"gzip"`, `"bzip2"`, `"lzip"`, `"xz"`, `"lrzip"`, `"zstd"` and
# `method` selected from the examined file's magic bytes. So `-z` runs a program whose
# NAME is chosen by the content being inspected, which is the same hand-off as
# `git diff --ext-diff`. Stated because it is a behaviour change: on the write-flag
# table `file -z` auto-approved, and under this list it prompts.
