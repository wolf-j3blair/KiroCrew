def _deny_segment_views(segment: str, emit_self: bool = True) -> tuple[str, ...]:
    """The views of ONE shell segment that the deny tiers are matched against.

    *segment* arrives with its ORIGINAL CASE, and every view returned is
    lowercased.  Case matters for exactly one step: bash's Unicode escape widths
    are case-sensitive (``\\u`` up to 4 hex digits, ``\\U`` up to 8), so decoding
    after a ``lower()`` would read ``$'\\u0072f'`` -- which bash passes as ``rf`` --
    as a single 5-digit code point and miss the rule.  The decode therefore runs
    FIRST, on the text as written, and the lowercasing happens after.

    The first element is always the raw text (lowercased) -- matched exactly as it
    was before this helper existed -- so nothing that was denied can stop being
    denied.  Quote/escape-NORMALIZED re-joins are APPENDED when they differ.

    *emit_self* False walks NESTED PAYLOADS ONLY, emitting no view for *segment*
    itself.  That is how the whole command is inspected without joining across its
    separators: ``_split_segments`` is deliberately quote-unaware, so a newline
    inside a quoted payload (``bash -c 'r\\<newline>m -rf /'``) severs the command
    into pieces before the payload can be extracted from it -- while re-joining the
    whole command would fabricate a command that never ran.  Walking it for
    payloads without emitting its own re-join gets the first without the second.

    ── Why the extra view is needed ──
    Both deny tiers match TEXT, and a shell removes quoting, escaping and
    empty-string splices and collapses whitespace runs before the program ever
    sees its argv.  So every rule authored as a command SHAPE (``rm -rf /``,
    ``dd if=``, ``chmod 777``) was defeated by re-spelling any one token:
    ``rm -rf "/"``, ``"rm" -rf /``, ``'rm' -rf /``, ``rm "-rf" /``,
    ``r''m -rf /`` and ``rm  -rf /`` all run the identical command and none of
    them CONTAINS the pattern's own text.  Of the ~140 built-in rules only the
    six self-protection rules and git-publish had an argv-structural floor
    closing this (see ``_SELF_PROTECTION_FLOOR_PATTERNS``); every other rule was
    spelling-dependent.

    ── Why the tokenizer is ``_shell_tokens`` and not ``normalize_shell_command``
    Both share one tokenizer, but the deny view deliberately stops BEFORE
    ``~``/``$HOME`` expansion, for two reasons.  Expansion is
    platform-dependent, so it would make the view decide differently per host:
    it DELETES the literal ``~`` that ``rm -rf ~.*`` is authored to match, and
    on Windows it yields a drive path (``c:\\users\\…``) that no POSIX-anchored
    rule matches — so ``rm -rf "~"`` would be caught on Linux by the sibling
    ``rm -rf /.*`` rule and missed on Windows.  And a denied view becomes the
    security event log's ``operation`` field, so expanding here would write the
    operator's real home path into the audit trail on every such denial.  Path
    IDENTITY (dot segments, ``..``, ``$HOME`` versus the resolved home) is
    already decided by ``is_sensitive_path`` against the
    sensitive-path keystone, which is the layer that resolves rather than
    matches; this view answers only the narrower question of what the shell
    hands over as argv.

    ── Why this is a per-SEGMENT view, never a whole-command one ──
    Re-joining tokens with single spaces erases the separators a shell uses to
    END a command, so normalizing the whole input would FABRICATE a command that
    was never run: ``echo rm`` + newline + ``-rf /`` is two commands, and a
    whole-input re-join reads as ``echo rm -rf /``.  The heredoc frames pinned by
    ``TestStdinProgramTextScoping.test_benign_neighbour_no_longer_reads_as_a_mint``
    are the concrete case.  Segments come from ``_split_segments``, so no boundary
    is ever crossed — including inside a nested payload, which is split the same
    way before being viewed.

    ── Nested shell payloads ──
    A shell's ``-c`` argument is a COMMAND, and ``shlex`` strips only the OUTER
    quoting level, so ``bash -c 'dd "if=/dev/zero" of=/dev/sda'`` re-joins with
    its inner quotes intact and the ``dd if=`` rule still does not match.
    Each literal payload is
    therefore walked and viewed in its own right, reusing
    :func:`_nested_shell_payloads` — the extractor the self-protection floor
    already uses, so the ``-c`` / ``eval`` / ``env -S`` / herestring /
    ``$SHELL -c`` spellings and the ``bash -c -- <script>`` form are recognized
    here by construction rather than re-enumerated.  Only LITERAL payloads exist
    to walk: ``eval "$CMD"`` carries no visible script and stays the raw tier's
    job.

    The walk takes NO numeric depth cap, for the reason
    :func:`_self_token_frames` records: whatever the number, one more wrapper
    defeats it.  It terminates structurally instead — a payload is carried inside
    ONE token of its parent, so it is strictly shorter than the parent's source
    text, and a chain of strictly shorter strings is finite.

    ── Fail-closed, and it never raises ──
    This only ever ADDS views.  ``_shell_tokens`` already degrades to whitespace
    splitting with quote stripping when ``shlex`` rejects the input (so even an
    unbalanced-quote segment still normalizes), and every window is built inside a
    guard: this runs in the permission gate, where an exception is a crash rather
    than a security decision, so a failure drops that window and leaves the raw
    view standing.  A failure can therefore lose the EXTRA match but never the raw
    one, so it cannot turn a denied command into an allowed one.

    ── Residual ──
    Three shapes stay outside every view.  A token split by BOTH quoting and a
    separator-shaped glue construct (``"rm"$(echo ' ')-rf /``) is in none of them:
    the raw text is not contiguous and the glue lands on its own segment — the
    whole-string raw pass covers the glue-ONLY spelling (``git$(echo ' ')push``),
    and closing the combination needs a normalizer that models substitution,
    which a re-join is not.  A variable spelling of a path operand
    (``rm -rf $HOME``) is by construction not expanded here, per the note above.
    And a quoted WHITESPACE-ONLY word (``rm -rf " " /home/x``) still renders an
    extra separator.  Adding a render without it would be additive like the one
    above and so could not lose a denial, but it is not the same claim: an empty
    element carries no characters, so a view without it is still the argv the
    shell hands over; a whitespace-only element is a real operand naming a file
    that can exist, so a view without it is an argv ONE OPERAND SHORT of the one
    that runs.  Widening the render to elements that do carry characters changes
    what a view is permitted to assert -- and ``is_denied``'s perm-verb-mention
    narrowing is matched against views, so the direction it would open is ALLOW,
    not deny.  Recognizing this shape wants
    rules matched against argv STRUCTURE rather than against a rendered line,
    which is what ``_SELF_PROTECTION_FLOOR_PATTERNS`` already does for the six
    self-protection rules — and is why those are not fooled by either shape.

            # single-space join turns a zero-width element into a spurious extra
            # separator, and every rule authored as a command shape with single
            # separators (``rm -rf /``, ``dd if=``) then stops matching its own
            # target -- ``rm -rf "" /home/x`` rendered as ``rm -rf  /home/x``.
            # The element contributes no text to the shape and cannot name a file
            # or carry a flag, so a view without it renders what the command does
            # rather than fabricating something it does not.
            #
            # Keeping the plain join is not defensive tidiness.  A rule that
            # REQUIRES an intervening token (``rm -rf .* ./data``) matched the
            # double-spaced view and matches neither the elided one nor the
            # command's canonical spelling, so dropping it removed a denial that
            # existed: ``r""m -rf "" ./data`` was refused and became
            # allowed (reproduced against the
            # merge-base).  Emitting both means a rule authored against either
            # whitespace shape still fires, which is the only reading that cannot
            # lose a denial.  Rules whose own pattern already tolerated the extra
            # separator (``chmod.*/etc/.*``) were denying via the plain view all
            # along, which is why the escape was pattern-dependent rather than

    Returns denial reason string, or None if allowed.

    ── Two tiers ──
    * Regex tier (``denied_regexes``): the effective enabled built-in rule
      regexes plus user-added regexes (output of ``compute_effective_denied``),
      matched via ``re.search`` (``re.IGNORECASE``).  When ``None``, FAILS
      CLOSED to all built-ins enabled.
    * Glob tier (``extra_patterns``): legacy ``auto_deny_tools`` + companion
      overlay globs, matched via ``fnmatch`` exactly as before.

    ── Two-pass evaluation ──
    Pass 1 (whole-string): every deny pattern is matched against the
    full input.  If a pattern matches and **no exception pattern also
    matches the full input**, the input is denied immediately.  This
    closes evasion vectors where the deny string spans a separator
    boundary that per-segment splitting would erase, e.g.
    ``git$(echo ' ')push origin main`` (which bash evaluates to
    ``git push origin main``): the whole string contains both ``git`` and
    ``push`` so the broad ``*git*push*`` glob matches, and there is no
    matching exception, so the command is denied at this stage even
    though splitting on ``$(`` / ``)`` would otherwise produce no
    segment containing both substrings.

    Pass 2 (per-segment) only runs if pass 1 found a deny match **and**
    the full input also matched at least one exception for that pattern.
    The input is split on shell command separators (``;``, ``&&``,
    ``||``, ``|``, newlines) and command-substitution boundaries
    (``$(``, ``)``, backticks) into segments, and each segment is
    re-evaluated independently.  This preserves the chaining-bypass
    protection (any embedded real
    publish lives in its own segment and matches the deny pattern in its
    own right) while allowing the legitimate stash-in-pipeline case
    that the prior whole-string design over-blocked.

    Edge cases & limitations:
      - Pass-1 deny is conservative: anything matching a deny glob with
        no exception is blocked, even if the input is structurally
        contorted.
      - Pass-2 splitting is purely textual; quoted strings and escaped
        separators are split anyway (over-blocking is the safer
        direction).
      - Each pass-2 segment is matched in TWO views: the raw text, then a
        quote/escape-normalized re-join of that segment
        (``_deny_segment_views``), so a rule authored as a command shape is
        not defeated by re-quoting a token (``rm -rf "/"``), splicing one
        (``r''m -rf /``) or padding the whitespace.  Strictly additive, and
        never applied across a separator — see that helper.
      - Heredoc bodies, ``eval``, ``bash -c``, etc., are not parsed
        specially.  If those become evasion vectors in practice, add
        explicit deny patterns for them.

    Audit:
      - Every denial path emits a ``deny_event`` SEL event via
        ``_emit_deny_event``.
      - Every granted exception emits a ``deny_exception`` SEL event via
        ``_emit_deny_exception_event`` (fail-closed: if SEL logging
        fails the exception is not granted).

    Args:
        tool_name: The full command line / tool invocation to evaluate.
        extra_patterns: Optional fnmatch glob patterns (glob tier — legacy
            ``auto_deny_tools`` + companion overlay).
        denied_regexes: The effective enabled rule regexes (regex tier).  When
            ``None``, fails closed to all built-in rules enabled.
        reason_notes: Optional ``{pattern: operator note}`` map.  When the pattern
            that matched has a note, the note is appended to the refusal on its
            OWN line.  Presentation only — it never affects whether something is
            denied.

    Returns:
        Denial reason string (mentioning the matched pattern), or
        ``None`` if the input is allowed.

    """Evaluate a SYNTHESIZED target against the patterns that participate in one.

    A synthesized target is not a command line.  It is a ``"<namespace> key=value ..."``
    summary this gate mints from a tool call's structured arguments so a rule can see a
    scope that exists nowhere in text (``hooks._search_deny_target``).  Handing it to
    :func:`is_denied` evaluates it against the WHOLE shared rule set, including the ~140
    command-oriented built-ins -- and those match its path text incidentally: the
    ``mkfs.*`` rule denies a read-only search of a directory named ``mkfs-tests``.  The
    only per-rule remedy is disabling that rule by id, which also stops it protecting
    real shell commands, so the collision costs a real control to clear.

    Which patterns participate: exactly the ones the CALLER passes.  The hooks gate
    passes the operator's own enabled regexes, and the companion overlay is evaluated
    separately and unscoped a layer up (``PolicyAuthority``).  The shipped built-in
    catalogue is NOT passed and takes no part in a synthesized target: a built-in cannot
    express a scope rule for one -- none is authored against the grammar, ratcheted by
    ``test_no_shipped_builtin_is_authored_against_the_grammar`` -- so its only possible
    hit here is the incidental one this tier exists to drop.  A future built-in written
    against the grammar fails that ratchet, which is the signal to give it an explicit
    way in.

    This is deliberately a caller-supplied SET rather than a filter applied here.  An
    earlier revision classified the merged effective set by testing each pattern's text
    against the shipped catalogue, and text cannot answer that question: an operator who
    authors a pattern whose text coincides with a shipped one (``mkfs.*`` is a natural
    thing to type) had their OWN rule read as shipped and dropped -- a silent fail-open on
    an explicit deny.  Pattern text is not provenance.  Passing only what participates
    makes provenance structural: there is nothing left to misclassify.

    What this does NOT run, and why:

    * The argv-structural floors (credential mint, self-kill, restart/update/cloud) and
      the verb-anchored git-publish detector.  Each interprets SHELL SYNTAX, and a
      synthesized target has none: its tokens are the namespace and ``key=value`` pairs,
      values are whitespace-encoded by the synthesizer so one cannot split into two
      tokens, and no such target can name a program.  A search of a tree cannot mint a
      credential or kill a process, so these can only produce false positives here.  A
      real command still reaches them through its own ``command`` target.
    * Per-segment (pass 2) re-evaluation.  Segment splitting exists to isolate a chained
      command inside one shell line; a synthesized target has no chaining semantics, so
      splitting it only manufactures pseudo-commands out of path substrings -- the same
      collision class, one layer down.

    Args:
        target: The synthesized target, e.g. ``"file-search path=/srv max_depth=3"``.
        patterns: Regex-tier patterns that participate (the operator's own).  ``None``
            or empty means the regex tier contributes nothing -- NOT that it falls back
            to every built-in, which would be the opposite of this tier's contract.
        extra_patterns: Glob-tier patterns that participate (``auto_deny_tools``).
        reason_notes: Optional ``{pattern: operator note}`` map, presentation only.

    Returns:
        Denial reason string (mentioning the matched pattern), or ``None`` if allowed.

    :func:`memory_stores_declared_names`. Every store is listed, including one with no
    ``memory.db``: a silo-bound crew's lesson WRITES land in this file precisely when
    that silo has no vector store (``dashboard.handlers.cron._lesson_jsonl_store`` routes
    by BINDING, and ``ContextBuilder.get_lessons_for`` creates only the markdown
    directory), and ``LessonStore.get_context`` injects those rows into that crew's
    prompt as ``[Learned corrections]``. So this is the tier an audit of vector files
    alone reports "clean" about while it is the only populated, prompt-injected tier the
    install has.

    Each path comes from :class:`learn.LessonStore` itself rather than from a composed
    ``<dir>/lessons.jsonl``, so the audit reads the exact file the writer writes.

    A named store's directory is taken from the vector path this audit already trusts:
    ``resolve_store_path(name).parent`` is the directory ``ensure_memory_store_dir``
    hands the writer, and ``named_store_of_db`` is the same positive attribution gate the
    vector pass applies — ``resolve_store_path`` DEGRADES rather than raising, so without
    it a config save landing mid-scan would resolve the operator's OWN
    ``lessons.jsonl`` under a crew's name and print the operator's corrections as that
    crew's. The resolved path is re-checked against that directory afterwards because
    ``LessonStore.__init__`` has fallbacks of its own; a store whose file lands outside
    its own directory is not audited rather than misattributed.

    Never raises. A store that cannot be resolved is dropped with a warning, which is
    fail-soft on the ENUMERATION only — a file that resolves and then will not open is a
    finding, not a silence (see :func:`_scan_store_lessons`).

    """Injection findings for ONE store's lessons file, each attributed to *store_name*.

    *path* is opened DIRECTLY, never through the agent file gate: a named store's
    lessons file is inside the keystone ``memory_stores/`` subtree, so
    ``is_sensitive_path`` is True for it. That is the established keystone-reader pattern
    (see ``docs/system-specs/modules/security.md`` and
    ``docs/architecture/security-deep-dive.md``) — a legitimate reader opens the path
    itself, because relaxing the fence for this one caller would unfence the subtree for
    every tool caller too.

    An ABSENT file is not a finding: a store's lessons tier appears at the first
    correction, so absence is the ordinary state of a fresh store rather than a failure.
    Any OTHER read failure IS one, because the whole file is a directive tier and "I
    could not look" must not render as a tick.

    Screens ``rule`` and ``negative`` — the two fields ``LessonStore.get_context``
    renders into the prompt — with the SAME predicate the vector tiers use, so widening
    the surface does not widen what counts as a finding. Every syntactically valid row is
    screened, including one carrying a ``repo_scope`` that ``load_all`` drops: an audit
    has no project to evaluate a scope against, and poisoned text sitting in this file is
    reportable wherever a context build would have rendered it.

    ONE finding per ROW, on the first matching field. The row is the unit of removal, so
    a row poisoned in both fields is one thing for a reader to act on rather than two
    findings sharing a key and inflating the count.

    Reads the file whole. ``LessonStore`` itself loads and rewrites it whole on every
    save and prunes it to a bounded row count, so the whole file already IS the
    production working set — and a row-count bound here would be a blind spot an
    attacker could append past.

    The excerpt is NOT redacted, matching the vector passes exactly: they surface
    ``value_json`` and ``text`` as stored, and a report that redacted one tier but not
    another would read as though the tiers held different classes of content.

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Facade machinery
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The security controls are split by responsibility across submodules of this
# package, and ``kiro_crew.security`` stays the only import path: every name a
# submodule owns is re-exported here, private helpers included, because callers
# and tests reach them as attributes of the package and patch them by dotted
# string. Two properties have to hold for that to keep being true after a name
# moves out of this file.
#
# 1. A read here answers with the object the owning submodule holds. Resolving it
#    through the owner on each access is what makes that true by construction
#    rather than by a copy that agrees at import and can drift afterwards. The
#    frozen list in ``_exports`` is what keeps the set of names checkable.
# 2. Setting the attribute HERE reaches the owning submodule. A caller inside
#    that submodule resolves the name through its own globals, so a patch
#    applied only here would leave it running the unpatched object -- the test
#    passes while testing nothing. ``_ReExportModule`` below is what closes that,
#    so every existing patch site stays as written.
#
# Both halves resolve the owner with ``importlib.import_module``, which answers
# from ``sys.modules``. That leaves one place a value lives (the owner's
# namespace) and one place a module lives (``sys.modules``), so neither half has
# a second copy to keep in step.
#
# The table below is in dependency order, lowest layer first, and a name belongs
# to the submodule that DEFINES it. Names this module imports for its own use
# from outside the package -- the standard library, and other ``kiro_crew``
# modules -- are not in the table: no submodule of this package owns them, so
# there is no owner to resolve them through, and they stay ordinary attributes of
# this module.

#: Re-exported name -> the submodule that DEFINES it, the one place its value
#: lives. Read from here by ``__getattr__``, so the facade binds none of these
#: names in its own namespace.

    otherwise reroute every read of every security gate here to that patch for as

    A name outside the table raises ``AttributeError``, the answer a caller and

    That makes such a write undoable, which matters for the restore-by-reassign
