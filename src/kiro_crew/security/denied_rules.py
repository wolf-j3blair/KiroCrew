"""The built-in denied-command catalog, its linear matcher and the evaluator seam.

The catalog is the configurable tier: every row is DEFAULT-ON, user-disableable
from the security settings surface, and force-pinnable by a governance policy.
That makes it the opposite of the keystone in ``paths`` -- a row here can be
turned off, so nothing that must always hold may live here alone.

Three things in this module are load bearing beyond their own tier.

The floor id sets and pattern tables are DERIVED from catalog categories rather
than hand-maintained, so a new row in a floor-enforced category is covered
automatically and the pattern set and id set cannot drift apart. They are read
by the argv-structural floor, which owns no catalog knowledge of its own.

The matcher exists because the rule patterns were authored for a linear-time
(RE2-style) engine and are not safe to hand to a backtracking engine verbatim.
It is an EVALUATION-layer rewrite only: the catalog rows, and the golden fixture
the parity test pins to, stay byte-for-byte what they were, and a refusal still
reports the original pattern.

The refusal producer is the single place refusal text is formed. Its first line
is frozen because two consumers parse it, one of them with a per-line
end-anchored regex; an operator note therefore goes on a second line, which both
consumers ignore.

# ── Built-in Denied-Command Rules ──
# The canonical catalog of built-in denied commands.  Each rule is a Python
# REGEX (matched case-insensitively via ``re.search``) with a stable ``id``
# (the opt-out key + SEL audit key), a ``category`` for UI grouping, and a
# human ``description``.  Rules are DEFAULT-ON but user-disableable from
# Settings → Security; a governance ``commands``-scope policy can force-pin a
# rule as un-opt-out-able (see ``platform/governance.py``).  Enforcement is at
# Kiro Crew's own ``hooks.py`` PreToolUse gate — these are NOT injected into the
# kiro-cli agent spec.
#
# The always-on keystone controls (``_is_git_publish``,
# ``is_sensitive_bash_command``, ``audit_bash_exfiltration``,
# ``_check_imds_access``, ``_ENV_CRED_PATTERNS``, ``_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS``) are
# independent and un-disableable; they run BEFORE the rule tiers.

# drift apart.
#
# The narrowing this rule carries over a plain substring match is entirely in its
# two anchors, because those are the two an attacker cannot rewrite around:
# * the dump verb must both BEGIN and END a word (``(?<![\w-])`` / ``(?!\w)``), so
#   ``unset``, ``offset``, ``pyenv``, ``dotenv``, ``virtualenv``,
#   ``src/environment`` and ``settings.py`` are not dumps. A ``.`` or ``/`` before
#   the verb is deliberately allowed: ``/usr/bin/env``, ``/bin/printenv`` and
#   ``/proc/self/environ`` are the same dumps under a path and are the most
#   ordinary spelling of the command. The filter word is bounded on its right the
#   same way, so a quoted filter (``env | 'grep' AWS_SECRET``) still counts while
#   ``grepfoo`` does not;
# * the selector must be a name whose selection can PRINT a credential
#   (``_AWS_VAR_SELECTOR``) -- ``env | grep AWS_REGION`` cannot, and is allowed.
# A ``|`` must appear between the dump and the filter, which is what keeps ``env``
# as a wrapper (``env FOO=1 cmd``), ``set -e; grep AWS_ file.txt`` and
# ``cat .env; grep AWS_ config.py`` out.
#
# The gaps are deliberately plain ``.*`` -- ordered existence within one LINE, with
# no attempt to confine the match to a single shell statement or pipeline stage.
# A statement-scoped span has to treat ``;`` and ``&`` as separators, and a regex
# cannot tell a separator from the identical character inside a quoted argument:
# ``env | sed 's/;/x/' | grep AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`` and
# ``env | grep -E 'a&b|AWS_SECRET'`` are ordinary credential dumps whose only
# unusual feature is a quoted separator, and a span that stops there fails OPEN.
# Guessing the other way costs an over-block instead: a ``set …`` earlier in the
# line makes any later ``… | grep AWS_`` in the same line a match. That is the
# residual, it is the safe direction, and it is the reason the gaps are not spans.
#
# What this rule does NOT cover, on purpose: a dump REDIRECTED to a file and read
# back with no pipe (``env > f; grep AWS_SECRET f``). Correlating the sink with the
# reader needs a backreference, which the RE2-style engine these built-ins are
# authored for does not have; and blocking only the ``grep`` spelling would be no
# control at all, since ``awk``, ``sed`` and a plain ``cat`` of the same file read

# ``AWS_CONFIG_FILE`` / ``AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`` hold a PATH, not a

# and every SDK read them directly.
#
# Two rules are deliberately ABSENT here, and the reasoning is worth keeping
# because it generalizes to any future "deny the variable name" proposal: a
# shell dereference (``$NAME``, ``${NAME}``, ``%NAME%``, ``!NAME!``,
# ``$env:NAME``) and an inline-interpreter environment lookup
# (``os.environ['NAME']``).
#
# Such a rule is only reachable at all when something EXPORTS one of these
# names into an agent child pinned at the real home, which would make the name
# an alias for a path the sensitive-path keystone fences; because the matchers
# here work on command TEXT with no variable expansion, that alias would be
# reachable while the literal path is refused.
#
# Closing that retrieval one spelling at a time -- the shell sigils, then the
# interpreter lookup, then ``cp "$(printenv NAME)" x`` -- is the shape of a
# losing race: command substitution, ``eval``, indirect expansion
# (``v=NAME; cat "${!v}"``), and a two-line helper script are all still
# available, and no text matcher can see through them. The alias is denied at
# its source instead: the remap in ``acp.client._apply_pod_home_remap`` exports
# neither name. With nothing manufacturing the alias, such rules would guard
# only an operator who set the variable in their own environment -- their own
# named file, not an alias this codebase created -- at the cost of implying a
# completeness the pattern class cannot deliver. Partial coverage of an
# unbounded bypass space is worse than none, because it reads as a fence.
#
# That judgement holds across this whole catalog, so this note reads as
# precedent rather than as an exception: the twenty-seven
# sensitive-file-read rows are absent for the identical reason, so no path --
# named literally or through a variable -- is fenced at the text layer. The
# floor is
# ``redact_credentials`` on the output, ``is_sensitive_path`` on every resolved
# path a file tool opens (which anchors ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME`` as an alternate home
# root, so a pod's relocated credential tree is covered there), and the OS sandbox
# on the subprocess. ``_AWS_SECRET_VAR_NAMES`` above still denies retrieval of the
# variables that hold a SECRET rather than a path; that set is closed and
# enumerable, which is why a name-based rule is defensible there and not here.


# ── The recursive-force ``rm`` deletion rules (root + home) ─────────────────
#
# Both rules block ``rm`` invoked with BOTH the recursive and the force flag
# against a catastrophic target (the filesystem root, or the user home): the
# flag spelling ``-fr``/``-rfv``, split ``-r -f``, the long options
# ``--recursive --force``/unambiguous prefixes, and ``--no-preserve-root``, and
# the home target spelled ``~`` / ``$HOME`` / ``${HOME}``.
#
# Their pattern string is the BASE LITERAL — ``rm -rf /.*`` / ``rm -rf ~.*`` —
# which STAYS LIVE in the Python ``re`` deny tier as a fail-closed net, UNIONed
# with the argv-structural floor ``rm_floor._recursive_force_rm_targets`` wired
# in ``security.is_denied``. The floor reads only the ``rm`` command's OWN argv
# (flags in any position, the home/root spellings, glob-over-children
# ``/*``/``~/*``, exec/command-string wrappers, ``sh -c`` payloads, xargs stdin)
# and adds the STRUCTURAL flag-spelling coverage the two issues ask for. The
# regex net catches a quoted payload the own-argv model cannot reach
# (``su -c "rm -rf /"``, ``eval``, ``trap``). The net's one false positive — a
# ``grep``-family search that merely NAMES the literal — is narrowed by the
# ``_DENY_EXCEPTIONS`` grep inert-search carve-out. The literal remains the
# pattern so the catalog row keeps a stable identity for the golden fixture, the
# opt-out surface, SEL audit, and a governance ceiling pin.

# All members stay in the regex tier (only git-publish is removed from ``re``);
# the floor is a union with it, never a replacement, and each predicate runs

# Why a floor denial happened, in words, for the rules whose floor can fire on

#
# The refusal's first line reports that pattern (see the floor branch in
# ``is_denied``) so the reason and the SEL event still map back to a rule id.
# That identifier is not an explanation, though, and for a floor hit it is a
# misleading one: ``python -c "import kiro_crew"`` is denied by the argv floor,
# while the pattern it names requires a ``token`` word the command does not
# contain. A reader who trusts the line looks for the wrong thing — and the
# refusal reason is now handed to the MODEL in-band on a tool deny
# (``chat_runner._steer_policy_notice``), so a wrong explanation actively
# misdirects the agent's next attempt rather than merely reading oddly in a log.
#
# Presentation only, on the refusal's SECOND line, which both consumers ignore:
# ``RecoveryCard.tsx`` extracts the pattern with a per-line end-anchored regex
# and the suite's ``_denied_by`` partitions on the first line's separator.
#
# The four ``_SELF_PROTECTION_UNGATED_FLOOR_IDS`` entries are the same shape, but
# for them the first line reports the ID itself (there is no catalog pattern to
# report), the way the gated git-publish floor does.  The opening phrase is the

#
# The rules below are the ``chmod``/``chown`` rows -- most naming a system
# path, one naming the world-writable mode.  They are authored as
# ``<verb>.*<target>.*`` and evaluated with ``re.search`` over
# the WHOLE command text, which cannot tell a verb in PROGRAM position from the
# same word handed to a search tool as a pattern.  So an ordinary audit of these
# very rules is refused:
#
#     git show origin/main:src/x.py | grep -nE 'chmod|chown|/etc/' | head -50
#     grep -rnE 'os\.chown|/etc/cron' src/ 2>/dev/null | head -60
#     grep -n 'chmod 777' src/kiro_crew/security/denied_rules.py
#
# Neither changes a permission.  Denying them prevents nothing (the same search
# completes by spelling the verb some other way) and surfaces to the agent as
# ``User denied tool execution``, indistinguishable from a human cancelling.
#
# A TEXT glob carve-out is the wrong instrument twice over: a glob cannot express
# "this word sits at an argument position", and gating it on "the view holds no
# shell-active character" would still miss both commands above (each carries
# ``|`` or ``>``).
#
# The narrowing therefore lives at the ARGV layer

# for the patterns named here, so no other rule's behaviour can change.
#
# Derived, never hand-listed: the catalog is the single source of truth for
# which rows exist, and a hand-maintained copy of those regex literals would
# silently stop covering a row that is renamed or added.  The selector is
# "``local-destructive`` row whose pattern BEGINS with a permission verb".
#
# It is deliberately blind to what the row matches AFTER the verb.  An earlier
# revision of this selector required a rooted path, which excluded the mode row
# and left an ordinary search for that very rule denied.  The mode row's own
# pattern is also under revision to admit flag spellings, so a selector keyed on

# ── ReDoS mitigation for the regex deny tier ──
# The 137 built-in rule patterns were authored for kiro-cli's linear-time
# (RE2-style) engine.  Under Python's backtracking ``re`` two independent
# pathologies appear on hostile input, so the raw patterns must never be fed to
# ``re.search`` verbatim.  ``_DenyMatcher`` compiles each pattern into a
# behaviourally-identical but linear-time matcher and matches against the FULL
# (untruncated) string, so a destructive needle at any offset is always found.
# All of this is EVALUATION-LAYER only — ``BUILTIN_DENIED_RULES`` (and the
# golden fixture the parity test pins to) stay byte-for-byte unchanged, and the
# human-readable denial reason / SEL audit still report the ORIGINAL pattern.
#
# Pathology 1 — catastrophic (exponential) backtracking.
#   The 46 ``aws-*`` patterns embed the nested-star flag run
#   ``(?:\s+--?[a-z-]+(?:[= ]\S+)?)*``.  Two internal ambiguities make it
#   exponential: (a) ``--?`` and ``[a-z-]+`` can both claim the leading dashes
#   of a flag; (b) a space-separated value ``[= ]\S+`` can equally be read as
#   the next flag.  On input like ``aws -x -x -x …`` (only ~40 repeats / ~124
#   chars) the engine explores 2ⁿ parses before failing — a length bound does
#   NOT help because the blow-up happens well below any sane bound.  We rewrite
#   the run to ``_LINEARIZED_AWS_FLAG_RUN`` which removes BOTH ambiguities
#   (``--?``→``-`` for the flag name, and a negative lookahead so a space value
#   cannot itself be a flag token).  This is provably language-equivalent — see
#   ``test_denied_commands_security`` ReDoS tests and the exhaustive
#   brute-force/directional equivalence checks documented there.
#
# Pathology 2 — polynomial (O(n²)/O(n³)) backtracking.
#   Every ``.*``-prefixed pattern (~50 of them) and the multi-``.*`` chains
#   (e.g. ``python.*open.*/\.ssh/``) are linear/polynomial per pattern but scan
#   the whole string, so across ~123 effective patterns a 20k-char input costs
#   seconds.  These ``.*`` occur ONLY at the TOP LEVEL of the ported patterns
#   (none has a top-level alternation or a top-level ``.+``), so we SPLIT each
#   pattern on its top-level ``.*`` into fixed fragments and existence-match
#   them in order with a monotonically-advancing ``re.search(text, pos)``.  A
#   top-level ``.*`` matches "anything", so "fragment₀ then fragment₁ then …"
#   at leftmost advancing positions is exactly equivalent to the whole regex —
#   verified by exhaustive brute-force + a 40k-input equivalence harness — but
#   runs in O(n) with NO backtracking across the gaps and NO length bound, so a
#   padded needle inside a single un-separated segment (the bypass this fixes)
#   is still caught.  A pattern that is NOT safe to split this way (a top-level
#   alternation, only possible via a user-supplied custom regex — no built-in
#   has one) falls back to a length-bounded ``re.search`` on the linearized
#   form (``_DENY_FALLBACK_SCAN_MAX_CHARS``): correct for short commands and
#   ReDoS-safe, at the cost of not scanning a needle past the bound in such an
#   exotic custom pattern (built-ins are unaffected).

# ── ReDoS-safety gate for USER-supplied deny regexes ──
# The 137 built-in patterns are ReDoS-safe by construction (the one dangerous
# construct — the aws flag run — is rewritten by ``_linearize_deny_pattern``,
# and the git-publish patterns never reach the regex tier).  But a USER can add
# an ARBITRARY regex via ``POST /api/security/denied-commands/user``; a
# catastrophic-backtracking pattern such as ``(a+)+$`` would then run inside the
# synchronous PreToolUse gate on the event loop and could freeze the gateway
# (2ⁿ backtracking is NOT bounded by scanning a length-limited prefix — the
# blow-up happens far below any byte bound).  ``is_safe_user_regex`` is a
# conservative, stdlib-only STRUCTURAL check used both at the add boundary
# (reject with HTTP 400) and as runtime defense-in-depth in ``_DenyMatcher``
# (an already-stored unsafe pattern is skipped, never executed).
#
# Heuristic (the classic exponential family): a pattern is UNSAFE if it contains
# a QUANTIFIED GROUP — one whose quantifier permits >1 repetitions (``*``,
# ``+``, ``{m,}``, ``{m,n}`` with n>1, ``{n}`` with n>1) — whose body itself
# contains EITHER (a) another quantifier (nested quantifier: ``(X+)+``,
# ``(X*)*``, ``(X?)*`` …) OR (b) a top-level alternation (branch-overlap risk:
# ``(a|a)+``, ``(ab|a)+``).  We deliberately err toward REJECTING a suspicious
# user pattern: built-ins are unaffected (they are added programmatically, never
# through this gate), and a user who hits a false positive can rephrase without
# the nested quantifier.  We first strip the known-safe linearized aws flag run
# so the (harmless) built-in construct is never mistaken for the dangerous
# signature if this ever runs over the effective set.

    That family is harmless on a length-capped window and NOT harmless without

    * Bounded path (USER CUSTOM REGEXES + any built-in with a top-level

    (``re.error``) is likewise disabled so one bad rule cannot wedge the gate.

    on ``_DenyMatcher``).  The matcher scans the FULL string, so a destructive
    needle at any offset (e.g. after a long benign prefix inside one un-split
    shell segment) is found — no length truncation.  A malformed stored pattern
    (``re.error``) is treated as a non-match so a single bad custom rule cannot

    The first line is byte-for-byte what it has always been. That is load bearing,
    not stylistic: ``RecoveryCard.tsx`` extracts the pattern with
    ``/Blocked by security policy:\\s*(.+?)\\s*$/gm`` -- per-line and end-anchored --
    so anything appended to the SAME line is captured as part of the pattern, and
    ``_denied_by`` in the test suite partitions on the exact
    ``"Blocked by security policy: "`` separator.  A note therefore goes on its own
    line, where both readers ignore it.

    Built-in rules never carry a note (the map holds user patterns only), so for them
    this returns exactly the historical string -- unless the caller passes
    *note_override*, which the argv-structural floor uses to say why a pattern the
    input does not literally match was still the rule that fired.  Without it the
    reported pattern is the rule's catalog regex, which for that path provably
    cannot match the input, so the reason names a cause the reader can disprove.

    *diagnostic* appends a THIRD line naming the rule id, the deciding component and
    the matched span's offsets and character-class shape (see
    :mod:`kiro_crew.security.diagnostics`).  It is opt-in per call site rather than
    always-on, and the split is not cosmetic: a pattern-tier denial's first line
    already IS the accurate cause, so a diagnostic there would add a line to every
    ordinary refusal for no information, while a STRUCTURAL denial reports a pattern
    the input cannot match and is the case an agent cannot diagnose at all.  So the
    tiers that decide on argv shape pass one and the pattern tiers do not, which is
    also why a plain catalog refusal stays exactly one line.

    Module-level rather than a closure because EVERY tier that can refuse must emit
    the identical micro-format: a second producer would be free to drift from the
    three consumers that parse it.
