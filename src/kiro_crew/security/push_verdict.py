"""Gateway-owned push verdicts: evidence the push guard ran, held where the agent cannot reach it.

WHAT THIS IS
------------
The prepare-pr skill's pre-push stale-base guard answers one question -- is this branch
being published on a base that has moved -- and a verdict that is only printed persists
nothing, so a publish whose gate was skipped is byte-identical to one whose gate passed.

The evidence lives HERE, in the gateway process, and nothing outside this process writes
it. The agent asks the gateway to run the guard; the gateway runs it, records what IT
observed, and the ``git push`` allow path in the shell-command floor reads that record.

WHY THE GATEWAY IS THE WRITER
-----------------------------
Any store the agent can write is evidence the gated party controls, and signing does not
help when the key is as readable as the file. So the writer is the one party the agent
cannot impersonate: the gateway itself. ``record`` is called from the gateway's own route
handler, which runs in this process; the MCP tool the agent calls is a separate process
that reaches that route over loopback and carries a request, never a result.

WHY THE GATE TOUCHES NO FILESYSTEM
----------------------------------
The publish floor runs inside the permission gate, where a slow mount is a stall of every
task in the process. So the floor reads only this module's in-process activation reading and
nothing else: no receipt file, no policy file, no ref read, no subprocess, no network.

That is affordable because on an activated install the agent never holds publish authority
at all: the gateway judges the commit and does the push itself, so an agent-visible ``git
push`` has no legitimate reason to run and the floor refuses every one of them outright. The
floor needs no receipt to match and no tree-binding to resolve -- one flat refusal under
activation removes the authority this gate exists to remove.

WHAT A VERDICT IS KEYED ON
--------------------------
The CALLING SESSION, never a worktree named in a request body -- the contract
``dashboard/handlers/session_ledger.py`` states for its own routes. A session cannot ask
for a verdict about one worktree and then publish from another, because it never names the
worktree: its own identity selects the record. There is no enrolled list, so there is also
no over-refusal of a repository nobody asked about.

ACTIVATION IS THE OPERATOR'S, AND IT IS TRUSTED
-----------------------------------------------
``activation_enabled`` reads a leaf on the protected keystone -- the one placement where the
agent's file tools can neither read nor write it (it is write-protected and file-tool
unreadable; the read-only sandbox mount still lets a shell read the bytes), the same floor the
computer-use primary enable sits on
and for the same reason. ``config.json`` may REQUEST activation; only the keystone
AUTHORIZES it, so an agent with file-write access cannot enable or disable this gate. It is
off until an operator turns it on out of band, so an installation that never activates it
is judged exactly as it is on main.

Once activated, the check runs in the UNCONDITIONAL git-publish path rather than behind the
opt-out tiers, because an opt-out key would hand the gated party its own bypass.

Activation is on disk and survives a restart. Verdicts are the opposite, in-process only: a
restart costs one guard re-run rather than leaving a stale pass behind.

A git ``pre-push`` hook is deliberately NOT the mechanism: the gateway pins
``core.hooksPath=/dev/null`` so a repository-planted hook cannot execute host-side.

#: state being judged and fail outright once that tree is read-only.
#:
#: It gets the SAME protection as ``ACTIVATION_LEAF`` and for a sharper reason: a mirror the

#: writes it directly, not through the sandbox, exactly as the settings PUT writes the

#:
#: Being a DIRECTORY it takes the directory dispositions, which is not a detail: a fence seals
#: an EXISTING path only, and on a fresh activated install no judgement has run yet, so the
#: mirror root is absent, the read-only mount is skipped, and the name the agent would create
#: is exactly the one the listing exists to deny. ``sandbox._CREW_PRECREATE_READONLY_DIR_LEAVES``
#: materialises it before any sandbox starts and ``_CREW_NOFOLLOW_READONLY_DIR_LEAVES`` keeps its
#: name unreplaceable. It is deliberately absent from the FILE precreate list, which would
#: materialise an empty file at the mirror root's own path and make the first ``mkdir`` raise.

    Three facts, and they are pinned in the SAME operator-written file on purpose. The digest
    is what anchors the guard's bytes outside the repository: an installation tree can be the

    a value an operator wrote where the agent cannot write can.

    ``pinned_push_url`` anchors the DESTINATION the same way the digest anchors the guard's
    bytes. The push destination is resolved from the agent-writable worktree git config, so an
    ordinary ``git remote set-url`` performed before the request points the credential-exempt
    gateway publish at an attacker-chosen same-history repository -- and the re-resolution at
    publish time only compares the freshly-resolved target to itself, catching a change AFTER
    judging rather than an agent-chosen destination that was already in place. The one value
    the agent cannot write is one an operator pinned here, so a pinned destination is the
    binding that closes "agent picks the destination": empty when the operator pinned none,
    in which case the destination is unconstrained exactly as it is on an install that never

    Re-read per call, with no cache, which is a DELIBERATE choice pinned by

    cannot tell two writes of the same byte length within one clock tick apart, and the value
    it would serve is an ENABLE decision, so the failure mode is the gate reading as off after
    an operator turned it on. The cost -- one ``open`` + JSON parse of a tiny leaf -- is paid to
    keep that correctness, and the one caller on the event loop (``hooks.on_tool_call``) reaches
    it only on an installation whose operator ACTIVATED gating.

    On disk rather than in memory, so activation SURVIVES A RESTART: a gateway that comes
    back up is still gating, and an operator does not silently lose a control they turned
    on. The verdicts themselves are deliberately the opposite -- in-process only, so a
    restart costs one guard re-run and never leaves a stale pass behind.

    Read by opening the keystone path directly in the gateway, which is the keystone-reader
    pattern the other protected leaves use. ``config.json`` is not consulted here at all:
    an operator may REQUEST activation from config, but only the keystone AUTHORIZES it, and
    the same split applies to the digest -- a digest offered in config is not read, so an
    agent that writes config can neither turn this gate on nor change which guard bytes it
    will accept.

    the honest answer for an installation nobody activated: off, with no digest. A leaf that

    would be a fail-OPEN -- corrupting this one file would silently disable the gate
    on an installation whose operator had turned it on. Returning off is only safe for
