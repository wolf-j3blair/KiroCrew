"""The inert-MENTION narrowing for the permission-verb deny rows.

One question, asked of one derived set of catalog rows: is every occurrence of a
permission verb in this command an ARGUMENT of a command that treats arguments as
data? The catalog's path-scoped ``chmod``/``chown`` rows are ``re.search``
patterns over the whole command text, so they cannot tell a verb that RUNS from
the same word handed to a search tool as a pattern -- which is why an ordinary
audit of those very rules is refused. :func:`_perm_verb_mention_only` supplies
the missing question, and ``is_denied`` consults it for that derived set and
nothing else (see ``denied_rules._PERM_VERB_MENTION_PATTERNS``).

It reuses the primitives the argv floor already relies on rather than adding a
parser: ``_shell_payload_sources`` for the frame walk (which descends ``bash
-c``, ``eval``, heredocs and command/process substitution to any depth),
``_argv_programs`` for "which command is this token an argument of", and
``_data_consumer_exempt`` for the per-token data judgement.

Every gate here is a REFUSAL, so the predicate fails closed: a construct it
cannot read keeps the deny. It lives in its own module rather than inside
``argv_floor`` because it is the one family there that narrows a catalog row
instead of adding a floor, and because that file is held to a per-module line
ceiling by ``test_no_single_module_grows_back_into_a_monolith``.

#
# Every gate below is a REFUSAL, so the predicate fails closed: a construct it
# cannot read keeps the deny.  The ones that were reachable bypasses while this
# was being written, each now closed:
#
#   * ``X=1 chmod 777 /etc/shadow`` -- ``_argv_programs`` skips the leading
#     assignment, so the verb becomes its own command's PROGRAM and
#     ``_data_consumer_exempt`` then reads ``programs[i] == "chmod"``, which IS
#     in ``_DATA_CONSUMER_PROGRAMS`` (it is listed there as a filesystem mover
#     whose own arguments are paths).  ``_PERM_VERB_MENTION_PROGRAMS`` removes
#     the permission verbs from the accepted set, so the verb can never
#     exonerate itself.
#   * ``echo 'chmod 777 /etc/x' > /tmp/s.sh`` -- ``echo``/``printf`` emit their
#     argument AS the file's content, and ``>`` is not a command separator, so
#     exonerating them would exonerate writing the command to a script.  This is
#     the same case the rm inert-search carve-out (``_DENY_EXCEPTIONS``) declines
#     to open; the emitters and
#     the filesystem mutators are both removed from the accepted set, and any
#     redirect other than to ``/dev/null`` refuses outright.
#   * ``grep -h 'chmod 777 /etc/x' f | python`` -- a downstream stage can EXECUTE
#     what the search emitted.  ``_pipes_into_evaluator`` covers the shells;
#     the downstream-program gate below covers the rest by requiring every
#     program AFTER the mention to be an accepted data consumer too.
#   * ``echo "$(bash -c 'chmod 777 /etc/x')"`` -- frame 0 reads as pure data
#     (``echo``'s argument opens with a quote, not with the substitution), so the
#     mention is only caught in the NESTED frame.  That is why the walk must be
#     over every frame and why one bad frame refuses the whole exemption.
#
# Quoting is load-bearing in one place.  ``grep -nE 'chmod|chown|/etc/'`` hands
# ``shlex`` a token carrying ``|``, which ``_data_consumer_exempt`` reads as a
# control operator introducing a new program -- correct for a BARE
# ``grep -nE chmod|chown /etc/passwd``, where bash really does run
# ``chown /etc/passwd``.  The two are indistinguishable after POSIX quote
# removal, so this walk tokenizes in NON-POSIX mode (quotes retained) and masks
# operators only inside a token that is provably one SINGLE-quoted literal.
# Single quotes are absolute in POSIX shell -- no substitution, no escape, no
# operator -- so the mask states a fact about the shell rather than trusting the
# spelling.  A double-quoted token gets no mask: ``"x|$(chmod 777 /etc/y)"``
# still expands, and the mask would hide the ``|`` while the substitution ran.
# The mask is also kept OUT of the command-level disqualification, which is
# computed on the unmasked argv: ``awk '{print | "sh"}'`` must stay
# disqualified, and that reading depends on the ``|`` the mask would remove.

    never the problem.

    Asked on the MASKED argv, so an operator proven to sit inside a quoted literal
    has already been neutralized and a quoted alternation keeps its exemption.

    A REDIRECTION spelling of ``&`` is stripped before the question is asked.
    ``2>&1``, ``>&2`` and ``&>/dev/null`` duplicate a file descriptor; none of them
    starts a command, which is why ``_ends_argv`` declines to cut there.  Stripping
    only these fixed shapes keeps the refusal on every ``&`` that is not one of
