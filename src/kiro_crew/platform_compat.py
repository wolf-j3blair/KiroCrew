    Lives beside the two ``reexec_*`` functions because it is their partner: it
    answers the one outcome neither of them can, and a future reader editing
    either exec sees it here.

    Both update-restart paths reach their exec only after ``close_all()``, which
    makes the exec the last reversible instruction they have. Every session is
    already torn down, the final history save already ran, and the tree on disk
    is already the NEW version while this process image is still the old one.

    Callers validate the target BEFORE the drain, and that is what keeps the
    ordinary failures out of here -- but validating cannot make an exec
    infallible. The target can be replaced between the check and the call, and a
    file that is present and carries the exec bit can still be the wrong
    architecture, a truncated image, or a script whose interpreter is missing.
    The kernel is the authority on every one of those and reports them as
    ``OSError`` from ``execv`` itself, so the exec site is the only place they
    can be answered -- and answering them by returning is what left a gateway
    alive with nothing to serve.

    Answer by exiting. A surviving process here serves nothing it can serve
    honestly: its sessions are gone, and its code and the install on disk are
    different versions.
    It also holds the port, so the operator's own relaunch would fail to bind on
    top of it. Exiting makes the failure visible to whatever started this
    gateway, frees the port for that relaunch, and cannot serve the version skew.
    Reopening admission instead would not substitute: the sessions closed by
    ``close_all()`` do not come back, and the skew would then be served.

    Exits through ``os._exit``, which runs no ``atexit`` handler -- so the two
    bounded flushes the force-exit signal handler performs are repeated here for
    the same reason: the CRITICAL line is the whole diagnosis, and it is queued,
    not yet on disk. Both are best-effort; a wedged disk must delay this exit,
    never hold it. Unlike that signal handler, which cannot await, both run on a
    worker thread: waiting for a wedged log write on the event loop would hold every
    remaining task -- and the port this exit exists to release -- for the length of
    their own timeouts.

    Off-loop alone does not make the wait bounded, so the event log's flush also
    carries a deadline and runs on the dedicated subprocess pool rather than the
    default executor. ``asyncio.to_thread`` queues against a pool every other
    ``to_thread`` in the process shares: saturated, the await never resumes and the
    exit this function exists to perform simply never happens -- the loop is free,
    which is what the inner ceiling guarantees, but the process still serves nothing
    on a port it never releases. A deadline around the flush, plus a pool kept
    separate for calls that can block on a wedged kernel resource, is what makes "a
    wedged disk must delay this exit, never hold it" true of the wait and not only of
    the work.

    The ``gateway.log`` tail is not spelled out again here.
    :func:`kiro_crew.cli.drain_log_queue_before_hard_exit` is the shared async

# ── macOS TCC-protected home subdirectories ──
# macOS gates these home subdirectories behind TCC (Transparency, Consent and
# Control). The FIRST read of any one of them by a given app triggers a modal
# "…would like to access files in your Downloads folder" prompt, and consent is
# recorded PER (app, folder) pair — so incidentally touching three of them
# during one operation produces THREE separate prompts, not one.
#
# Nothing KiroCrew does at startup needs these folders: they are only ever
# reached INCIDENTALLY, by a breadth-first walk that was rooted at $HOME as a
# catch-all fallback (the @-mention file picker's search root). Pruning them
# from such unscoped walks removes the prompts entirely, which is strictly
# better than pre-declaring NS*FolderUsageDescription strings — those change
# the prompt's wording but still prompt, once per folder.
#
# This does NOT restrict a user's EXPLICIT navigation: an operation whose root
# the user named (a project dir, or a browse request for ~/Downloads itself) is
# scoped by definition and never consults this set. macOS still shows its own
# one-time prompt for that deliberate access, which is the expected contract.
#
# Names only (no leading path): matched against a single path component so the
# same set works for both os.walk dirname pruning and scandir entry filtering.

    express — a POSIX ACL's named-user entry (``user:me:w``) does not appear in

    evaluates the full ACL, which is why :data:`_ACCESS_HONOURS_EFFECTIVE_IDS`
    gates that arm rather than a bare ``os.access``: without ``faccessat`` the

    The ACL arm cannot run as root, and that is why running as root DECLINES rather

      ``/usr/local/bin/aws -> /tmp/link -> /usr/bin/aws`` yields ``/usr/bin`` and
      its ancestors with ``/tmp`` — the one directory where the retarget
      happens — never named;
    * walking ``os.path.dirname`` / ``Path.parents`` lexically misses a symlinked
      COMPONENT, because ``os.stat`` follows symlinks while ``dirname`` does not:
      for ``/usr/local/bin -> /opt/x/bin`` the target's own parent ``/opt/x``,
      which can replace it wholesale, is never visited.

    Every lexical ancestor of the fully resolved target is in the result (the
    walk builds the target's path one directory at a time, and each directory is
    recorded before a name is joined onto it), so a question asked over this list
    is asked over a superset of ``resolved.parents`` plus the target. Symlinks
    met on the way are deliberately absent: their mode is meaningless (0777 on
    Linux) and they cannot be edited in place, only replaced, which the directory
    holding them — present in the result — already governs.

    POSIX path semantics (``os.sep``-rooted); Windows callers keep their own
    ACL-driven chains and must not route through here.

    ``None`` on any ``OSError`` and on any path needing more than
    :data:`_MAX_SYMLINK_HOPS` expansions. The fail direction is "could not
    enumerate", never a shorter list: a caller that treats ``None`` as anything
    but a refusal is answering a question it did not ask.

    bare pid, and Windows keeps that number after the parent dies. When the dead
    parent's pid is later recycled, an unrelated process appears as a child of the
    recycler -- and, being unrelated, is often one this user cannot terminate, so
    ending it fails and a caller that treats the set as a tree draws the wrong
    conclusion in whichever direction hurts it (killing a stranger, or calling a
    foreign listener its own).

    A genuine child was created after its parent, while such a stray was created
    while the pid still belonged to the process it was born under, so comparing the
    creation identities separates the two exactly. Both tokens are the creation
    ``FILETIME`` as decimal text (:func:`process_start_time`); a token that is not
    (nothing on Windows produces one) is not attributable, and the caller must leave
    that process alone rather than act on a guess.

    Lives HERE, beside the primitive whose staleness it compensates for, because
    three callers need the same Boolean rule: the pod backend's ``stop``,
    ``pod.runtime.port_owner``, and the test harness's Windows teardown. This thin
    wrapper validates their numeric FILETIME domain, then delegates ordering to
    the shared tri-state core so no second comparison implementation can drift.
    All three reach it through

    :func:`process_start_time` pin recorded when the child was spawned: argv
    equality alone cannot rule out a recycled pid running an identical
    command line, and on macOS the comparison basis below makes equality
    necessary but not sufficient for vector equality. The pair fails toward
    "do not signal" on either mismatch.

    Linux: ``/proc/<pid>/cmdline`` NUL-split and compared element-wise (an
    empty cmdline — a zombie — never matches). macOS: ``ps -ww -o command=``
    reports the argv space-joined, so the comparison is against
    ``" ".join(expected_argv)``; exact only when no expected element contains
    a space, which holds for the argv shapes this guards (option tokens and
    validated host/target strings). Windows: always False — the raw
    ``Win32_Process.CommandLine`` string (see :func:`process_command_line`)
    carries shell quoting rather than an argv vector, so element-exact
    equality is not verifiable there; the guard fails closed and callers must
    not signal.

    satisfies both :func:`pid_exists` and :func:`pid_liveness` while naming no

    process is still alive" from "that number now belongs to some unrelated
    process's thread", which matters once the pid counter wraps
    (``/proc/sys/kernel/pid_max`` is commonly 4194304 and a busy host cycles it

    ONLY thread-group leaders. A non-leader tid is absent from that listing
    even though ``/proc/<tid>`` stays directly openable — which is exactly why
    the cheaper per-pid probes cannot see the difference.

    Deliberately ONE directory read for the whole host rather than a read per

    shutdown cancels the owning task, and without this the child keeps
    running after the process that started it is gone.

    The whole TREE is signalled, not just the direct child. A spawned command
    is often a shell line (``curl … | sh``, ``pip … | tee log``), so killing

    screen and the act that follows it must reach the same object, and the two
    platforms reach that property by OPPOSITE routes:

    * POSIX: every call is ``dir_fd=``-relative, so the descriptor IS the
      directory whatever its name now resolves to. It must be that way, because
      the pin does NOT stop a rename here -- a name re-resolved after the screen
      is exactly the hole.
    * Windows: there are no ``dir_fd`` operations at all (``os.open``,
      ``os.listdir``, ``os.unlink`` and ``os.rmdir`` are in neither
      ``os.supports_fd`` nor ``os.supports_dir_fd``), so every call goes by path
      -- and that is sound only because the pin makes the path stable: the handle
      is opened without ``FILE_SHARE_DELETE``, so while it lives this directory
      and every ancestor refuse a rename and a delete.

    So neither route works on the other platform, and a caller written in terms of
    one of them is broken on the other. That asymmetry is the whole reason this
    exists rather than each site branching on ``IS_POSIX`` itself.

    A child is opened THROUGH the parent, and the parent stays pinned while the
    child is in use, so a chain of these pins the whole path. :meth:`child`
    refuses a link at the name on both platforms, which is what makes a
    screen-then-descend sequence safe: the refusal happens in the open, not in a
    check before it.

    Use it as a context manager; the descriptor is closed on exit. Removing the
    directory ITSELF is the parent's job (``parent.rmdir(name)``), both because a
    pinned directory on Windows cannot be removed while the handle lives and
    because a by-name removal is the thing this class exists to avoid.

    A chain is bounded: :meth:`child` refuses past ``PINNED_TREE_MAX_DEPTH`` levels

    Shared by :func:`pin_directory`, :func:`open_file_no_reparse` and
    :func:`open_entry_no_follow` so they do not carry separate copies of the same
    security-critical flags. What each of them then asserts about the descriptor
    differs; how the object is reached must not.

    *desired_access* is a parameter because callers need different access, not because
    it is inert. A caller that reads BYTES needs ``GENERIC_READ``, the default; a caller
    that walks a path asks for :data:`_WIN_FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES`, attribute-only access
    that opens any reachable component (even a directory whose ACL grants traverse but
    not list) without consulting its share state, which ``GENERIC_READ`` cannot do.
    It also decides whether the share mode below means anything: Windows arbitrates
    sharing only for a request naming one of ``FILE_READ_DATA``, ``FILE_EXECUTE``,
    ``FILE_WRITE_DATA``, ``FILE_APPEND_DATA`` or ``DELETE``, so a mask naming none of
    them yields a handle that neither conflicts with another opener's share mode nor
    imposes its own. The two masks used here differ on exactly this: ``GENERIC_READ``
    (``pin_directory``/``open_file_no_reparse``) names a data right, so the omitted
    ``FILE_SHARE_DELETE`` bites and the held object cannot be renamed or deleted;
    ``_WIN_FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES`` (``open_entry_no_follow``, the path walk) names NONE,
    so its handle pins nothing -- it classifies a component off its own descriptor
    without freezing it. The walk does not rely on a pin: it resolves the proven path
    THROUGH the held descriptor (``fd_real_path``), so a leaf swapped after the walk
    does not redirect the answer. The one window that leaves open is a swap of an
    INTERIOR ancestor DURING the walk -- the walk opens each component by full path, so
    a junction planted on an already-classified ancestor is followed by the next open.
    That mid-walk ancestor swap stays an acknowledged open residual on Windows (closing
    it needs handle-relative opens, a separate change); it is named here and in the PR
    description rather than policed.

    The share mode is fixed at read+write sharing (:data:`_WIN_FILE_SHARE_READ_WRITE`)
    for every caller: a validator reaches ancestors every other process writes beneath,
    so a handle denying ``FILE_SHARE_WRITE`` would fail those processes' ``os.replace``
    into a held directory with a sharing violation for as long as the handle lived.

    ``OPEN_REPARSE_POINT`` is the whole point: a junction or symlink at the name is
    opened AS ITSELF, so the caller sees what is really there and the target is
    never touched. That is what makes the refusal atomic rather than a check
    followed by an open -- and on Windows the difference is not academic, because
    resolving a reparse point aimed at a UNC share is itself an outbound SMB
    authentication. ``BACKUP_SEMANTICS`` is what allows a directory to be opened at
    all and is harmless on a file. The share mode omits ``FILE_SHARE_DELETE``: for a
    data-right mask (``GENERIC_READ``) that bites, so while the descriptor lives the
    object cannot be renamed or deleted -- and for a directory, neither can anything
    above it; for the attribute-only mask it names nothing to arbitrate, so it neither
    pins nor conflicts (see the access-mask note above).

    The handle is wrapped in a CRT descriptor so ``os.fstat`` can read the
    attributes of what was actually opened and ``os.close`` can release it.

    ``O_BINARY`` is part of that wrapping, not a detail. A CRT descriptor in TEXT
    mode translates CRLF and stops at the first ``0x1A``, and a caller reading
    with a raw ``os.read`` gets that translation: on a body of 55 bytes holding
    one ``0x1A``, such a descriptor yields 12. ``os.fdopen(fd, "rb")`` hides the
    difference because ``io.FileIO`` sets the mode itself, so only a raw-read
    caller is exposed -- which is precisely the caller that copies media files.
    Naming the flag here makes the descriptor's contract the same for both.

    Those two assert what they opened and refuse anything else, which is right for a

    know, and needs the three answers kept apart. ``NotADirectoryError`` for a
    reparse point and for a plain file are the same exception from
    :func:`pin_directory`, so a walk built on it cannot tell "a link is sitting
    here, read its target" from "this component is an ordinary file, the path ends".

    The descriptor is the answer: read ``st_file_attributes`` off ``os.fstat`` on
    Windows, or ``os.fstat`` alone on POSIX, and the caller learns what is there
    from the object it is already holding rather than from a second look by name.

    Never follows. On Windows that is ``OPEN_REPARSE_POINT``, so a junction aimed at
    a share is opened as the junction and the share is not contacted; on POSIX it is
    ``O_NOFOLLOW``, which refuses a symlink at the name with ``ELOOP`` instead --
    the two platforms report a link differently and a caller has to handle both.

    ``O_NONBLOCK`` on POSIX so a FIFO at the name cannot make the open wait for a
    writer. Release the descriptor with ``os.close``.

    On Windows the access mask is :data:`_WIN_FILE_READ_ATTRIBUTES` -- attribute access
    only, never a TRAVERSE (data) right. Asking for TRAVERSE would make Windows check
    the request against each component's ACL, and a folder that grants no traverse yet
    is reachable through the bypass-traverse privilege (the ordinary case) would be
    refused -- so a validator sitting on session start could lose MCP settings on a
    component a normal walk passes. Attribute-only access is granted without Windows
    consulting the object's share state, so it never fails on such a folder: the walk
    classifies each component (its link-ness is read off the descriptor) without
    claiming to PIN it. The walk does not need a pin: the caller resolves the proven
    path THROUGH the deepest held descriptor (:func:`kiro_crew.pinned_fs.fd_real_path`),
    whose final path names the inode already open, so a junction swapped onto a proven
    LEAF after the walk cannot redirect the answer -- there is no second by-name lookup
    for it to catch.

    One window stays open and is named rather than policed: because each component is
    opened BY FULL PATH (Windows has no ``openat``), a junction swapped onto an already
    classified INTERIOR ancestor DURING the walk is followed by the next component's
    open. Closing that needs opening each child relative to its parent's handle
    (``NtCreateFile`` with ``RootDirectory``), a separate change; it is an acknowledged
    open residual on Windows, stated here and in the PR description.

    The share mode is :data:`_WIN_FILE_SHARE_READ_WRITE` -- write sharing stays OPEN, so
    an ordinary concurrent ``os.replace``/rename beneath a validated path is never
    refused while a validation runs; attribute-only access takes no part in sharing, so
    narrowing the share mode would change nothing here.

    The orphan-lock sweep removes a lock file only while holding its own
    exclusive lock on it: the held lock is the proof no launcher owns the inode,
    so a launcher that still holds (or re-takes) it is left alone, and the unlink
    happens WITHOUT first releasing — releasing before the unlink reopens the
    very race the proof closes (another launcher could lock a fresh inode at the
    same name in the gap).

    * POSIX: ``os.open(O_RDWR | O_NOFOLLOW)``. ``unlink`` of a file with open
      descriptors is routine; the inode lives until the last fd closes, and the
      held ``flock`` keeps a contender out meanwhile. This is exactly the open
      the sweep was doing, named.
    * Windows: ``os.open`` routes through the CRT, which opens with
      ``FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE`` and **omits** ``FILE_SHARE_DELETE``
      — so while that descriptor lives, ``os.unlink`` of the same name fails with
      a sharing violation (``PermissionError``/``WinError 32``). The sweep then
      declines to remove genuine residue, because its own verification handle is
      what blocks the delete. ``CreateFileW`` with
      ``FILE_SHARE_READ_WRITE_DELETE`` lets the delete land while this handle is
      still open (and still holding the ``msvcrt`` byte-range lock), preserving
      the hold-across-unlink guarantee on both platforms. ``OPEN_EXISTING``
      never creates — the sweep only ever removes names already present. No
      ``OPEN_REPARSE_POINT``: the sweep's caller has already refused a reparse
      point at the name (``is_link_or_junction``) and re-checks identity under
      the lock, and following here would still only reach a file this same user
      owns.

# ceiling would let a fix to either policy reach only one surface.
# :func:`proc_subtree_sample` is the
# single entry point for BOTH, and the helpers below are the per-process reads it
# is built from -- module-private, except :func:`read_proc_stat`, the stat
# reader for callers elsewhere. Pure stdlib: on a host without ``/proc`` every
# access raises ``OSError`` and each reading degrades to its own sentinel.
#
# NOT the only way this repository walks a process tree, and deliberately so.
# ``session_pid._build_child_map`` sums a session's tree from a full ``/proc``
# scan of every process's ``stat`` ``PPid`` field, precisely because the
# ``children`` file this walk reads needs ``CONFIG_PROC_CHILDREN`` and is
# documented as reliable only for frozen tasks -- for a live task it can return
# an incomplete child set and silently drop a descendant subtree from the sum.
# That trade is the right one there (an under-counted tree would make the RSS
# watchdog no-op) and the wrong one here: these two callers sample per backend
# and per live agent on a timer, where a whole-machine scan per sample is the
# larger cost, and an under-count degrades a displayed number rather than
# disabling a protection. Reconsidering the method for these two surfaces is a
# behaviour change to figures users already read, not part of this
# consolidation -- but it is now ONE place to reconsider instead of two.

#: Upper bound on processes walked in one subtree sample. A real tree is tiny
#: (a launcher plus a handful of workers); the cap only guards against a
#: pathological or looping ``/proc`` graph.
#:
#: It bounds THIS WALK's work; it is not a display ceiling for a count, and a
#: surface that already enumerates its own tree does not adopt it. Truncating a
#: displayed count at this number would hand the card a plain integer no
#: consumer can tell from a complete one, where ``procs``/``matched`` reserve
#: ``None`` for "unmeasurable". A walk that needs bounding elsewhere wants a

    process visited, so a runtime carrying twenty threads is twenty reads and a
    sampler walking forty roots pays that on each of them. A parent map is one
    read per process on the host and answers every root from memory. Measured on

    11296 children reads taking 432ms against 1717 ``stat`` reads taking 70ms,
    both routes returning the same 40 trees.

    The two routes agree for a process whose parent is alive, by construction:
    ``task/<tid>/children`` is the kernel's child list and ``stat``'s ppid is its
    inverse. Where they part, this map is the more complete of the two -- the
    child list is documented as reliable only for a frozen task, so a live tree
    can come back short through it. A process reparented after its parent died is
    outside both: its ppid becomes 1 and no surviving parent lists it.

    ``None`` -- off Linux, and when ``/proc`` cannot be listed -- means "walk the

    as every tree being the root alone.

    measured reason each:

    * :func:`_posix_process_parent_map` spawns ``ps -Ao pid=,ppid=``. Its edges
      agree with this map exactly (measured on a 1743-process host: 335 parents
      in both, zero whose child sets differ), but it costs 122-129ms against
      66-86ms for this pass, and it puts a subprocess spawn on a 5-second
      browser poll. ``_get_rss_tree_mb``'s own note records the same choice for
      the same reason: the Linux branch reads ``/proc`` directly and never

      whose ``comm`` is not valid UTF-8 -- any process may set its own name to

    A tracked process is frequently a thin launcher whose real memory lives in a
    child, so every reading describes the whole subtree rather than the root pid
    alone.

    The point of one pass is not only the fewer ``/proc`` reads: separate readers
    run at separate instants, so a process that exits between them is counted by
    one and missed by another. Reading every metric off a single frontier is what
    makes "the same set of processes" true of the *result* and not merely of the
    walk rules.

    ``rss`` / ``jiffies`` / ``counts`` let a caller skip the per-process reads it
    does not want, so sharing this walk costs each caller what its own walk cost:
    a CPU-only caller pays no ``status`` read, and an RSS-only caller pays no
    ``stat`` read. A skipped reading comes back as its own sentinel. When nothing
    remains to accumulate — RSS unreadable at the root, no jiffies, nothing
    countable — the descendants are not walked at all.

    ``counts`` is Linux-only (it matches command lines via
    :func:`process_matches`) and yields ``(None, None)`` elsewhere. ``pss`` is
    Linux-only too (``smaps_rollup``, kernel 4.14+): summed PSS charges each
    shared page to its sharers proportionally, so it is what the tree costs the
    host once, where summed VmRSS counts the code pages a tree of node /
    MCP-server processes shares once per process. ``smaps_rollup`` walks page
    tables, so it costs far more than a ``status`` read: for an occasional
    one-off reading, never a periodic sweep.

    Coverage caveat for a new caller: the walk reads
    ``/proc/<pid>/task/<tid>/children``, which needs ``CONFIG_PROC_CHILDREN`` and
    is documented as reliable only for frozen tasks, so a live tree can come back
    short. That is acceptable for the periodic per-process figures the two
    callers display; a reading that must not under-count (the RSS watchdog's
    recycle decision) uses ``session_pid._build_child_map`` instead, which pays a
    full ``/proc`` scan for completeness.

    """Bound *pid* and its descendants with a Windows Job object.

    The Windows analogue of ``sandbox.cgroup_scope_argv``:

    ==============================  ====================================
    cgroup v2                       Job object
    ==============================  ====================================
    ``TasksMax`` (fork bomb)        ``ActiveProcessLimit``
    ``MemoryMax`` (RSS balloon)     ``JobMemoryLimit``
    ==============================  ====================================

    The memory row is a true equivalent; the process row is NOT one-for-one.
    ``TasksMax`` counts tasks — every thread — while ``ActiveProcessLimit``
    counts processes, so the same numeric budget is a LOOSER bound here: a
    tree of N processes holds at least N tasks and usually many more. It still
    bounds a fork bomb, which is the control's purpose, but do not read the two
    limits as equal strictness, and do not "fix" the gap by scaling the number
    without deciding what a process budget should be — the units differ, so
    there is no arithmetic conversion between them.

    Enforcement is by DENIAL, matching the cgroup tier's practical behavior:
    once ``ActiveProcessLimit`` is reached the member's ``CreateProcess`` calls
    fail with ``ERROR_NOT_ENOUGH_QUOTA``, and an allocation past
    ``JobMemoryLimit`` fails, rather than the tree being killed outright.
    Nothing about process lifetime changes (see the ``KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE`` note
    above).

    Returns ``True`` when the limits were applied. Returns ``False`` — never
    raises — on POSIX (where ``cgroup_scope_argv`` owns this), on a non-positive
    limit, or on any Win32 failure; the caller treats that as "no ceiling
    enforced" exactly as it already treats the cgroup probe failing.

    Race-free ONLY when paired with :data:`CREATE_SUSPENDED`. Job membership
    covers a member's FUTURE descendants but not ones it already spawned, so
    assigning a *running* child leaves a window in which it could have forked
    something that escapes the job. Callers therefore create the child with
    ``creationflags |= CREATE_SUSPENDED`` — a suspended process has executed no
    instructions and so provably has no descendants — call this, then
    :func:`resume_process_main_thread`. That closes the window by construction
    rather than merely making it small. This function still works on an
    already-running pid (the ceiling then applies from that moment on); the
    suspended handshake is what makes it airtight.

# Compatibility facade. The cross-process file locks live in
# ``kiro_crew.platform_lock_compat`` and the owner-only access helpers (the
# process token's SID, the writability checks, ``restrict_to_owner`` and its
# directory form) in ``kiro_crew.platform_owner_compat``. Every name that moved
# stays readable as ``kiro_crew.platform_compat.<name>``, and every one of them is
# FORWARDED: ``__getattr__`` reads it from its owner, and ``_ReExportModule`` sends
# a write or delete there, so a patch of ``kiro_crew.platform_compat.<name>``
# reaches the owner's own callers. A forwarded name is absent from this module's
# namespace on purpose -- a binding here would shadow the owner for every later
# read -- and no code in this module reads one.
#
# The owners read what they need from this module -- the platform flags, the lock
# modules, the clock, ``ctypes`` and the Win32 struct layouts -- through a
# function-local import when they run, so a test that rebinds one of those here
# reaches them as it did before the move.
#
# ``test/test_platform_compat_refactor_facade.py`` pins both halves: a name a test
# patches through this module is forwarded, a forwarded name is never bound here,
# and each owner reads this module only through its listed function-local imports.
