"""The Linux namespace launcher: the program a sandboxed agent spawn runs first.

:func:`_build_launcher_script` renders that program as Python source text.
``kiro_crew.sandbox`` decides when a spawn needs it, materializes the mask targets
it names, writes the text to ``<config_dir>/run`` and invokes it
(``namespace_argv``). The program forks, unshares the user and mount namespaces,
stages the private windows, seals the READONLY dirs, bind-masks the SENSITIVE dirs,
applies the write carve-outs, scrubs the environment and execs the agent command.

``kiro_crew.sandbox`` re-exports the builder under its old name, and a patch of
``kiro_crew.sandbox._build_launcher_script`` lands here.

def _pin_mount_path(target, kind, require_present=False):
    """Resolve *target* ONCE and hand it on as a path that cannot be re-aimed.

    Every hiding mount below asks two things about one name: is there an object
    of the right KIND here, and then mount over it. Asking the name twice makes
    those two questions about two different lookups, so a name swapped in
    between is judged as the old object and bound as the new one -- the mask
    lands on whatever the name points at by then, while the bytes it exists to
    cover sit at a name nothing masks. The data home is writable by an
    already-running sandboxed process, so that racing writer is ordinary
    rather than exotic.

    The name is therefore resolved ONCE, into a descriptor, and the caller
    mounts over ``/proc/self/fd/<fd>``: that path names the object this
    descriptor holds, whatever the name says by then. ``O_PATH`` asks for no
    read permission, which matters because several masked leaves are 0600
    files this process cannot open for reading.

    *kind* is the ``stat`` predicate the caller requires -- ``S_ISDIR`` for a
    directory mask, ``S_ISREG`` for a file mask. Symlinks are FOLLOWED, exactly
    as a plain ``isdir``/``isfile`` guard follows them, so a supported symlinked
    data home keeps working; what the descriptor changes is only that the object
    the mask covers is the object that was classified.

    THE FIRST LOOK DOES NOT FOLLOW, and that is a separate property from the
    one above. A link occupying a protected name has two unrelated causes and
    they need opposite answers: an ordinary ``stow`` or ``chezmoi`` layout has
    had one there since before the gateway started, and refusing it would fail
    every strict spawn on a supported machine; a link SUBSTITUTED for a
    directory while this launcher looks is a redirect, and following it masks
    the planter's decoy while the real directory, renamed aside, stays
    readable. No single instant separates them -- both show a link -- so this
    does not try to. It opens the name once WITHOUT following, reports the
    identity of whatever occupied it, and lets the caller hand that identity
    back on a later call. A link that was already there is the same link at
    both looks and passes. A directory replaced by a link is not, and refuses.

    ``O_PATH | O_NOFOLLOW`` is what makes the first look possible without
    charging the supported layout: it does not refuse a link, it returns a
    descriptor on the link ITSELF, which is how the kind is told apart from the
    identity. ``O_DIRECTORY | O_NOFOLLOW`` would refuse instead, and that
    refusal lands on the stow layout rather than on the planter.

    The expected occupant is never passed in. It is looked up from
    ``MASK_OCCUPANTS`` -- what a pre-spawn pass recorded for this name -- so every
    call site is covered by construction, and a name no pass observed carries no
    expectation and is judged on kind alone.

    THE NAME IS NEVER RESOLVED AS A WHOLE PATH TWICE. The parent directory is
    opened once and held, the no-follow first look happens relative to that
    descriptor, and when a link holds the name its target is read from the
    descriptor already open ON THAT LINK rather than by looking the name up
    again. Resolving the name a second time would put a fresh whole-path lookup
    after the occupant comparison, which is exactly the check being bypassed:
    the comparison would pass on the object the first look saw while the mask
    bound whatever the name reached a moment later. Reading the link through its
    own descriptor has no such window, and it is also immune to a replacement
    link that reuses the old inode -- an identity comparison after the fact is
    not.

    THE TWO FAILURES ARE NOT THE SAME FAILURE, and collapsing them is how a
    mask goes missing in silence:

    * NOTHING OF THAT KIND IS HERE -- the name does not exist, or holds an
      object of the other kind. That is a SKIP, and it has to be, because it is
      exactly what the plain guards did: every caller-supplied path is offered
      to both the directory loop and the file loop, and each takes the entries
      of its own kind. Returns ``(None, None)``. A name that vanishes mid-call
      lands here too, as ``ENOENT``, and skips for the same reason -- only
      *require_present*, or a carried expectation, turns that into a refusal.
    * SOMETHING IS HERE AND CANNOT BE PINNED -- ``open`` is denied where
      ``stat`` succeeded (a restriction inherited from the parent process does
      exactly this, as the ``EXPOSE_FILES`` pre-read below records), or the name
      resolves to something that cannot be opened at all. The caller asked for
      this path to be masked and it exists, so skipping would exec the agent
      with it VISIBLE and no line anywhere saying so. Refuses the spawn instead.

    One knob turns a skip into a refusal. *require_present* refuses ABSENCE
    alone, for a target a pre-spawn materialiser established: the object was
    there moments ago, so an empty name now means the name moved. It deliberately
    leaves the wrong-KIND skip alone, because both loops are offered every path
    and the one that does not cover this object meets it in normal operation.
    The carried expectation, looked up here from ``MASK_OCCUPANTS`` and never
    passed in, is what refuses a CHANGED object of either kind.

    Returns ``(fd, path)`` on a match, ``(None, None)`` on a skip. The caller MUST
    keep *fd* open until its mount returns, because the proc path lives only as
    long as the descriptor, and MUST close it afterwards.

    SCOPE, because the difference matters and the name does not carry it: this runs ONCE,
    at spawn, and answers one question -- did the mask this loop just mounted land on the
    name the caller configured. It is not a standing guarantee about that name for the
    life of the namespace. Nothing re-checks afterwards, so an atomic replacement of the
    name later (a same-uid regular file swapped in by the operator's own Dev Fleet
    cutover, for instance) is not detected by this or by anything downstream of it. Read
    it as a spawn-time assertion, never as a durable anchor; making a protected name
    resist replacement for the whole namespace lifetime is a mechanism this function does
    not contain and does not attempt.

    Pinning the target closes one half of the window: the mount covers the
    object the classification inspected, whatever the name says by then. The
    NAME is the other half. A rename landing between the pin and the mount
    leaves the mask on the object that was inspected while the name reaches the
    racing writer's replacement -- and that is not a leak of what was there, it
    is a WRITABLE object at a protected name. Several of these names are read
    back by the gateway as authoritative, so a writable stand-in at one of them
    buys an agent records the gateway trusts.

    So the name is resolved once more, after the mount, and REQUIRED to reach
    the stand-in this mask just bound -- by the identity the caller pinned BEFORE
    mounting (:func:`_stand_in_identity`), never by re-resolving the stand-in's
    own path, which sits in a shared tmpfs a racing writer can re-aim. A mismatch
    means the name escaped its mask, and the spawn refuses rather than running
    with that name writable. This is the same re-resolve-and-refuse step the
    read-only ceiling seal performs for its own remount, applied to the hiding
    mounts.

        # self-bind were established AFTER the carve-out, lookups through the
        # new parent mount would not find the carve-out mount at all and the
        # writable window would vanish silently — the #8653 failure back with
        # no error. Clearing MS_RDONLY here is permitted because the seal

        # MNT_LOCK_READONLY (a data home on a genuinely read-only underlying
        # mount could not have produced the carve-out directory at all); the

        # Only credential inodes with st_nlink > 1 enter the match set: an
        # inode with a single link has no alias anywhere on the filesystem, so
        # when every credential has nlink == 1 the walk is skipped entirely
        # and the common healthy-host spawn pays nothing. When a walk does
        # run, each root gets its OWN scan budget so a large workspace cannot
        # starve the /tmp scan (the world-writable root this check exists
        # for). On budget exhaustion the scan deliberately degrades OPEN with
        # a stderr warning rather than failing closed: /tmp on a busy host can
        # exceed any fixed budget from ordinary telemetry/cache churn, and
        # exiting here would break every sandbox spawn on such hosts. The cost,
        # plainly: an alias past the budget -- or past the quieter depth limit
        # below -- is never stat'd, so a second path to a credential inode goes
        # unchecked even though every mount held.
        #
        # REGULAR FILES ONLY, and that guard is what keeps the walk rare. Linux
        # does not allow a hardlink to a directory, so nlink > 1 says nothing
        # about a directory — and every directory has nlink >= 2 for `.` and
        # `..`. `SENSITIVE_FILES` deliberately carries every hidden path of BOTH

        # so without this check two ordinary directories — `~/.kiro/crew-auth-staging`
        # and `~/.gnupg` on the measuring host — seeded the match set on every
        # spawn. The 100k-entry walk of $CWD and /tmp then ran every time, costing
        # 1.5s per sandboxed spawn and emitting the truncation warning constantly,
