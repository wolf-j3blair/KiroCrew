# A path-only bypass is unsound whenever another route pattern also matches the

# methods, not just the self-authenticating one it was written for. Scoping the
# entry to the method whose handler does its own auth leaves the rest on the
# ordinary token gate. Every self-authenticating webhook belongs here rather than
# in the path-only set above, whether or not another route currently collides —
# the collision is a property of the route table, which moves.
#
# ``POST /api/hooks/agent`` is the inbound agent webhook: external systems (CI
# runners, code-review bots, deploy pipelines) post here holding a webhook token
# and nothing else — no dashboard cookie, no gateway IPC secret. The handler does
# its OWN auth (api_hooks_agent -> _verify_hook_token compares the bearer against
# the sha256 of every stored token entry with hmac.compare_digest and refuses
# with 401 when none match, including when no token exists at all, so the
# endpoint is closed by default on a fresh install). It is a deliberate exposure
# decision: a valid token authorizes a real agent turn with full tool access, so
# the handler also rate-limits repeated failures per source
# (webhooks.auth_throttle) and records every 401 in the run history.
#
# For that entry the method scope is load-bearing, not tidiness. The literal
# string ``agent`` also matches the ``{hook_id}`` wildcard of the dashboard's own
# hook CRUD routes — PUT and DELETE ``/api/hooks/{hook_id}`` — whose handler
# (api_hook_detail) authenticates via the dashboard token alone. Unscoped, both
# reach it with no credential of any kind.
#
# ``POST /api/messaging/teams`` is the Microsoft Teams inbound webhook: Bot
# Framework (Microsoft's servers, no dashboard cookie) posts activities there and
# the handler does its OWN auth, validating the Bot Framework JWT (issuer +
# App-ID audience + signature) before processing. Only POST is routed today, so
# the scope closes nothing yet — it is here so the shape a future entry gets
# copied from is the safe one.

# Exact-path exemptions from the CSRF **Origin** check, path -> allowed methods.
# A separate map from the token-auth bypass above, deliberately: skipping the
# cookie gate and skipping the Origin check are two different grants, and a route
# may need one without the other.
#
# ONE entry, and adding a second is a security review rather than a copy of this
# line. `/api/hooks/agent` shares the shape -- self-authenticating, cookie-less,
# server-to-server -- and is in the token-auth bypass above, but it is NOT here:
# no reported failure named it, its own proxy topologies already work, and a
# perimeter exemption is far harder to withdraw once a caller depends on it than
# it is to add later with its own cause.
#
# WHY dropping the Origin check is sound for the Teams route: CSRF exists to stop
# a BROWSER making a cross-origin state-changing request that the browser then
# decorates with the victim's cookies. ``api_teams_activity`` reads no cookie at
# all, so there is nothing for a cross-origin page to ride; it authenticates the
# Bot Framework JWT instead (issuer, App-ID audience, RS256 signature over the
# Bot Framework JWKS, expiry). A cross-origin page can neither obtain nor forge
# one, so an Origin the check would have rejected buys an attacker nothing.
#
# WHY the exemption is REQUIRED and not a convenience: the Connector is
# server-to-server and sends neither ``Origin`` nor ``Referer``.
# ``origin.check_origin`` trusts a header-less request only from a loopback peer
# or the dashboard's unix socket, so such a POST arriving straight at the gateway
# is refused 403 before the credential is ever examined -- which is the "public
# hostname on a VM/App Service" topology in ``docs/teams-integration.md``.
# Nothing an operator can configure widens it: unlike the Host allowlist, which
# ``dashboard.url`` feeds, there is no setting that admits an Origin-less
# non-loopback POST.
#
# The METHOD scope is load-bearing: only POST is exempt, so the ``PUT``/``DELETE``
# ``/api/hooks/{hook_id}`` CRUD routes -- whose handler authenticates by dashboard
# token alone -- keep their Origin check even though the literal ``agent`` matches
# their wildcard.

    away the one fact that decides whether a declared key belongs here at all:
    an arm that learns "one session lives on this pid" and not "which" has to
    accept whatever key it is handed.

    The published mapping is the same answer written to disk, and disk is not a
    trustworthy place to ask this question: the pair sits in the data-home root,
    which is writable inside the agent sandbox, so a co-tenant can simply UNLINK
    it. Absence then reads as "nothing resolved", which is the permissive arm --
    a plain unlink would otherwise buy the attacker the attestation-free path
    that publishing the roster exists to close. Per-turn republication bounds
    that window but does not close it, because the deleter picks its moment.

    So for the case where nothing resolved on disk, the manager is asked
    directly. It answers from memory, in this same process, about runtimes it
    owns, and an agent cannot edit it. The chain is walked peer-first for the
    same reason the disk walk is: the peer is an MCP server whose kiro-cli
    ANCESTOR is the pid sessions are keyed by.

    Returns an EMPTY set when the manager knows none of these pids, which is the
    ordinary answer for the callers the permissive arm exists for -- a cron
    script, a warm-pool runtime before claim, a pooled backend outside this
    manager. Empty is therefore "no evidence", never "not shared", and the caller
    treats it as such. Every failure path answers empty for the same reason: a
    probe that could not ask must not become a verdict.

    The set is NOT a closed account of the pid's tenancy. A ``spawn_run`` shared
    subagent's session lives on its parent's ``_shared_provider`` and is never
    registered with the manager, so its key can be missing from a set that names
    its parent. That is why a declared key absent from a NON-EMPTY set takes the
    attestation arm rather than a flat denial: absent-from-roster and

    Verify-when-resolvable, deny-on-mismatch, degrade-to-status-quo when

    (where the header was accepted entirely on the caller's word):

    * peer uid positively ≠ ours (``MISMATCH``) → deny. Cannot normally
      happen (the socket sits in the 0700 data home), so a hit means the
      directory gate failed — exactly when denying matters most.

      host → proceed with ``request["peer_verified"] = True``. On a 1:1 runtime
      that is the pid's single mapped key, and the kernel's process attestation
      settles it: one session lives there, so there is no other identity the
      caller could be mistaken for.
    * on a SHARED runtime the pid names several sessions, and membership is
      necessary but NOT sufficient. The mapping's MAC stops an agent ADDING
      itself to a pid's membership, but every co-tenant can READ the list, so
      one of them could declare a sibling's recorded key — and the key admitted
      here is what ``derive_caller_app`` derives app confinement from. So a
      shared pid additionally requires an ``X-Session-Token`` that verifies to
      the declared key: it is MAC'd under the agent-unreadable SEL trust root,
      names ONE session, and every caller that declares a key already sends it.
      Admitted here the call is SEL-recorded rather than debug-logged, because
      this is the arm where a cross-session declaration would have landed.
      The token is required on EVERY shared-pid arm, including the one whose
      roster the mapping file's size bound truncated: truncation is a normal
      publisher outcome, so a roster short of the declared key withholds
      membership evidence without withdrawing the demand for attestation.
    * the peer's full membership is known and the declared key is NOT in it →
      deny 403 + SEL ``dashboard.peer-identity-mismatch`` (the impersonation
      this check exists to close: a same-uid process declaring another
      session's identity).

      today's semantics: no new denial. No peer pid mechanism, no
      ``session_pid_<pid>`` file in the ancestry (warm-pool runtimes before
      claim, cron scripts, pooled MCP backends), or a pid proven recycled.
      A truncated roster is NOT one of these: it carries positive evidence of

        elsewhere is refused ``peer_session_unbound``. Stolen-token reach shrinks
        from "any session whose env is readable" to "a session this process
        actually hosts", which is the set the roster already admits. Tables that
        cannot speak about the pid answer empty and change nothing.

        *hosts* is the tenancy the denial was actually decided against, or
        ``None`` on the one arm that measured no count at all. It is
        keyword-only with NO default on purpose: a default resolves to
        ``tenancy.tenant_count``, which is ``0`` on every arm reached without a
        resolved mapping, so a denial taken BECAUSE the live manager reported
        several sessions would record ``hosts 0 sessions`` — a trail
        contradicting the decision it explains and indistinguishable from a pid
        that genuinely hosts none. An unmeasured tenancy therefore carries its
        own wording rather than a zero, and a new arm cannot inherit a silent
        count.

        Returns a deny response, or ``None`` having marked the request verified.

    **Why this exists.** App-ownership checks gate on ``request["app"]``, which
    the app-token branch publishes. The internal-secret branch (the managed MCP
    set) carries no app claim at all: the secret proves the call came from
    inside, not who made it. Without this, every ownership check is a no-op on
    that transport, and an app agent granted ``@kirocrew-dashboard`` arrives
    indistinguishable from the dashboard user.

    The identity comes from the authenticated CALLING SESSION, resolved against
    server-side registries in four steps -- one per way a session can be owned:
    the slot the key names, the slot RUNNING under that key
    (``linked_session_key``), for a cron key the job's ``created_by`` owner tag,
    and for a subagent key the child record's spawning ``app``. The agent cannot
    forge the key — it does not build the request; the in-process MCP broker sets
    it from the calling session's own context and never from tool arguments
    (``mcp_core`` ``_resolve_session_key_strict``), and on an AF_UNIX transport
    ``_verify_unix_peer`` has already kernel-attested it against ``/proc``
    ancestry before this runs.

    ``""`` means "no app owns this caller" and is returned both when the person
    is the caller and when the caller cannot be placed at all. The two are not
    distinguished because no site acts differently on them; the one route that
    needs the difference for a ``dashboard:`` key asks
    :func:`caller_names_a_missing_slot` instead.

    Deliberately PURE — every parameter is a server-side registry or the
    caller's own key, never a request — so the middleware and the one route that
    also re-derives for defense-in-depth share a single implementation that
    cannot drift. Never derive from a request BODY or from tool arguments: a
