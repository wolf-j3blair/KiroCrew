    Answers one of :data:`DISMISSAL_LOG_ABSENT`,
    :data:`DISMISSAL_LOG_COMMITTED` or :data:`DISMISSAL_LOG_FAILED`. The last two
    are the distinction a boolean could not carry: both mean a unit holds this
    child, so the run exists and an unknown-id answer would be wrong, while only
    one of them means the card is actually cleared.

    This is the record the PANEL reads. Its durable half is a fold of the session's
    crew log, so the dismissal belongs there: kept anywhere else it is a second
    record of a fact about the session, reclaimed on its own schedule. The folder
    registry below this is the case in point -- it is keyed on the run's folder at
    both ends, so it forgets a dismissal when that folder is pruned, while the fold
    still draws the child the log kept.

    The owning UNIT is resolved in two steps, cheapest first.
    :func:`crew_log.emit.dismiss_child` answers from the emitter's own spawn pin,
    which is the unit the child's ``subagent/spawned`` was written to; the terminal
    report releases that pin, so it answers only for a child still running, and a
    gateway restart clears it entirely. Then the LOG is searched, over the units
    each live slot has run under -- which is the same question the panel's own read
    answers, and the only one that cannot name the wrong unit: a slot owns one ACP
    session id at a time, so a child dispatched before a reset sits in a retired
    unit that the slot's current id does not name.

    ``ABSENT`` when no unit holds the child, which is not a failure: there is then
    no folded card to clear, and the caller's folder record still answers for a
    pre-existing one. ``ABSENT`` also when the crew log is switched off, where an
    install that opted out of the record has no record to write to.

    Each append is waited on until it COMMITS, because the caller publishes a
    dismissal to the user on the strength of this answer, and once the run's folder
    has been reclaimed this entry is the only record of it.
