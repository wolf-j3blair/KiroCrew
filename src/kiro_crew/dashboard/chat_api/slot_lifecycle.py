    Retire this slot's loop at the moment the user dismissed the tab.
    "Respect the close" cannot rest on the fire path's rehydrate miss, because
    the fire path adopts THROUGH that miss (see ``_fire_dashboard_nudge``'s
    ``adopt_closed``) or idle archival kills loops terminally. Making the user's
    ✕ the explicit retirement keeps the rule intact without relying on a cache
    miss to enforce it.

    The initial call MUST happen BEFORE the close path's first await, and the
    app-owned path calls it again after its close hook. Two reasons, both of
    which resurrect a session the user closed:

    * The loop's timer can EXPIRE during an await of the close (the turn-cancel
      wait, the history persist, the session teardown). The slot is already out
      of ``state._slots`` by then, so the fire path takes its rehydrate branch
      and restores the transcript with ``adopt_closed=True`` — the very
      transcript the persist is marking closed.
    * Cancelling ``slot.task`` runs ``_run_chat``'s finally, which re-arms the
      timer through ``notify_turn_complete``. Disarming without removing is
      therefore not enough: the clock comes straight back mid-close.

    ``remove_by_slot()`` is what makes this generation-safe: it acquires the
    maintenance transaction before resolving the current loop, so a queued arm
    either lands first and is removed or runs after the synchronous slot pop.
    Its uncontended acquire does not yield, so the initial retirement also
    cancels a scheduled timer before the fire callback gets another turn.
    Legacy loops are removed. Structured monitors instead retain their durable
    outcome and clear their timer, so terminal history remains inspectable.

    The returned loop lets the persist-failure path put the clock back (see
    :func:`_restore_slot_nudge_loop`).

    A removal that FAILS raises :exc:`_NudgeRetireFailed` rather than logging and
    carrying on. Removal drops the loop from memory first and only then writes
    the registry, so a write that raises leaves memory retired while the DISK
    still lists the loop. Swallowing that let the close finish and persist
    the slot as closed, and the next start read the surviving record back: the
    fire path answers the missing slot with ``adopt_closed=True``, so the loop
    rebuilt the dismissed session and ran an unattended turn in it. Locating a
    session the user closed is exactly the outcome this function exists to
    prevent, so the close must not proceed on a half-applied retirement.

    """POST /api/chat/slots/{slot}/reset-conversation — a fresh conversation, same slot.

    Drops the slot's resume pointer, so its next turn cold-starts a new native
    conversation instead of ``session/load``-ing the accumulated one. Everything
    else survives: the slot stays open, its transcript stays on disk, and the
    session-map ENTRY keeps its channel linkage.

    This capability existed internally with no way to ask for it. Resume is
    key-driven — ``resume_sid = self._session_map.get(key)`` — and a slot key is
    stable by design, so reopening one continues where it left off. That is the
    point for a tab the user closed and came back to. It is NOT what a caller
    wants after a long-lived conversation has drifted, filled up, or outlived the
    thing it was about; and until now the only way to break the link was to
    DELETE the session from history, which destroys the record to reset the
    pointer. This separates the two.

    ``discard_conversation``, not ``destroy``: the entry also carries the Slack
    thread/channel linkage and the reverse index built from it, so dropping the
    row would silently unlink a mirrored session. The dropped value is stashed as
    ``discarded_sid``, so this is diagnosable and reversible by hand.

    It is nonetheless a FULL teardown — it shuts the provider down and releases
    the shared sub-agent runtime — so it takes the same guards the sibling
    teardown route does, through the same shared helpers rather than a third
    policy of its own: authorization on the SESSION (not merely the slot),
    ``provider.has_active_turn()``, ``running``, and the sub-agent gate. Each of
    the three protects work the caller cannot see from the outside: a turn
    running on the session with no dashboard task behind it (an inbound channel
    message), a turn mid-write, and children still running after their parent's
    turn ended.

    The ``has_active_turn()`` check is a best-effort fast path; the
    authoritative guard is the discard's ``skip_if_busy``, which probes the
    per-session SEMAPHORE atomically with the session pop (see
    :meth:`SessionManager.discard_conversation`). The fast path has a known
    edge — a turn holding the semaphore but not yet having a prompt in flight
    is invisible to it — and the atomic guard is what closes it, the same
    contract the sibling reload route rests on, so the two teardowns keep one
    notion of "busy". Of the refusal paths, only the atomic guard's decline is
    SEL-recorded (``outcome="denied"``): it is the one refusal that happens
    after the route has committed to the teardown, while the fast-path 409s
    are pre-checks and stay unlogged, as they are on the sibling.

    The transcript is deliberately left in place, which means the tab still shows
    the earlier messages while the model does not remember them. That is the
    honest rendering of what happened — the record is the user's, the context was
    the conversation's — and it is why this is a deliberate action rather than
    something the gateway does on its own.

    modes; "the conductor was not told early" is not one of them, because the conductor's
    scheduled tick reads the same ledger a cadence later. So every failure here is a

    hand-over exit's tail drain landed. Never between the pop and the save. The
    conductor's probe answers "is this worker closed" by looking the slot up, and a
    ``worker_closed`` answer persists a stall observation that no rollback retracts; a
    tick fired in that window would read the popped slot as gone, and the save's
    failure arm would then put the slot back under a permanent false "worker gone".

    Non-destructive: the conversation is saved to history (``closed=True``) and
    recreated from the warm pool if the tab is resumed later — nothing is
    permanently deleted here.

    Shared by :func:`api_chat_slot_delete` and ``session_control.close_target``
    so neither can diverge on the ordering invariants that keep a nudge or an
    app watchdog from resurrecting the very tab being dismissed. The four
    failure paths raise :class:`SlotCloseError`, leaving the slot open with every
    partial step rolled back; the caller renders the refusal in its own idiom
    (an HTTP response, or a ``SessionControlError``). The APP-OWNERSHIP check is
    deliberately NOT here — it is DELETE-endpoint policy (App Kit isolation for
    app tokens) and stays in that handler; session control scopes the caller
    through ``authorize_target`` instead.

    ``pre_pop_check`` runs SYNCHRONOUSLY at the point of no return — immediately
    before the slot is popped, after the nudge-retirement and app-hook awaits. It
    exists for a caller (``close_target``) that authorized the target BEFORE this
    coroutine and must re-assert that authorization against state those awaits
    could have changed: a target unmirrored/unlinked at admission can gain a
    channel mirror or link while the AutoNudge lock and the app hook are awaited,
    and archiving a now-channel-backed session it was never allowed to reach is
    the boundary the target guards exist to hold. It is SYNCHRONOUS on purpose —
    an awaited check would put a suspension back between the last retirement and
    the pop (reopening the retired-loop window) and between the re-authorization
    and the pop (reopening the mirror window); a synchronous check has neither, so
    nothing can change between the final authorization and the archival. It must
    therefore do no blocking I/O (``close_target`` passes ``skip_enabled_check=True``
    so its ``authorize_target`` never reads config on the loop). It raises
    :class:`SlotCloseError` to abort; the abort unwinds the teardown so far (the
    retired nudge loop is restored, an app notification is taken back) and
    re-raises, exactly like the persist-failure path. The human ✕ path passes
    ``None`` — the person owns the tab and closes it unconditionally.
