"""Per-app WebSocket event scope enforcement.

App tokens connected to /api/ws must only receive events they are authorised to
see, based on the ``permissions.events`` declarations in their ``app.json``.


## Event tiers

Tier 0 — always delivered to every connected client (no sensitive payload):
    ``dashboard``  — gateway status snapshot (version, cron count, etc.)

Tier 1 — slot-scoped: delivered only when the calling app is allowed to see the
    slot that the event belongs to.  All events carrying a ``slot`` field fall into
    this tier.  Visibility is controlled by the ``slots:*`` and ``subagent:*``
    declarations in ``permissions.events`` (see below).

Tier 2 — global events with no ``slot`` field.  An app must explicitly list the
    event name (or a wildcard scope) in ``permissions.events`` to receive it.

## Slot visibility scopes (``slots:*``)

Declaration             Slots visible
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(default / slots:own)   Only slots where owner_app == self
slots:user              All slots where origin == SlotOrigin.USER
slots:app:<name>        Slots owned by ``<name>`` — requires ``<name>`` to
                        declare this app in its ``exposeToApps`` list
slots:all               All slots (broad -- see the note on self-declaration below)

The same scope also controls which slot-scoped subagent events are visible.
The ``subagent:*`` declarations are an independent, additive dimension:

Declaration             Subagent events visible (overrides slots:* for subagent events)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
(default / subagent)    Own slots only (same as slots:own)
subagent:user           Subagents in user-initiated slots
subagent:app:<name>     Subagents in <name>'s slots (requires exposeToApps opt-in)
subagent:all            All subagent events (broad)

## Global event declarations (``permissions.events``)

notification            Own app's notifications (source_app == self) only.
                        Foreign and system-sourced notifications still denied.
notification:system     Gateway-internal pushes with no source_app -- cron
                        results, send_message, watchlist output. Separate from
                        ``notification`` because that stream is user content
                        rather than the app's own: bundling them would make
                        one declaration a broad grant, the very shape this
                        module exists to remove.
notification_ack / notification_unack carry only a timestamp, so they cannot be
attributed to a source at all and need `notification:all`.
notifications_clear carries no payload at all -- it fires when the WHOLE log is
cleared, not one app's slice -- so it needs `notification:all` for the same reason.
notification_channel_settings IS attributable -- its channel is `<app>.<id>` or
`system.<kind>` -- so own-channel settings ride `notification`, system channels
ride `notification:system`, and foreign channels need `notification:all`.
notification:all        All notifications regardless of source (broad).
sessions                sessions_restarting, session_health_changed
                        (``session_health_changed`` is a bare ``{"ts": ...}``
                        refresh signal -- it reports THAT the health verdict
                        moved, never what it says)
yolo                    yolo_expired
artifacts               artifact_update ({slug, version, deleted}; metadata only)
workflow_run_event      Declared by its own literal name -- already the correct
                        per-event Tier 2 shape, and the only events declaration
                        present in the tree today (the workflows app).
log                     Gateway log stream (broad)
browser                 browser_event (broad)

## Scope declarations are SELF-declared

Every scope above is read from the app's own ``app.json``. Nothing in this module
consults an install-time approval, so an app can widen itself by writing
``slots:all`` into its manifest -- which is consistent with the trust model
(installing an app already grants it in-process gateway privilege) but means the
tiers are a *structuring* mechanism plus an audit trail, not a barrier against a
hostile manifest. The one asymmetric check is ``exposeToApps``: cross-app
visibility requires consent from the app being observed, because there the
manifest being trusted is not the one being widened.

Gating the broad scopes through the install-time consent path
(``apps/admission.py``) is tracked separately.

## Dashboard users (empty app claim) are unaffected — they get the full stream.

    reason: that gate answers "may this app receive subagent events for this
    slot" from the slot's CURRENT owner, which is the right question for a live
    run and the wrong one for a run read back off disk. Slot keys are
    caller-supplied and are not namespaced by app, so the key an app's run was
    recorded under can later be created by a DIFFERENT app -- and the gate would
    then admit the old run to the new owner. The run's own recorded app is the
    missing half of the decision, so it is compared here.

    Two refusals, not one, because they mean different things and an operator
    reads the reason: ``slot_missing`` is the same reason the live gate gives when
    no slot answers the key, which on a lazily hydrated slot is ordinary rather
    than adversarial; ``persisted_owner_mismatch`` is a real cross-owner refusal.
    Collapsing them would file every cold-start reconnect as a security event and
    dilute the stream the real one has to be visible in.

    matches only a slot no app owns, so an app never receives a person's run and
    a person never receives an app's. ``get_slot`` is deliberate over a raw

# otherwise leave the revoked scopes usable on an already-open connection until
# it happens to drop.
#
# ``effective_allowed_events`` therefore INTERSECTS the connect-time snapshot
# with the currently declared set on every decision. Intersection, not
# replacement, is the whole design:
#
#   * a NARROWED or deleted manifest takes effect immediately (the point), and
#   * a WIDENED manifest does NOT retroactively grant an open socket new scopes
#     — that requires a reconnect, so the grant is always one the connection was
#     authenticated for, and a manifest edit can never escalate a live session.
#
# Closing the socket instead was rejected: it would cut a streaming turn
# mid-flight and turn a manifest save into a reconnect storm, while delivering
# no tighter guarantee than withholding the events does.
#
# The reload is the same shape as the ``exposeToApps`` cache above — never a
# disk read on the loop, refreshed off-loop, stale-while-revalidate — because
# this runs on the same synchronous broadcast path. The one difference is what a
# COLD miss returns: an unknown ``exposeToApps`` denies (a cross-app grant is
# opt-in), but an unknown declaration set must fall back to the CONNECT-TIME
# SNAPSHOT rather than to empty, or the first broadcast after a gateway restart
# would withhold every event from every app until the refresh lands. The
# snapshot is itself an authenticated read of the same file, so leaning on it
# for one refresh interval never widens anything.

    ENABLEMENT is part of the answer, not a separate concern: ``disable_app``
    flips ``enabled`` in ``installed.json`` and leaves ``app.json`` untouched, so
    reading the manifest alone reports a disabled app's declarations unchanged and
    the intersection would keep honouring them.

    Both facts come back from ONE read, and are cached as one tuple, because they
    are only sound together: the empty declaration set of a disabled app is
    indistinguishable from that of an enabled app which declares no events, and
    those two must be treated differently (the latter still sees its OWN slots by
    documented default, the former must see nothing but Tier 0). A second cache
    keyed independently could report ``enabled`` for a set that was read while the
    app was disabled.

    An app that is disabled or uninstalled reports ``(False, frozenset())`` — no
    declarations AND revoked, so ``app_events_revoked`` also withholds the

    revocation and blanking the app's own chat over one would be a costly false
    positive. It still declares nothing, so every DECLARED scope is withheld.
