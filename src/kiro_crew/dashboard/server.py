    * **The dashboard is published on this machine's tailnet**, and

    ``caller`` is the label the middleware was built with (``dashboard_user``
    for the full dashboard, ``mcp_tool`` for the headless API server), or an
    identity a deny site already derived from the request.

    A FORWARDED request is filed under a DIFFERENT name. The gateway binds
    loopback, so remote access arrives through a same-host forwarder (a tunnel,
    a sidecar, a reverse proxy) which presents the credential it was given: with
    the owner's cookie that is indistinguishable from the owner sitting at the
    machine, and every such request was recorded as plain ``dashboard_user``.
    That is the one fact an operator reading the log afterwards most needs and
    could not get -- whether an action was taken by the person or arrived over a
    forwarding path on their behalf.

    The signal is :func:`origin.is_proxied_request`: any ``Forwarded`` /
    ``X-Forwarded-*`` / ``X-Real-IP`` header. It is the predicate the rest of
    this module already trusts for "``request.remote`` is not the client", and
    it over-warns rather than under-warns (a client that sends a forwarding
    header with no proxy in the path is reported as forwarded). For an audit
    label, over-warning is the safe direction: it never files a forwarded action
    as the person's own.

    Its known limit is the same one :func:`origin.is_direct_local_request`
    documents: a forwarder that strips every forwarding header is invisible
    here. This makes the ordinary product paths distinguishable, which is what
    the log could not do at all before; it is not a boundary against a forwarder
    that is deliberately hiding.

    An APP-token request is filed under the app's name, read from the ``app``
    claim ``token_auth_middleware`` publishes, rather than under ``caller``:
    otherwise every app call reads as the person's own action. That is the name
    every app-isolation row and the deny-audit boundary already record. An
    internal-secret request whose app claim was DERIVED from the calling session
    (a managed tool call made by an app's agent) keeps its transport in the
    label, ``<caller>:<app>``, so it is never filed as the app's own client. A
    request that carries no claim (the claim is ``""`` for the dashboard user,
    absent before token auth runs) keeps ``caller``.

    Shared by every middleware that denies BEFORE ``sel_audit_middleware`` runs
    (that one is registered inner to them, so a bare raise produces a 403 that
    appears nowhere in the audit log). One helper rather than per-site calls
    because the property below is easy to omit at a new deny site and
    invisible when omitted:

    * BEST-EFFORT — a trust root too short to sign the chain makes construction
      raise, and an unguarded write would turn the refusal into a 500: losing
      the denial in order to report it.

    No thread hop on the healthy path: the SEL singleton is warmed at startup
    (:func:`kiro_crew.sel.warm_sel_singleton`, awaited by both start paths
    before the middleware chain is built), so ``log_api_access`` here only
    enqueues to the writer thread (after its one-time start on first
    ``log()``). The warm is best-effort, though: when it FAILS, the
    next ``sel()`` retries ``_init_locked`` -- trust-dir creation, key load,
    a tail read of the log -- on the calling thread, and this helper runs on
    the event loop for every denied request. So the hop is kept for exactly
    that case, gated on :func:`kiro_crew.sel.sel_is_warm`: two attribute
    reads on the healthy path, a worker thread on the degraded one, never
    blocking file I/O on the loop. The ``except`` stays because construction
    can raise on either path.

    Calling this CLAIMS the request (:func:`origin.mark_audit_claimed`) so the
    deny-audit boundary outer to every barrier does not record the same refusal
    a second time. The claim is set unconditionally, before the write: a write
    that failed here fails identically in the boundary, so retrying in the
    boundary buys nothing.

    ``caller`` goes through :func:`audit_actor`, so a refusal that arrived
    through a forwarder is filed under ``<caller>_via_proxy``. Applied here, in
    the one helper every barrier's deny path already calls, rather than at each

    SHARED by BOTH entrypoints (``start_dashboard`` and the ``--slack-only``
    ``start_api_server``) so the two chains can never drift — same rationale as
    :func:`_make_host_validation_middleware`.

    ``sel_audit_middleware`` is registered INNER to the Host, CSRF and token
    barriers, so a refusal one of them raises produces a 403 that the audit
    middleware never observes. The three known sites each call
    :func:`_audit_denied` themselves and a source-string test pins that they keep
    doing so — but a pin only catches what someone remembers to run, and the
    omission is invisible in production: the refusal simply appears nowhere in
    the audit log. That is the deny-or-audit violation the pin exists to paper
    over.

    Registered OUTER to every barrier, this middleware makes the guarantee
    positional. It catches the refusal on its way out and records it unless some
    inner layer already claimed the request, so a future deny site that forgets
    everything is still audited; forgetting now costs the record's reason
    DETAIL, not the record. The per-site calls become enrichment rather than the
    guarantee.

    Its scope is deliberately narrow, so the audit surface is unchanged and no
    refusal is recorded twice:

    * Only a RAISED ``web.HTTPException`` whose status is in
      :data:`_PRE_AUDIT_DENY_STATUSES`. Everything else propagates untouched.
    * Only an UNCLAIMED request (:data:`origin.AUDIT_CLAIMED_KEY`). A layer claims
      when it has written the specific record itself: the two barriers through
      :func:`_audit_denied`, ``sel_audit_middleware`` for the requests it
      actually logs (so its ``outcome="error"`` entry for a handler's 403 is not
      doubled), and the two WebSocket origin refusals that log their own denial.
      All four go through :func:`origin.mark_audit_claimed`. Not claiming is the
      safe direction: the refusal is then recorded here under a generic reason.
      The one refusal that reaches this middleware unclaimed today is
      ``ws.py``'s cross-origin WebSocket 403, which was audited nowhere before.
    * Returned responses are NOT inspected. ``token_auth_middleware`` returns
      its 401/403 rather than raising and audits each with a specific reason
      code, so its records stay single.

    Best-effort and off the loop come from :func:`_audit_denied`; the refusal is
    re-raised unchanged either way, so an audit failure can never convert a 403
    into a 500.

    ``caller`` is only the FALLBACK label. A refusal raised inner to
    ``token_auth_middleware`` carries an authenticated identity on the request by
    the time it reaches here, and recording the static label instead would file an
    app's or a user's refusal under ``dashboard_user`` — the attribution problem
    ``handlers.terminal``'s own deny site avoids by reading
    ``request["user"]``. Note ``request["app"]`` is ``""`` for the dashboard user
    and that emptiness is POSITIVE proof of them (see ``token_auth``), so an empty
    app falls through to the user rather than to the label.

    """``_MIXED_INTERNAL_API_PATHS`` plus the edition's contributed paths.

    Both middleware construction sites build their mixed set through here — the
    dashboard chain and the headless ``--slack-only`` one — so the two can never
    disagree about which routes an internal loopback caller may reach. Drift
    there is an auth bug, not a cosmetic one.

    WHY A SEAM AT ALL. An edition mounts its routes through
    ``DashboardContributor.contribute_routes``, so the core cannot name those
    paths in a module-level frozenset. Without the contribution, an edition's own
    MCP tool authenticating with the loopback ``X-Internal-Secret`` handshake is
    not recognized as internal: token_auth ignores the secret, falls through to
    cookie auth, and the tool answers ``Token required`` on every call.

    TWO LIMITS THE CORE ENFORCES rather than trusting the contributor:

    * a contributed path matching a CORE STRICT entry is DROPPED. Strict and mixed
      differ off-loopback — strict hard-denies, mixed accepts a validated
      cookie — so admitting one would soften a route the core deliberately keeps
      loopback-only. The overlap is checked in BOTH directions (see
      :func:`_would_soften_a_strict_path`): a contributed ANCESTOR of a strict
      entry reclassifies it just as a child does. Dropping is audited, because a
      silently-ignored contribution and an honoured one look identical from the
      edition's side.
    * the result is a UNION, so a contribution can never remove a core entry. A
      contributor returning an unrelated or empty set is harmless by construction,
      which is why the read below can fail closed to "no contribution".

    Fail-closed through ``safe_context_call``, the idiom this repo centralizes for
    exactly this seam: a ``PlatformCompositionError`` is RE-RAISED, because a host
    that could not compose its companion must abort rather than fall back to
    open-source defaults, while any other contributor failure degrades to no
    contribution. A contributor that raises, hands back a generator that raises
    part-way through iteration, returns a non-iterable, or yields non-string
    entries therefore contributes nothing rather than widening the admitted set on
    a value the core could not check — and none of those can abort the gateway
    bind, which is what a raise escaping middleware construction would do.

    BOTH outcomes are recorded, because each is invisible to a different party: a
    dropped contribution is invisible to the EDITION, and an honoured one is
    invisible to the OPERATOR. So the admitted set is logged and SEL-audited at
    composition time alongside the drop audit — without it SEL cannot tell a
    deployment whose auth surface an edition widened from a stock one. A public
    build contributes nothing and stays silent.

# from cache for a minute (covering a burst of loads and a brief gateway
# restart with no round-trip), then re-fetch it — so a header-only change
# reaches the worker within a minute instead of a year, bounding the stale-CSP
# window to a minute of degraded highlight. ``no-store`` is wrong here: it would
# evict the bytes and make the worker unloadable the moment the gateway is
# unreachable, the very window ``immutable`` protects the entry bundle through.
# ``stale-if-error`` is added as a best-effort grant to a caching tunnel/proxy
# in front of the gateway; no mainstream browser honours it, so for a plain
# browser the gateway-down coverage is the ``max-age`` window alone.
#
# A worker chunk is identified by the ``worker`` substring in its filename
# (``diffWorker-``, ``hljsWorker-``, ``subset-worker.chunk-``,

    ``parse_dashboard_url`` substitute the default port — right for the server

    a gateway that may be bound elsewhere.

    Deliberately a DISTINCT variable from ``KIROCREW_PORT``: that one means

    ``KIROCREW_BOUND_PORT`` carries ephemeral truth only: consumed by
    ``port_resolution.resolve_client_port`` one step below the operator override,

    A client reaching the gateway by name rather than by address dials
    ``localhost``, which resolves to BOTH loopback families on an ordinary host.
    That name therefore identifies a SET of listeners, and whichever family the
    gateway did not bind is free for a co-resident process to take -- so a
    credential sent to the name can land on a party the gateway never was. Two
    ways out: rewrite the name to a literal at every call site, which moves the
    document's web origin and splits every comparison that holds the configured
    string; or hold both families, so the name can only reach this gateway.

    This is the second. Binding ``::1`` beside ``127.0.0.1`` (or the reverse)
    makes the ambiguity harmless rather than routed around, and the evidence a
    client needs is already published: one ``run/gateway-<port>-<address>.secret``
    per bound address, so "this gateway holds every family the name reaches" is
    readable from local disk with nothing asked of the peer.

    Strictly additive, in the sense ``_start_unix_site`` established: same
    :class:`web.AppRunner`, so both listeners serve the identical app and
    middleware chain, and ANY failure logs once and leaves the primary listener
    exactly as it is. Failure is the interesting case and it is safe: without the
    second entry a client dialling the name finds a family uncovered, refuses to
    send its secret, and falls through to the token prompt. That is one explicit
    sign-in, and it is the same cost a single-family gateway already pays.

    Deliberately NOT using the reclaim/retry ladder that guards the primary bind.
    A process already holding the other family's socket is precisely the threat
    this exists to exclude; reclaiming it would terminate a stranger's listener,
    and waiting for it would delay boot for a port the gateway does not need.
    One attempt, then degrade.

    Only the two loopback literals have a counterpart. A wildcard or an
    interface-specific bind is not a loopback family pair, and
    ``KIROCREW_BIND=<something else>`` is an operator naming one listener on
    purpose, so neither gets a second socket.

    sender, never an address chosen here. Each channel is independent: one that

    **Exactly one candidate across EVERY channel, or nothing.** This notice carries the

    has an owner id and is preferred above; nothing else does. An allow-list is a list of
    people permitted to TALK to the agent, not a claim that any of them is the operator.

    So the only sound inference is a counting one, and it has to be counted across the
    whole install rather than per channel. Two channels each holding a DIFFERENT single
    identity is two people, and delivering to both hands one of them the other's security
    state — a per-channel "exactly one target" rule misses that entirely. With exactly one
    reachable person in the whole configuration, that person is the operator; with two or
    more, refuse everybody. Same premise as `/sessions`' owner-only rule.

    Counted over ALL configured targets, not just the reachable ones: a three-person
    allow-list where only one route happens to have been learned is still a guess.

    on two channels reads as two candidates and gets no channel notice. The dashboard feed

    migration, merges but keeps its copies while the event is clear and

    The pass reads ``crewmate_prune_abandon`` before each candidate and again
    inside the config lock before each delete; that helper sets it when the
    pass outlives its budget, and the pass then finishes without deleting.
    The pass itself takes a cross-process lock beside its marker for its whole
    length, so a second gateway on the same data home cannot run its own pass
    beside this one -- its pass waits on that lock (its writers held by its
    own barrier meanwhile) and then finds the marker. On every boot but the

    on a 2.96 GB corpus, against ~0.3 s indexed).

    The indexing itself runs in a spawned child process, not here. It is
    pure-Python CPU (read, ``casefold``, project, insert), so as an
    ``asyncio.to_thread`` call it held the GIL that this gateway's event loop
    needs: ``py-spy top --gil`` attributed 28% of all GIL-holding samples to it,
    and the loop showed ``event-loop heartbeat: lag 1.0-6.6s`` on an 84%-idle
    machine. See ``kiro_crew.history_index_worker`` for why a process rather than
    a thread, why spawn rather than fork, and why deletion stays here.

    This gateway keeps only the read-only query path, plus the one index write
    that belongs to deletion (``delete_session`` removes a session's indexed text
    before unlinking the transcript and aborts if it cannot).

    What is left here is supervision: start the child, restart it if it dies,
    stop it when this gateway stops. Three things retire the child, and the
    order matters because the first two can be skipped: this task's ``finally``
    asks it to stop, ``daemon=True`` has ``multiprocessing`` reap it at
    interpreter exit, and failing both the child retires ITSELF once it sees this
    process is gone. Only the third survives a hard exit — the shutdown and
    restart paths can end this process with ``os._exit``, which runs no
    ``atexit`` handler, so neither parent-side path is guaranteed to run. That is
    why the child re-checks its parent on a short slice rather than once per pass:
    it bounds how long an orphan can keep indexing beside its replacement.

    A failure to keep a child running is logged once and then left alone: a
    missing row costs one scanned file, so the honest response to an indexer that
    will not stay up is to keep serving searches from the transcripts.

        and both run the DROP — the later one discarding the tables the earlier
        one just built, along with anything indexed in between. Nothing
        authoritative is lost (the rows derive from transcripts) but search falls

    Converges non-canonical loopback aliases (127.0.0.1 / ::1 / localhost) onto
    *canonical_host* with a 302 so the SPA's per-origin localStorage settings
    are not split across hostnames. Only top-level document GET/HEAD navigations
    are redirected (see :func:`should_canonicalize_host`); APIs, WebSockets, and
    sub-resource fetches are untouched. Pass ``canonical_host=""`` (e.g. when not
    local_only) to make the middleware a no-op so reverse-proxy / remote-host
    deployments are never redirected.

    *holds_every_family* answers, at REDIRECT time, whether this gateway holds
    every loopback family the destination name can resolve to. It gates the same
    rule the local-token mint follows, for the same reason: an ambiguous name
    names a SET of listeners, and a 302 onto it is a credential send, because the
    browser follows it carrying the host-only ``Lax`` session cookie on exactly
    the top-level navigation this middleware converts. ``?token=`` in the query
    is refused separately and is not the only credential in play.

    A destination this gateway does not fully hold therefore gets NO redirect: the
    document stays on the literal it dialled, which this gateway does hold. The
    cost is the split-localStorage annoyance the redirect exists to avoid, paid
    only while a family is uncovered -- and the most common reason it is uncovered
    is that another process holds that family's port, which is the party the
    redirect would hand the cookie to.

    Omitting the callable keeps the redirect ungated, for callers whose
    *canonical_host* is not an ambiguous name (a literal names one listener) and
    for unit tests of the gating rules themselves.

    Extracted to a module-level factory (rather than an inline closure) so the

    Without this the tunnel is started (``tunnel/setup.py`` → ``TunnelManager.start()``)

    whatever the active ``TunnelProvider`` brought up outlived the gateway — even
    on a clean Ctrl+C. A companion provider that supervises a child process
    leaked it (reparented to PID 1) and the next gateway start collided on the
    same tunnel name. The manager is edition-neutral, so stopping it here tears
    down EVERY provider (the public Default's ``stop()`` is a no-op).

    Registered like the other long-lived subsystems (``_watchdog_shutdown``,
    ``_register_instances_hooks``): the hook is appended BEFORE ``runner.setup()``
    freezes the app's signal lists, and reads ``state.tunnel_manager`` lazily —
    the manager is only assigned later, after ``setup_tunnel`` runs, and this
    hook fires at shutdown, long after that assignment. That lazy read is also
    what lets the REGISTRATION sit first in ``start_dashboard``: ``on_cleanup``
    handlers are dispatched in registration order under a hard shutdown
    deadline, so a tunnel hook queued behind the other subsystems can be starved
    (instances cleanup waiting on SSH children that ignore SIGTERM eats the
    deadline, the gateway force-exits, and the tunnel is never stopped).

    Two teardown paths, because a live tunnel does not imply a manager:
    ``setup_tunnel`` builds a ``TunnelManager`` and the hook stops that, but the
    on-demand link path (``slack.use_tunnel_url`` →
    ``current_context().tunnel.ensure_available()`` in ``slack/allowlist.py``)
    provisions and starts a tunnel straight on the provider and never constructs
    a manager. With ``state.tunnel_manager`` still None, bailing out left exactly
    the orphan this hook exists to prevent, so the no-manager path stops
    ``current_context().tunnel`` directly. Only one path runs per shutdown — the
    manager delegates to the same provider — so nothing is stopped twice.

    Failure containment: ``on_cleanup`` handlers run in sequence and a raise
    aborts the remaining ones, so a tunnel teardown must never propagate. BOTH
    paths go through ``_stop_bounded``: the stop is bounded by
    ``_TUNNEL_STOP_TIMEOUT_SECS`` and every exception is logged and swallowed, so
    neither a hanging nor a raising provider — nor a fail-closed
    ``current_context()`` — can block or crash the rest of gateway shutdown.
    ``TunnelManager.stop()`` is itself idempotent (it re-delegates and, on
    failure, simply declines to pin STOPPED) and a provider ``stop()`` is
    expected to be too, so a shutdown path that runs twice is harmless on either
    path.

      still serving its primary listener would turn a degradation into an outage.

    **Why this exists.** Prewarming was triggered only by the browser's pointer-down
    on the microphone, which is too late to help: the digest verification and the
    native load sit in front of the first utterance's own decode, so a user who says
    a short phrase and stops is still waiting on them after they have finished
    speaking. Paying them at boot, when nobody is waiting, removes them from the
    first utterance -- and the context is then resident for every later one, so the
    cost lands once per gateway rather than once per cold start.

    **What it does and does not save.** It removes the hash and the load, NOT the
    decode, which has to happen either way. Measured on a 32-core aarch64 CPU build
    (11 s clip, time from "ready to decode" to "transcript in hand"): ``base``
    1.36 s -> 0.66 s, ``small`` 4.39 s -> 2.44 s, ``large-v3-turbo`` 15.47 s ->
    13.59 s. So the saving is 0.7-2.0 s here, and is dominated by the digest check,
    which scales with model size and with how cold the page cache is -- the same
    1.6 GB model hashed in 1.14 s warm and 5.48 s cold, so the upper bound on a cold
    host is several seconds. The first decode's graph allocation, by contrast, is
    negligible on a CPU build: 30-40 ms, measured as the gap between the first and
    second decode after a load.

    **What it deliberately does not do.**

    * It never FETCHES A MODEL THE HOST DOES NOT HAVE. Only an already-present model
      is warmed, checked with ``is_present`` before the engine is asked for anything.
      A gateway that pulls 1.6 GB because it booted would be spending a user's
      bandwidth on a feature they have not used yet, and the first-run download stays
      where it is: an explicit ``POST /api/stt/prepare``.

      Not quite "never downloads", and the gap is worth stating: ``is_present`` is a
      stat, while the load path's ``ensure`` verifies the file against its pinned
      digest. A present-but-corrupt file therefore does re-download here -- a repair,
      not a first fetch, and the alternative would be warming a model whose bytes
      are not the ones we pinned.
    * It never touches the microphone. This is model residency only.
    * It does not block boot, and it does not run on the event loop: the same two
      costs ``_stt_idle_sweep`` documents apply identically here, and the load itself
      goes to the STT executor inside ``prewarm``.
    * It does not fail anything. A missing model, an unavailable recogniser or a
      failed warm decode all leave the gateway exactly as it was -- the next real
      session prepares on its own behalf and reports its own errors.

    Cancelled at shutdown like the sweep. A cancel during the native load cannot stop
    it (there is no abort hook for a load), which is why the work is a plain
    ``await`` on ``prewarm`` rather than something that pretends otherwise: the
    engine's own ``_load_future`` bookkeeping is what keeps a second load from
    starting alongside one that outlived its caller.
