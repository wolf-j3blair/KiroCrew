    A record is not worth turning an injection or a binding into a failure, and the
    paths that reach here are reached in tests by state DOUBLES that model a slot store
    and nothing else -- so a missing attribute is an ordinary input rather than a bug.
    What makes swallowing safe is the far end: the append is handed to the crew log's
    writer without waiting, a write the writer permanently loses is itself recorded, and
    the class fold reads a dropped write as a hole. A lost record therefore costs a
    cross-session read a refusal, never a silent grant.

    A slot with NO OPEN LOG is the one case that argument does not cover, because nothing
    is handed to the writer at all and so nothing records the loss. It is reachable: an
    idle session can be bound to a channel, route a turn, and be unbound again before its
    first turn opens a log, and a class read from the live slot at that point states
    never-published about a log that holds channel-authored words. So a restriction is
    MARKED on the slot instead of dropped, and the shared derivation folds the mark in
    when the log is finally opened.

    The mark is written BEFORE the append is attempted and is NOT conditioned on it,
    because a session id is not evidence that a log exists: a restored session publishes
    its id while its log is still absent, and the append then finds no log and returns
    having written nothing and recorded no loss. Keying the mark on the restriction itself
    rather than on a prediction about the append covers that ordering and every other
    reason an append can fail to land, including ones not enumerated here. The cost is a
    mark that outlives an append that DID land, which only re-states a restriction the log
    already carries: the fold holds each member at the most restrictive value the log ever
    recorded, so a redundant mark changes no answer.

    """Give every slot row its ``parent`` -- ``{slot, key}`` or ``None``. IN PLACE.

    This is what lets the chat sidebar nest a session under the one that opened it
    through ``session_create``: the sidebar already receives the slots broadcast, so
    the edge rides a frame it gets anyway rather than a route it would have to poll.

    The SHAPE is byte-identical to the Sessions table's ``parent`` -- same two keys,
    same meaning, same ``key: None`` for a creator that is not running or sits on a
    cycle -- because one moved ``nestsUnder`` serves both views and a second shape
    would be a second way to nest the same gateway. What differs, necessarily, is the
    KEY SPACE: ``key`` names the creator's row IN THIS PAYLOAD, so here it is the bare
    slot key and on the memory payload it is the full ``dashboard:`` session key.
    ``nestsUnder`` resolves ``parent.key`` against its own payload's keys, so that is
    the invariant it needs; a session key here would name no row and every child would
    silently detach.

    Whole-population work, so it lives after the per-slot loop rather than inside
    :meth:`DashboardState.serialize_slot`: resolving a citation to a LIVE creator needs
    every row's key, which one slot does not have.

    NO DISK, and no blocking, because this runs on the event loop. The lineage is read
    only when the projection is ALREADY seeded for the store now configured; otherwise
    every row ships ``parent: None`` for this frame and the seed is handed to the
    maintenance pool. Seeding is a checkpoint load plus a names-only listing, or on the
    very first boot of this build one full scan -- work measured in milliseconds but
    still disk, and disk on this loop stalls every other request and the heartbeat
    behind it.

    The seed landing does not broadcast a slots frame. Every path that would --
    ``push_slots_update``, the trailing timer -- writes the coalescer's clock, and that
    is load-bearing elsewhere: a request inside ``suspend_slots_push`` needs that window
    open so its own flush broadcasts INLINE and a broadcast failure reaches its caller,
    and the create path pins exactly one coalesced frame per change.

    Instead the frame SAYS it is provisional: while the projection is not seeded for this
    store, every row carries ``lineage_pending: true``. When the seed lands, the
    projection announces it on the crew-log bus and :meth:`DashboardState.push_lineage_patch`
    sends the settled rows as a ``slot_patch`` -- a frame outside the coalescer -- so an
    IDLE gateway, where no other frame is coming, still nests without a client asking
    again. The flag is set only when a later answer would genuinely differ -- never with
    the crew log off, and never after a failure this cannot promise will clear.

    Nor is the seed started at boot, which would close that one-frame window: seeding is
    bound to one store and re-runs when the data home changes, so a process serving
    several homes would queue a full cold scan per bind onto the shared maintenance pool.

    *resolve_aliases* answers ``DashboardState.spend_slot_by_session()`` -- session key
    to slot key -- and it is the SAME correspondence the Sessions table's payload hands
    the same join. It is what carries the spellings this payload's own keys do not: a
    conductor whose turns run on a channel conversation is cited by that channel key, and
    a dashboard session can be cited by its ``dashboard:`` spelling, neither of which is a
    slot key. Without it the join answered "creator not running" for exactly those
    conductors while the Sessions table nested their workers from the same fold, and the
    two views disagreed about one gateway at one moment.

    It is a CALLABLE rather than the mapping itself so the read happens inside this
    function's own failure boundary. A fault while resolving it is a fault in the
    nesting, and the paragraph below is what the whole path owes such a fault: unnested
    rows plus one WARNING carrying the traceback. Reading it at the call site instead
    would put that one fault outside the boundary and take the entire sidebar down with
    it. ``None`` is accepted so a caller with no registry to ask still gets every row's
    key, and a value that is not a mapping is discarded the same way -- a state double's
    attribute call can answer with another mock.

    Never raises, and every row gets the key either way. A sidebar that cannot paint is
    a worse failure than a sidebar that does not nest, and a row silently MISSING the
    key would make the frontend's ``parent === undefined`` mean two different things.

    A failure IS reported, once per process at WARNING with its traceback, because it is
    the only outcome this leaves no evidence of: the payload it produces is
    byte-identical to a store that genuinely holds no lineage, so without the line a
    missing conductor lane cannot be told from a gateway with nothing to nest.

      passes ``True`` and lets the gate decide per socket.
    * The SSE queue does NOT. ``_broadcast()`` fans the raw note out to every
      registered queue with no per-app filtering, so ``api_stream`` must make
      the decision itself and passes ``include_metadata`` only for a

    unfiltered queue exposes it to any app token granted that route regardless
    of its ``slots:*`` scope — the same class as leaking public-repo status onto
    ``/api/stream`` by enriching a payload that feeds both doors. Keep enrichment
    on the door that filters.

    ``cls``/``meta`` are conditional in BOTH directions when included: carried
    when the note has them (``meta.mid`` is the per-row delivery identity a
    client dedups on, so a frame without it cannot be recognised as a

    mid-turn leaves exactly this), or the last conversational row is the
    ASSISTANT's but an error row follows it (the turn streamed partway then died,
    which is otherwise shape-identical to a clean completion). An inject counts
    as an opener only when it carries a dispatching ``meta.injectKind`` (see
    ``_TURN_INJECT_KINDS``): a queued continuation, a recovery or a synthesis
    turn IS a turn, and without it the scan walks past an interrupted one and
    can reach the previous turn's Stop card, which then hides the newer
    interruption. An untagged inject -- a ``/note`` breadcrumb, a Stop-hook halt
    card, a refusal notice -- dispatched nothing and is looked through.

    Two shapes are explicitly excluded. A trailing ``stop_event``: the user
    pressing Stop is a deliberate ending, not an interruption, and stopping
    before the reply emitted any text produces the same ``[user, ...]`` tail as
    a crash. And a ``/compact`` request answered by its compaction notice (the

    ``meta.kind="compaction"``): the slash command IS the whole request and the
    notice IS its result, so nothing is missing. The discriminator is
    deliberately BOTH halves -- the tag alone cannot decide, because an
    automatic compaction can write the same tagged row inside an ordinary turn
    whose real reply never arrived, and that tail is a genuine interruption.

    Selects the wording injected for the model (``_MANUAL_RESUME_MSG`` vs
    ``_MANUAL_CONTINUE_MSG``), gates whether the composer offers the Resume
    control (the ``continuable && interrupted`` composition in
    ``website/src/pages/ChatPage.tsx``), and feeds the ``interrupted`` field of
    the slot summary so the sidebar can stop rendering a goal loop as actively
    working while its session sits behind a Resume button. A False result means
    "as far as the transcript shows, the last turn finished or was ended on
    purpose", NOT "there is nothing to do": a force-quit runs no ``finally``, so
    the error row that would have proved an interruption was never written.

    Mirrors ``selectTurnInterrupted`` in ``website/src/store/chat/selectors.ts`` —
    the two must agree, or the composer promises one thing and the agent is
    told another.

    Deliberately does not distinguish "produced some output" from "produced

    Returns False (skip recovery) when:
    - No refusals occurred
    - A session reset is already re-queuing
    - The user stopped the turn (``user_stopped``: a stop still in flight, or
      one that pressed and resolved during the turn)
    - Every refusal was already explained IN-BAND and the backend confirmed it

    ``user_stopped`` is the host's own Stop signal, read LIVE at the call: a stop
    in flight (``slot._stopping``), ``slot._stop_generation`` moved since the
    turn began, or the session manager's stop count for the turn's session key
    moved (a stop issued from a linked channel surface). It is the only
    user-cancel input this gate takes; the backend's wire ``stopReason`` is
    deliberately not one. The two are not the same thing: codex-acp's command
    approval advertises ``cancel`` as its ONLY reject option (measured on
    codex-acp 1.11.0 / codex 0.153.4 -- there is no ``decline``), and codex
    answers that reject by aborting the whole turn with ``stopReason:
    "cancelled"`` before the model is called again. A gate that read that stop
    reason as a Stop press skipped this continuation on every policy block, and
    on codex this continuation is the only channel that reaches the model (the
    turn itself is gone, so no in-band notice can). A backend abort with
    refusals recorded and no Stop pressed is the refusal's own consequence, and
    the continuation is exactly what is owed.

    The parameter is keyword-only and REQUIRED so no caller can reintroduce a
    stop-reason rule by omission. Callers must read it at the gate, not from a
    snapshot taken before an await: a Stop that presses and resolves during an
    awaited Stop hook leaves ``slot._stopping`` False again, and only the
    generation counters still say it happened. The in-flight stop is part of
    that signal rather than a parameter of its own, so a caller cannot pass a
    stale in-flight read next to a live one.

    ``notices_sent`` is how many :func:`build_refusal_steer_notice` bodies were
    steered into the turn, and ``notices_pending`` how many of those the
    ``steering_consumed`` echo did NOT account for. The extra turn is skipped only
    when every refusal got a notice AND none is still pending -- an unconfirmed
    steer is treated as undelivered, so the fallback continuation still runs. The
    check is deliberately coarse (counts, not a per-refusal pairing): its two
    failure directions are not symmetric. Skipping wrongly leaves the model with
    kiro-cli's "User denied tool execution" and no correction, while queueing
    wrongly costs one turn the model would otherwise have been told twice --
    which is exactly what this path already cost before in-band delivery
    existed. Both keep defaults so a caller on a harness without mid-turn steer
    behaves as if nothing was steered.

    """Build the body of an automatic continuation after a recoverable tool refusal.

    When a tool call is refused for a recoverable, system-side reason — a
    host-gate policy deny, the read-only bash safety gate, or a PreToolUse policy
    hook block — the reason reaches the dashboard pill and the SEL audit log but
    never the model: kiro-cli's own tool result for a rejected permission is the
    fixed string "User denied tool execution", which is indistinguishable from a
    human having clicked No. So the agent apologises for a cancellation that
    never happened and yields.

    This continuation is the FALLBACK path. The primary path is
    :func:`build_refusal_steer_notice`, which delivers the same reason in-band on
    a harness that supports mid-turn steer, costing no extra turn. This one runs
    when that was impossible (harness without steer) or when the steer was never
    folded in (no ``steering_consumed`` echo covered it).

    ``refusals`` is a list of ``(tool_title, reason)`` tuples recorded during the
    turn (already redacted by the caller). The returned text hands those reasons
    back to the model and frames the block as a system policy decision — NOT a
    user cancellation — so the agent can adapt (an allowed alternative, a
    different tool) or stop on its own with a reason. The caller prepends
    :data:`REFUSAL_RECOVERY_PREFIX`. Returns "" if there is nothing to recover.

    ``answered`` says the turn ALREADY streamed text the user has read, despite
    the block. The premise of the default wording — "the turn ended early, pick up
    where you left off" — is then false, and acting on it makes the model re-answer
    a question the user has already read, once per blocked call and at full turn
    cost. So the body flips to awareness-only: same block reasons, same
    remediation, but an explicit instruction not to restate what was sent.

    That flag deliberately does NOT claim the turn *finished* — no caller can tell
    a delivered answer from a one-line preamble ("Let me check the logs.") before
    the blocked call, because the two are indistinguishable prose flushed at the
    same point in the stream. So this branch conditions its instruction on whether
    the task is done rather than asserting it: continue-from-there is the default
    and stopping is the narrow case. Asserting a finished answer here would tell a
    turn that had only narrated its intent to stop with the work undone.
    The reason still has to be delivered rather than dropped, because on a backend
    without mid-turn steer this turn is the ONLY channel for it — without it the
    model's last word on the subject is kiro-cli's "User denied tool execution",
    and it will keep attributing the block to the user in later turns.

    ``turn_aborted`` says the backend ended the blocked turn as CANCELLED rather
    than letting it run on -- codex, whose only reject option aborts the turn.
    Codex then tells the model, in its own words, that the turn was interrupted
    ("aborted by user" on the tool result, a ``<turn_aborted>`` note saying the
    user interrupted on purpose). Those words are wrong here and they arrive
    right next to this continuation, so the body has to name and overrule them
    explicitly; the generic "not a user action" sentence alone loses to two
    harness-authored messages saying the opposite.

    Lives here (a leaf module that owns the prefix) rather than in context.py so
    chat_runner can import it at module top without a circular import. There is
    deliberately no retry cap: the model decides when to stop, and the user's
    Stop button remains the hard breaker.

    HAS one that could not be determined, so the log is a chain BREAK -- a later
    fold may pass over a chain start when ranking, and must refuse on a break rather

        Called by every site that is about to ALLOCATE a session for this slot,

        write is conditional on the latch being empty, and that is the whole
        point: the eager prefetch and the first real turn both allocate, and by
        the time the turn runs the prefetch has already mapped the successor, so a
        second observation names the successor rather than an earlier store.
        Keeping the FIRST observation keeps the predecessor a `session/opened` can
        cite, and an empty ``sid`` latches nothing rather than latching a store
        with no name.

        ``sid`` is what the slot's MAPPING answers, and the mapping is a proxy for
        this question rather than its authority. An allocation whose history replay
        is pending keeps the prior resumable id there deliberately, so that the id
        a restart can resume stays durable -- and for that window the mapping names
        a generation OLDER than the newest store this slot wrote. Latching it makes
        two successive stores cite one predecessor and leaves the store between

        * ``_app`` is set only by an app creating the slot (App Kit §5.2), is
          persisted in the session metadata, and is already the ownership axis
          every other isolation decision in these files keys on. A session a

          which is what keeps interactive behaviour byte-identical.

        Both halves are persisted, and they have to be: ``_app`` surviving a
        restart while ``_human_seen`` did not is what made an attended app tab

        The three views the broadcast ships differ ONLY in each slot's
        ``source_links`` field -- the audience gates are read nowhere else in the
        summary (see ``_ChatSlot.source_links_view``). Serializing the list three

        budgeting three times for identical output, synchronously on the

        A report describes exactly ONE session. Clearing it at each teardown was
        the wrong shape — review found path after path that skipped it (the reset
        funnel, the reload and reset-conversation routes, the queued discard, a
        channel handler, the cron reaper, the task runner, a project change) — and
        a LIVENESS check ("does a session exist?") still missed the last of them,
        because a reset RECREATES a session under the same key: the slot looked
        alive while the report described the session that had gone.

        So the question asked here is identity, not liveness — is the live session
        the one this payload was taken under? A mismatch is dropped by
        construction, which closes every one of those paths at once, including any
        future one, and demotes the remaining ``clear_mcp_report()`` calls to a
        courtesy that pushes the delta early rather than the thing correctness
        rests on.

        Validating HERE cannot be bypassed: this is the single projector both
        ``/api/chat/slots`` and the WebSocket snapshot go through.

        The key derivation mirrors ``chat_utils.effective_session_key`` — a
        channel-born slot's turns run on the channel's own session — and is
        inlined because ``chat_utils`` imports this module. One refinement over
        that mirror: an in-flight turn's OWN key wins over the slot's routing.
        The two diverge when the routing is reassigned on a live slot — a cron
        injection binds ``linked_session_key`` to ``cron:<id>`` with no
        ``running`` gate — and the report describes the session the turn is
        actually running on, not the one a FUTURE turn would route to.
        Resolving the routing there reads a different (or absent) provider,
        mismatches, and clears a live session's report mid-turn. Same rule as
        turn cancellation: address the turn, not the routing.

    The single acceptance test for a notification row, shared by the loader and by the
    append-time trim so the two cannot drift apart. A line the loader would skip must
    not occupy a slot in the trim's live window: it would displace a servable row, and
    the rewrite that follows deletes that row permanently.

    Parsing to a JSON object is not sufficient on its own. ``normalize_note`` raises
    for an object whose ``channel`` is unhashable, so such a row parses here and is
    still unservable, and a trim that asked only ``isinstance(row, dict)`` would count
    it as live history.

    Redaction is part of acceptance rather than the caller's job, for two reasons. Rows
    written before delivery-time redaction existed may carry unredacted LLM-derived
    content and are served to SSE clients straight from the loader's list; and the
    redactor is one of the two steps that can reject a row, so leaving it out of the
    test would reopen the divergence this function closes.

    The note is normalized and redacted in place. A caller that writes the file back
    writes the ORIGINAL bytes, never this dict, so nothing here migrates what is on
    disk.

    Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped HERE rather than by a caller, because
    ``str.strip()`` removes whitespace ``json`` does not accept -- a no-break space, for
    one -- so a caller that strips and a caller that does not reach opposite verdicts on
    the same row. This stripping decides only whether a row can be served; it never
    reaches disk, so it is not the stripping hazard the snapshot dedupe key avoids,
    where a stripped key makes two distinct byte sequences collide and deletes one.

    older LIVE rows, permanently losing history after the next load-time
    sweep.

    The recency cap counts only LIVE lines: a line ``_servable_note`` accepts and this
    sweep does not find expired, which is exactly what ``_load_notifications`` goes on
    to serve. Both paths ask that one predicate, so the trim cannot come to disagree
    with the loader about what counts as history. An UNSERVABLE line, one the predicate
    rejects, is still kept, because destroying a line on ambiguity is worse than
    holding one nobody can read. It is kept in a separate, smaller window so that it
    cannot displace a live notification.

    Two windows rather than one, because one shared window turns an append into an
    eviction. An unservable line has no dedupe key, so a merge appends it instead of
    collapsing it, which puts it among the NEWEST lines; a single newest-N window over
    the combined list then discards valid older notifications in its favour, and the
    rule meant to avoid destroying data is what destroys it. Neither the framing that
    produces unparseable fragments nor the withheld dedupe key is the thing to change:
    both are deliberate, and both are what stop a fragment being skipped as a false
    duplicate and its bytes lost.

    Retained lines keep their original file order AND their exact bytes, terminator
    included, so a fragment stays beside the neighbours that explain it, a final line
    with no terminator stays final instead of gluing onto the row written after it, and
    a CRLF or bare-CR row still matches the raw dedupe key its source record carries.
