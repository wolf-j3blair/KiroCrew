"""Session control: letting one chat session observe and interrupt another.

Four operations — create a session, stop its turn, close (archive) it, and read
its transcript — plus the authorization that decides whether a caller may address
a target at all. The operations are deliberately thin: they reuse the same
creation, stop, close and history paths the dashboard itself uses, so a controlled
session behaves exactly like one a human is typing into.

**Two verbs here write into another session's conversation: ``session_send`` and
``session_broadcast``.**
Reading returns a transcript tail; stopping cancels an in-flight turn the way the
Stop button does; closing archives the session the way the tab ✕ does (the
conversation is saved to history and can be reopened — closing is not deletion);
creating opens an empty session in the user's sidebar; sending
delivers a message the target runs as its next turn, redacted through
``sanitize_outbound`` and prefixed with a ``[sent by session … via <verb>]``
envelope so it can never render as something the person typed — and the verb is
named in it, so a worker can tell a message addressed to it alone from one every
sibling also received. Broadcasting is not a second write path: it resolves an
audience and hands each target to the same delivery, so every bound below holds
per target unchanged. An IDLE target runs
it under the authorization that admitted it; a BUSY target queues it, and the
generic drain re-asserts the target-side containment before the entry becomes a
turn: producers stamp the constraints that held at admission
(:func:`containment_meta`), and ``chat_runner``'s drain drops — with a visible
notice and an SEL record — any entry for which a constraint holds at delivery
that did not hold at admission. A dropped CROSS-SESSION delivery is reported back
to its sender too, since the target's own notice is on a transcript the sender
does not read: the entry also carries the sending session, as a slot key plus
that slot's tab identity (:func:`send_origin_meta`), and the drop appends a
notice there (:func:`notify_send_origin_dropped`). A human-typed queued message
shares the same window and the same re-check, and carries no sender to report to.

Authorization is deny-by-default and checked in one place
(:func:`authorize_target`) for the three operations that take a target — stop,
close and read — so a guard cannot be present on one verb and missing on another.
``session_create`` has no target; it checks the caller's own eligibility with the
same refusals.

    instead is ownership: :func:`authorize_target` restricts a member caller to
    slots it created itself, so the automatic grant never reaches the user's
    own sessions.

    * (a) a pinned DM slot, keyed ``member-<slug>`` — recognised by the members

      :func:`_store_is_member_owned` reads off the config record.

    Case (b) needs the caller's slot to read its bound store, hence *state*;
    ``member_dispatch`` gates the bypass either way (:func:`_member_bypass`).

    This predicate decides the switch BYPASS, re-read live at every gate so a

    The ONE predicate that recognises a member store, shared by the HTTP gate

    switch bypass here (:func:`_member_caller` case (b)), so the two layers cannot
    disagree on what a member store is. It answers from the CONFIG RECORD, never
    the on-disk ownership manifest: it runs at :func:`authorize_target`'s
    synchronous gate, where a manifest ``stat`` / ``read`` would be blocking IO on
    the event loop. ``KiroCrewConfig.load()`` is the cached read the switch gate
    beside it already performs (warmed by :func:`prewarm_enabled_check`), and the
    fields it reads are in-memory attributes of the loaded record.

    ``True`` requires ALL of: a record for *store*; ``memory_version == 2``; a
    non-empty ``owner_member``; and that owner still an ACTIVE agent bound to
    exactly this store (the live-binding test ``active_member_memory_stores``
    applies). A crew can be deleted while a chat slot bound to its store is still
    live — the store record is retained with ``owner_member`` set but the agent is
    gone from ``cfg.agents`` — and a retired owner must not keep the switch bypass
    past a governance switch the operator turned off.

    Everything else is ``False``, and every ``False`` is FAIL-CLOSED for what this
    predicate decides — admission and the switch bypass: ``default``/empty, a
    missing record, a non-V2 store, an ownerless V2 store, a retired or re-bound

    withhold member status, and a caller then falls back under the global switch
    like any other. Withdrawing the case-(b) admission can never open the surface
    wider than it is.

    It is deliberately NOT the ownership FENCE's source of truth. The record is
    mutable — an operator's own config writer can un-assign the member, drop
    ``memory_version`` (the loader coerces a missing key to ``1``), or drop the
    entry outright — and any of those can land between the HTTP gate's admission
    and the inner authorization. The fence therefore does not re-derive member
    status from this record: the gate carries its VERIFIED admission into
    :func:`authorize_target` as ``precomputed_ownership_fenced`` (see

      the admission keeps the fence readable without the transport roster or the

      otherwise get an unfenced deputy for free: create a child, seed it, and the
      child -- an ordinary caller by key -- reads any same-workspace session and
      reports back through the transcript its creator is allowed to read. The
      fence has to follow authority, not spelling.

    ``_created_by`` is the marker for that last population and needs no lineage
    walk: :func:`create_session` is its ONLY writer (a person's own tab and a fork
    reach ``get_or_create_slot`` directly and stay unattributed), so a non-empty
    value means "an agent made this session" at any depth. An agent-created

    decided at that gate (see :func:`_delegation_lineage_fenced`), not here, so
    this predicate's containment of every agent-created session stays intact.

    There is deliberately NO attendance exemption. ``_ChatSlot._human_seen`` looks
    like the right hatch and is not: it records that a human has EVER driven the
    slot, is monotonic and persisted, and says nothing about who authored the turn
    running now. Releasing the fence on it would hand the creator its deputy back
    for the price of the user glancing at the tab once -- cron creates the child,
    the user types into it, and from then on every cron-authored turn in that child
    runs unfenced. The question this predicate can answer is "whose authority is
    this session", not "is a person at the keyboard", so a person working in an

    An app-scoped SESSION is refused by the ``_app`` check that sits beside every
    call site of this one, but a cron tab does not carry that tag:
    ``inject_cron_result_to_dashboard`` mints it without ``app=``, so an app's own
    scheduled job reaches this surface with ``_app == ""`` and would pass. Left
    unchecked, an app could create a persistent, sidebar-visible session that is
    NOT app-scoped -- precisely the confinement escape the ``_app`` refusal exists
    to prevent, reached through the app's scheduled job instead of its session.

    App ownership therefore has to be read from the JOB, and it has TWO spellings
    there because two writers record it differently: the app cron SDK tags
    ``created_by = "app:{app_name}"``, while ``mcp_cron``'s own ``cron_add``
    records the calling session in ``session_key`` and never writes ``created_by``
    at all -- so an app-scoped session's job carries its authority only in the
    second. Both are checked, and the second delegates to ``_app`` on the owning
    slot rather than re-deriving app-ness, so there is one definition of "is this
    an app" and not a third. **A new field on the job that can name a principal is
    a hole here until it is added to this function.**

    Fail-CLOSED when ``session_key`` names a closed session: its
    ``_app`` cannot be read, and "could not verify the owner is not an app" must
    not read as "has no owner". ``mcp_cron``'s ``cron_add`` records an app's
    authority ONLY in ``session_key`` -- so once that slot is gone, allowing the
    job would let an app escape confinement through a cron it authored and then
    abandoned by closing its session. The cost is a genuinely user-created
    dispatching cron whose authoring tab has closed is refused too; that caller
    can reopen a tab, whereas an app session minted outside its confinement cannot
    be undone. This is the same fail-closed direction the missing-job case below
    takes, and what still bounds the app case beyond it is that a LIVE app session
    has its jobs refused directly by the ``_app`` read.

    Fail-CLOSED on a job that cannot be found, or a registry that cannot answer:
    "could not verify the owner" must not read as "has no owner", the same
    direction ``agent_unverifiable`` takes on its own unreadable input. Nothing

    the caller reads in its own channel. In order:

    * *slot* is channel-born: its ``linked_session_key`` is a channel key (a cron
      tab's link is not, see ``CRON_LINK_PREFIX``). A dashboard-born slot is not
      this predicate's subject even when it mirrors to a DM -- its own
      conversation is the dashboard, and the mirror refusal keeps judging it.
    * The key parses under the canonical grammar as a DIRECT conversation with
      exactly one peer, on a surface in :data:`OWNER_DM_CONDUCTOR_SURFACES`. A
      thread, group or forum key names a wider audience; a ``unified`` bucket
      names no peer; the legacy two-segment Slack shape does not parse; a surface
      not verified for this fails closed by construction.
    * The channel's LIVE transport names exactly one owner and it is that peer:
      :func:`~kiro_crew.messaging.transport.sole_direct_target` over
      ``configured_targets()``, the same one-identity rule ``/sessions`` and the
      proactive owner DM apply, and the same reasoning -- an allow-list is a list
      of people permitted to talk to the agent, not a claim that any of them is
      the operator, so several entries name nobody. Read off the transport rather
      than the config record because it is the roster in force NOW (reloaded live,
      the very set that admits the peer's turns) and an in-memory read, which
      keeps this callable from ``close_target``'s no-suspension re-check. An
      absent transport means the channel is not running, and a session nobody can
      drive is not admitted on the strength of a stale key.
    * The outbound mirror, if any, IS the conversation the session lives in. The
      dispatcher binds the DM as its own mirror on every turn, and that mirror is
      the same audience -- but the dashboard can retarget a mirror at any thread
      or channel, and a retargeted DM republishes what it reads to people who
      are not the owner. So the mirror must equal the ORIGIN conversation the
      dispatcher recorded (``SessionManager.get_origin_link``, written on every
      inbound turn beside the mirror bind); an unknown origin, an unreadable
      store or a mirror that names anywhere else refuses. Compared as a whole
      :class:`ChannelLink` because the DM channel id is not the peer id on every
      surface (Discord's is the id ``create_dm_channel`` returned), so no
      derivation from the key could stand in for the recorded truth. An
      UNLINKED DM reads ``None`` here and is admitted: the dispatcher's first
      turn stamps the conversation's namespaced bucket into the legacy
      ``slack_channel_id`` field and ``clear_mirror_link`` pops only the
      ``mirror`` row, so ``!unlink`` / ``/unlink`` and the dashboard's
      mirror-unlink leave a threadless Slack row behind -- and
      ``SessionMap.get_mirror_link`` filters that row at the source (an empty
      ``thread_ts`` never enters Slack's thread index, so it is bookkeeping that
      names no audience) rather than handing every reader a Slack link nobody
      chose. This clause therefore carries no copy of that rule, and neither does
      ``bind_origin_mirror``. The converse row is a second audience the mirror
      read CANNOT see: ``get_mirror_link``
      returns the explicit ``mirror`` row whenever one exists and never looks at
      the Slack fields beside it, while the dashboard's slack-link writes its
      thread onto the slot's effective key -- this session, for a channel-born
      slot (``DashboardState.link_slack``) -- and the turn path posts every
      dashboard-driven reply into that thread straight off ``get_slack_link``.
      So the thread is read through ``get_slack_link`` as well, and a non-empty
      ``thread_ts`` refuses: the DM's mirror still equals its origin, and the
      Slack thread is a room full of people who are not the owner.

    What this deliberately does NOT establish is unfenced reach: an admitted DM is
    creator-fenced by :func:`_caller_is_ownership_fenced`, so a wrong inference
    costs the sessions the DM created and never the person's own tabs. Group and
    thread sessions, every other channel, and ``channel.CHANNEL_AGENT_BLOCKED_TOOLS``
    are untouched.

    An absent ``origin_tab`` answers False whenever a slot is found, so a stamp

    Returns whether a notice was SCHEDULED: True once the entry carries a channel
    stamp and the task below exists. Answers False, and is not a failure, when the
    entry carries no stamp (a dashboard-typed or restored entry) or when no loop
    is running to carry the task. Whether the notice is then SENT is decided
    inside the task, and its refusals are logged and audited there.

    The send goes through the cross-surface ladder every proactive channel
    delivery takes (``chat_runner._resolve_channel_target``: channels governance,
    a registered transport that can send proactively, and the RECIPIENT
    re-check), with the principal the stamp recorded -- the platform user the
    channel authorized on inbound -- because a dashboard session key names no
    channel peer for the ladder to derive one from. A revoked recipient gets no
    notice; the refusal is audited by the ladder. The mirror pause is NOT
    consulted: this is a delivery receipt to the message's own author, not turn
    output, and the pause mutes output.

    Nothing of the ladder runs on the calling thread. The drain that drops the
    entry is synchronous on the event loop by contract (no suspension between its
    snapshot and the dequeue), so the send cannot be awaited there -- and the
    ladder's governance vet is the call every other async caller offloads,

    inside the scheduled task: the resolve through ``asyncio.to_thread``, the

    cannot be collected mid-flight. Best-effort throughout: a failure is logged
    and the drop, which is the authorization decision, stands.

    """Open a new session in the caller's workspace, persisted at birth.

    The new slot is an ordinary dashboard session -- it appears in the sidebar, the
    user can read it, type into it and close it -- so this gives a workstream a home
    of its own rather than a private channel the user cannot see. It starts empty:
    the person is the one who types the first message into it.

    The caller's own eligibility is checked against the SAME caller-side refusal
    set `authorize_target` applies (`authorize_target` cannot be reused here:
    there is no target yet), and the child inherits the caller's workspace. Both
    matter because a caller refusal missing here, or a workspace not inherited,
    would hand back a session outside the boundary the other verbs enforce.

    The caller's session POSTURE (``_trust`` / ``_trust_reads``) transfers to the
    child, so a trusted operator's dispatched worker does not stall on a prompt
    nobody is watching -- the posture ``parent_trusted`` already gives a
    ``spawn_run`` subagent. Per-command grants (``_trusted_patterns``) and a
    ``SafetyOverride`` scoped grant (``_trust_scope``) are both deliberately
    excluded, and the transferred value is the one held at allocation time rather
    than at entry, so revoking mid call yields an untrusted child. See the block
    around the assignment.

    ``folder_id`` files the slot as part of creation: it is assigned in
    the same synchronous window that configures the slot, the whole
    allocation-to-persist span runs under ``suspend_slots_push`` so the slot's
    first broadcast frame already shows it filed, and the placement rides in the
    persist-at-birth metadata so it survives a restart. An unknown folder
    refuses the whole create -- nothing exists yet, so refusal loses nothing,
    matching the move path's posture -- and existence is confirmed READ-ONLY
    under the folder-store lock (``read_folders``) before the allocation; the
    Model-B un-hide runs only after the filing has landed, so a refused create
    leaves no folder-tree mutation behind. Authorization needs no new path: the
    folder tree cannot be reshaped from here (the id must already exist), and
    every caller class the move path's app-ownership rule exists to stop is
    already refused above it -- an app-scoped caller cannot create a session at
    all (`app_scoped_caller`).

    ``model`` pins the model the child starts on, as the person's own pick in the
    model dropdown would: same rejection guard, same pick-generation bump, and
    recorded in the persist-at-birth metadata so an idle child keeps it across a
    restart. Empty leaves the slot on the agent's or the global default, exactly
    as before. It is not a privilege the caller lacks -- ``spawn_run`` already
    takes a per-run ``model`` -- and it moves no memory boundary.

    ``caller_fenced`` is the ownership-fence verdict the HTTP gate already settled
    on the caller's VERIFIED scope, carried in for the same reason
    ``authorize_target`` takes ``precomputed_ownership_fenced``: the inline
    predicate re-derives member status from the MUTABLE config record, and this
    coroutine suspends many times before it is consulted. ``None`` means "not
    settled", and the fence is then evaluated inline. It is read by the
    private-store authorization below and nothing else.

    ``dry_run`` runs every gate up to the allocation, including the two slot
    ceilings, and returns ``{"dry_run": True}`` instead of minting a slot. It
    spends no rate-limit token and writes nothing. The MCP ``session_create``
    asks it first when its ``folder`` path still has segments to create, so a
    create that would be refused is refused BEFORE any folder exists: without
    it the path walk's folders outlive the refusal as empty sidebar rows.
    ``folder_id`` is then the deepest folder that already exists, which is the
    one the new segments would inherit a project directory from.

    # * the store is the caller's OWN, read from its protected execution record --
    #   the same-store worker that is a private caller's own model. The record is
    #   the only admissible input: `slot.agent` and `slot.memory_store` are
    #   metadata a later write can change, and the SELECTION itself is a
    #   caller-supplied string, so deriving authority from either lets the request
    #   authorize itself by naming a member's agent.
    # * the caller is the owner's own dashboard session, which is what "not
    #   ownership-fenced" means. That is a shipped capability: an owner reopening
    #   member conversations and dispatching member workers. It is preserved here.
    #
    # Refused, therefore, is every population `_caller_is_ownership_fenced`
    # already treats as untrusted for the sessions it may reach: a cron slot, a
    # member's DM slot naming a PEER member's agent, and anything either of them
    # created -- the fenced caller's unfenced deputy the fence exists to catch.
    # An app-token caller never arrives (`_require_internal` refuses it) and an
    # app-scoped one cannot create at all, so the fence is the whole population.
    #
    # Fail-closed in both directions. An unbound caller has no own-store
    # admission, so it needs the unfenced one. A fence verdict is only ever read
    # as a REFUSAL here, so the mutable-record window the carried verdict exists
    # to close can widen nothing: a record that stops saying "member" between the
    # gate and this line turns a refusal into an admission the owner already has,
    # never the reverse.
    #
    # The own-store admission needs TWO sources to agree, and neither alone is
    # enough. `caller_execution` can come from the caller's own transcript record
    # when this process holds no carrier, and that record is written by the very
    # session being judged -- so on its own it answers "whose store is this?" with
    # the subject's own claim. `read_vouched_session_execution` answers with what
    # this process committed, which no session can write, but it can fall behind:
    # several modules publish an execution record without going through
    # `bind_session_execution`, so a legitimate reassignment can leave the vouched
    # entry stale.
    #
    # Requiring agreement fails closed against both. A forged record cannot match
    # a vouched entry it did not write. A stale vouched entry cannot match a record
    # that has moved on. Only an identity this process itself committed, and that
    # the record still carries, admits -- and a caller refused here is not
    # refused outright, it simply falls through to the fence below, which an owner

    # cron's own slot CRON precisely so its output stays out of `slots:user` ("a
    # USER label would expose it to any app holding `slots:user`"), and the trust
    # model states the same rule from the other side: inferring USER for a
    # background caller "put cron output inside `slots:user`". Minting a
    # USER-labelled child would hand a cron the exposure its own slot is denied,
    # by the simple route of creating a session and writing there instead.

    # The tag therefore follows the caller's AUTHORITY, not its key prefix, and

        #   of the grant. The session-store half needs no write here: the child has
        #   no ACP session yet (`set_approval_policy` would silently no-op on a
        #   missing session), and `chat_runner` already assigns the persistable
        #   policy from `_trust` on every session create/resume, so the subagent
        #   spawn gate sees it from the child's first turn.
        # * `_trust_reads` -- the same posture, narrowed to read-only bash. It has
        #   to carry too, or the setting a CAUTIOUS operator picks is the one whose
        #   own workers still stall. Bounded by construction: what it admits has no
        #   side effects, which is what separates it from the command grants below.
        #
        # * `_trusted_patterns` -- NOT inherited. These are per-command grants
        #   ("`npm test` is fine"), not a posture, and the distinction decides it:
        #   a pattern is judged against the session the operator was LOOKING at,
        #   while a dispatched worker runs model-authored work they have not seen,
        #   so the same glob can admit a command the grant was never asked about.
        #   Inheriting them also buys nothing where it would be safe -- with
        #   `_trust` set the child already auto-approves via `_slot_is_trusted`, so
        #   the pattern list is dead weight; it changes the outcome ONLY when the
        #   operator withheld session trust and granted single commands instead,
        #   which is exactly the case that must keep asking. So the child starts
        #   with `_ChatSlot.__init__`'s empty set and earns its own grants.
        # * `_trust_scope` -- NOT inherited. It names a TTL-bounded, SEL-audited
        #   `SafetyOverride` grant that is re-checked on every approval; forking
        #   the key would hand a second session a credential whose revocation

    visible transcript when omitted -- a head fork; tail forks are not offered
    here). The copy is made by the same core the human Fork button runs
    (``chat_fork.fork_slot``), so what the child inherits -- agent, model,
    memory store and mode, project, folder, tags, the ``forked_from`` link --
    is exactly what a person's fork inherits, and for the same memory-boundary
    reasons no override of agent, model or mode is taken here.

    *source* defaults to the CALLER'S OWN session, which is the case this verb
    exists for: an agent splitting its own long investigation into several
    sessions that each start with the context it already built. Naming another
    session is a READ of that session's transcript, so it is authorized exactly
    as ``read_messages`` is (``authorize_target``, operation ``fork``): the
    caller must be allowed to read the source. Either way the caller must also
    be an eligible CREATOR -- the same refusal set ``create_session`` applies,
    because a fork manufactures a session the caller then owns.

    What the child gets on top of the human fork: ``title`` (else the fork's own
    ``Fork of <parent>``), ``folder_id`` (else the parent's folder, as the human
    fork inherits it), creator attribution (``created_by`` = the caller, so the
    other verbs reach it afterwards and the per-creator ceiling counts it) and the
    caller's session posture (``_trust`` / ``_trust_reads`` -- the same two
    fields ``create_session`` carries, with the same exclusions). It starts IDLE:
    the copied transcript is history, and nothing runs until the caller
    ``session_send``\\ s into it or the person types.

    ``caller_fenced`` is the HTTP gate's ownership-fence verdict, forwarded to
    ``authorize_target`` for the reason every other verb forwards it.

    and the config read is the one part of this function that can touch the disk
    on a cache miss. Every containment and identity refusal still runs.

    ``precomputed_ownership_fenced`` is an ownership-fence verdict the caller of
    this function already holds, honoured instead of re-deriving one here. Two
    callers hold one:

    * The HTTP gate (``handlers/session_control.py``'s ``_private_caller_refusal``)
      admits a crew member on its VERIFIED private scope and passes ``True`` down
      through every route. The inline fence (:func:`_caller_is_ownership_fenced`
      → :func:`_member_caller` → :func:`_store_is_member_owned`) re-reads the
      MUTABLE config record, and an operator's own writer can flip that record —
      un-assign the member, drop ``memory_version`` (coerced to ``1`` by the
      loader), drop the entry — in the awaits between the gate and this call. A
      member admitted as one must stay bounded to what it created for the whole
      request, so the verified decision travels with the request rather than
      being recomputed from whatever the record says at the fence.
    * ``close_target`` resolves the verdict ONCE up front (behind
      ``prewarm_enabled_check``) and passes it to both its initial gate and its
      SYNCHRONOUS point-of-no-return re-check, so no ``KiroCrewConfig.load()`` runs
      on the loop inside ``close_slot``'s no-suspension window — the same
      blocking-IO hazard ``skip_enabled_check`` closes for the switch read.

    When ``None`` (an owner or agent-created caller the gate did not admit as a
    member) the fence is evaluated inline as before.

    ``allow_self`` waives the self-target refusal, and with it the ownership fence for
    that one case. Exactly one verb passes it: a release, where the target itself is a
    legitimate caller because a session taken over must not depend on its holder still
    running to get out. It waives nothing else -- an ephemeral, app-scoped or
    channel-linked caller is still refused, and a target that is not the caller is
    still judged by every rule above.

    the store that slot has just replaced. Written into an append-only

    wrong answer this resolver exists to prevent, arriving one hop later.

    Re-reading the slot's own record is enough to close the window because it is the

    """Stop *target*'s in-flight turn, via the same path as the Stop button.

    A stop cancels cooperatively. The button escalates to a hard kill when a
    second press lands while the first is still pending; this verb deliberately
    does not do that for a repeat it cannot tell apart from a RETRY, because a
    client that got no response inside its request timeout re-sends the same
    request, and the kill path discards the target's queue and pending steers. So
    within ``stop_retry.WINDOW_SECS`` of this caller's first stop of this target, a
    repeat returns the existing "stop already in progress" no-op instead. A stop
    arriving after that window still escalates, so a genuine second decision keeps
    the capability — only a blind retry cannot reach it.

    Withholding the escalation never costs the caller the stop it asked for: a
    repeat that finds the target running again soft-stops it as a first call would.

    Still no force flag: escalation is decided by the target's own stop state and
    the window above, never by anything the caller can ask for, so advertising one
    would promise a hard kill a first call cannot deliver.

    ``caller_fenced`` is the ownership-fence verdict the HTTP gate carries for a
    caller it admitted as a crew member (``True``); ``None`` for every other
    caller. Forwarded to :func:`authorize_target` as
    ``precomputed_ownership_fenced`` — see there for why the verified admission
    travels with the request instead of being re-derived from config at the fence.

      a turn in flight, so a self-reload could only ever fail.

    """Deliver *message* to *target* as its next agent turn.

    ``via`` names the VERB in the provenance envelope the target reads. It exists
    because :func:`broadcast_to_targets` delivers through this function, and a
    worker told something every sibling was also told must be able to see that:
    the same sentence means one thing addressed to one session and another
    addressed to eight. It never affects authorization or delivery.

    The delivery path is the same queue-vs-run decision the dashboard composer
    uses (``enqueue_or_run_prompt``): an idle target starts a turn immediately,
    a busy one queues the message for its next turn. Both outcomes are reported
    distinctly — ``started`` says which happened — because "it ran" and "it will
    run later" must not look the same to a caller coordinating several sessions.
    A queued delivery is re-validated at the drain: the entry
    carries the containment that held here, and a constraint newly held at
    delivery time drops it with a visible notice instead of executing it under
    the weaker authorization that admitted it. The entry also carries THIS
    caller's slot, so that drop appends a notice to the caller's own transcript
    as well: ``started: False`` says the message will run later, and a caller
    told only that would otherwise wait for a reply that can never come.

    ``steer`` asks for a THIRD outcome on a busy target: the message cuts into
    the turn already running (``steer_into_running_turn``) instead of waiting for
    it, so a caller watching a worker go the wrong way can say so while the work
    is still in flight rather than after it lands. Reported as ``steered``, its
    own field, for the same reason ``started`` is one.

    Two properties make that arm safe rather than a hole in the queued arm's
    checks. The delivery happening NOW removes the queue's waiting window and
    leaves a narrower one: the steer RPC suspends on ``stdin.drain()``.

    * Containment is re-validated at the queue drain because a queued prompt runs
      later than the moment it was authorized, so the target can gain a channel
      link or an outbound mirror while it waits. Nothing suspends between
      ``authorize_target`` and the steer call, so the text is committed against the
      containment the gate cleared — but the RPC's own suspension is a window, and
      each outcome closes it differently. The fallback re-runs the gate before
      taking the queue arm and refuses a target that resolves to a different slot
      OBJECT. A requeued steer becomes an ordinary queued entry and meets the drain
      unexempted. A SUCCESSFUL steer cannot be recalled, so the admission
      containment is compared against the post-RPC containment and the turn is
      stopped when a constraint newly holds — the reply path resolves its mirror
      live, so a mirror linked mid-turn is a real audience.
    * Provenance is carried by the text, not by the delivery mode: both arms hand
      over the same redacted, envelope-prefixed prompt, so neither the target
      agent nor a person reading the transcript can read an injected message as
      something the human typed. It also travels to the requeue as
      ``user_origin=False``, so a peer's steer does not inherit the composer's
      exemption from the drain's LINKED drop.

    A steer that cannot be injected falls back to the queue — never dropped, and
    the caller is told it queued rather than steered.

    The turn is NOT charged against the background-turn cap, and deliberately so:
    that cap only binds unattended (app-owned) slots, and every target this
    function can authorize is attended — see the comment at the delivery call.

    Two modes, and they are the whole point of the verb being separate from a loop
    of :func:`send_to_target` calls the model writes itself: ``queue`` lets every
    target finish what it is doing, ``steer`` cuts into every running turn. A
    conductor telling eight workers "the base moved, rebase before you push" wants
    the first; one telling them "stop, the issue was already fixed" wants the
    second, and the difference is worth eight turns of latency.

    ``targets`` omitted means :func:`broadcast_audience` — the sessions this caller
    created. Naming them explicitly is for the subset case, and every named target
    goes through the same :func:`authorize_target` gate, so an explicit list can
    only ever be as permissive as one send at a time.

    PARTIAL DELIVERY IS THE NORMAL OUTCOME and the return shape says so per
    target. A target closed between the audience read and its own delivery, one
    that went incognito, one bound to a remote crew: each is one row with its
    refusal ``code``, and the remaining deliveries still happen. The alternative —
    abort on the first refusal — would leave a broadcast half-delivered with
    nothing saying which half, which is the one outcome a caller cannot recover
    from.

    Deliveries are SEQUENTIAL, never gathered. Each one takes the same slot locks,
    runs the same containment re-checks and (for a steer) suspends on an RPC, and
    running them concurrently would interleave those windows across sessions for
    no gain a caller can observe — the report is only read once all of them are
    done either way.

    Which is exactly why each delivery carries its own bound
    (``BROADCAST_TARGET_ALLOWANCE_SECS``): sequential delivery means one target
    that never answers is one target that starves every target behind it, and the
    urgent mode is the one that suspends on an RPC with no ceiling under it. On
    expiry that delivery is cancelled, reported as a ``delivery_timeout`` row, and
    the loop continues. The delivery records ONE marker: that it entered the steer
    await. Cancellation before that marker is provably before hand-over, so
    re-sending is safe. Cancellation once it is set is ambiguous -- inside the
    await or after it returned are indistinguishable here, and a second marker for
    the return would not separate them, because it could only be set once this one
    already was. Both read as unknown and must not invite a retry. The target's
    ``_pending_steers`` and queue
    still add useful information when they retain the exact text, but their shared
    absence cannot reconstruct delivery history. A target whose slot disappeared
    or was replaced also gets an unknown row. None of the rows claims delivery or
    certain execution.

    The DURABLE half of :func:`created_session_status`. ``state._slots`` knows only
    what is open right now, so a worker that was closed, or whose session was lost
    to a crash, disappears from it entirely — and "I dispatched eight and can see
    six" is exactly the question this verb exists to answer. The crew log's session
    tree is written when a session is opened and survives both, so it is what
    supplies the roster while the live slots supply the status.

    The second value is the read's own quality, and it is returned rather than
    folded into the list because the three answers are not interchangeable:

    * ``readable`` — the fold saw every unit the store holds.
    * ``incomplete`` — a unit's bytes could not be read, or the population was
      capped, so rows may be MISSING. The fold is still served: this reader
      DISPLAYS lineage rather than deciding on it, which is the case
      :class:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.session_tree.TreeReading` documents as free to
      ignore the flag — but a caller counting its workers must be told the count
      is a floor.
    * ``unreadable`` — the crew log is off, or the projection is not seeded for the
      store configured now. There is no roster at all and the answer is live-only.

    Reads the in-memory fold and does NO I/O, so it is safe on the event loop. An
    unseeded projection answers ``unreadable`` rather than seeding itself here,
    for the reason :func:`_slot_tree_parent` gives: a seed is a disk read.

    The parent edge it follows is the CURRENT one, so an adopted session is listed
    under whoever holds it now rather than under whoever opened it. That is the
    right answer for this verb — it reports the sessions the caller is answerable
    for — and it cannot widen the caller's reach, because an adoption is itself

    The roster and the status come from THREE sources because none can answer
    every half. The crew log's session tree is durable and gateway-attested, while
    persisted history metadata records a birth before the first turn can write a
    tree edge. Live slots know exactly what is running but forget a session the
    moment it is gone. The union covers all three windows, and each row says which
    source placed it.

    ``status`` per row, and the five are distinct answers a patrol acts on
    differently:

    * ``working`` — a turn is in flight. Wait.
    * ``queued`` — idle, but messages are waiting to run. Also wait, but nothing is
      happening yet, so a steer would land on nothing.
    * ``idle`` — open and doing nothing. This is the one that needs a decision.
    * ``gone`` — the crew log names it and the dashboard does not hold it: closed,
      archived, or lost with the process that ran it. Re-dispatch or drop it; there
      is nothing here to message, and :func:`authorize_target` would answer
      ``target_not_found``.
    * ``unknown`` — history records the creator but neither a live slot nor an
      attested tree edge exists. The row proves the session was created without
      claiming whether it finished or was lost.

    READ-ONLY. The history catalog and metadata reads touch disk; callers keep the
    operation informational and expose their quality separately from the crew-log
    tree quality.

    The union is bounded at :data:`MAX_SESSION_STATUS_ROWS`, and that cut gets its
    OWN field: ``roster_omitted`` counts the rows dropped, zero when the whole
    union was retained. It is deliberately not expressed by degrading ``history``,
    which describes the transcript scan alone — a union cut is not a read fault in
    any source, and spelling it that way blames a read that completed while
    ``history_omitted`` still reports nothing cut.

    The ownership fence applies to the rows, not just to the verb: a fenced caller
    (a crew member, a cron, an agent-created session) sees the live sessions it
    created and nothing else, so this verb cannot become a way to enumerate the
    user's own sessions by their titles. A ``gone`` row carries only a slot key the
