"""Crash-dump store — dedicated file routing for loop-stall watchdog dumps.

The existing loop_watchdog.py captures thread stacks on
event-loop wedge via faulthandler.  However, those dumps land in raw stderr
(interleaved with all other output in journal/terminal) and are effectively
undiscoverable.

This module provides:

1. A DEDICATED crash-dump file opened at gateway startup that faulthandler writes
   to directly (faulthandler needs a stable fd for process lifetime).
2. Rotation: keeps last N dumps, removes oldest on startup.
3. Newest-dump detection for doctor/startup surfacing.

Dump directory: ``<data home>/logs/crash-dumps/`` (data home = ``config_dir()``,
i.e. ``~/.kiro/crew`` or ``$KIROCREW_HOME``)
Filename pattern: ``loopstall-<ISO timestamp>.txt``

**fd lifetime guarantee:**

``faulthandler.dump_traceback_later`` captures a raw C file descriptor at arm
time and writes to it on its own C thread when the timer fires.  If the fd is
invalidated (closed, reassigned, or GC'd) between arm and fire, the dump writes
to nothing — or worse, to a recycled fd — and the crash file contains only the
header written at open time.

To prevent this, :func:`open_dump_file` obtains the fd via :func:`os.open`
(lowest-level, no Python buffering layer that could close/dup the fd behind our
back), wraps it in a *non-closing* Python file object for the header write, and
returns a :class:`DumpFile` that exposes ``.fileno()`` (what faulthandler needs)
while guaranteeing the underlying fd is never closed until the process exits.

    so a recorded value that differs from the live probe means the owner is
    GONE even though the PID is live.

    The identity comes from :func:`platform_compat.get_process_start_id`, the
    routine this repository already uses wherever a start identity is WRITTEN
    DOWN and compared back later (``mcp_gateway.claim``, ``session_pid``,

    procfs field 22 on Linux, ``libproc`` microsecond start on macOS, and the
    process creation ``FILETIME`` through a query-only handle on Windows — and
    never emits whitespace or ``:``, so the recorded value stays one ``# PID:``
    header token.

    -o lstart=``: 1-second, locale- and TZ-rendered, and documented as safe
    precisely because "a format or resolution drift can only make the guard
    decline to act". That is a KILL-guard contract, where a mismatch means do

    its fd, and ``cron_inflight.RunningMarker.owner_alive`` reads the same
    identity to conclude a run was abandoned — so a drifted render destroys a
    live gateway's evidence rather than declining to act. Two gateways sharing
    one data home need only differ in ``TZ`` or ``LC_TIME`` to render the same
    instant differently, and 1-second granularity cannot separate two processes
    that started in the same second.

    Returns ``None`` where the identity is unknown — a platform the routine
    does not cover, or a process this one may not introspect. Per that
    routine's own contract a ``None`` must NOT be read as a mismatch: callers
