    ``"declared"`` means repo-supplied config names a content-filter driver.
    ``"unreadable"`` means the probe could not prove one absent, so nothing is
    known about a driver at all. Both refuse -- neither can be proven safe --
    but they are different facts and the reader is told the one that applies:
    collapsing them onto one message made the common case (an LFS repo) read as
    a disjunction the caller had already resolved.

    Mirrors ``worktree.py::_checkout_filter``: drivers can only come from a
    config file the repository supplies — ``--local`` (``.git/config``) and,
    when ``extensions.worktreeConfig`` is on, ``--worktree``
    (``$GIT_DIR/config.worktree``). The worktree scope is PROBED FIRST and a
    failure classified AFTERWARDS: git creates ``config.worktree`` lazily, so
    a probe that failed because the file is genuinely absent is the empty
    scope, not an unreadable one — while an existence pre-check would drop
    the scope on a stale fact and never look at a file git goes on to read.
    ``--includes`` is mandatory: a specific-scope
    query defaults include-following OFF, so a driver reached through
    ``include.path`` would be invisible to the probe yet still execute.
    Global/system config is deliberately not probed (the user's own machine
    setup, e.g. ``git lfs install``, is not repository-supplied). Any other
    probe failure refuses: an unreadable scope cannot be proven filter-free.
    The probe itself is safe — ``git config`` reads files and never runs
    drivers.

    # renders them as separate rows (identical originals redact identically, so

    # has an identical tuple, so it still collapses.
