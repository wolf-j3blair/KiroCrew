"""Session transfer — copy a session between Kiro Crew instances.

Two halves live here:

* :func:`build_transfer_bundle_async` serialises one slot's visible conversation
  into a portable, version-tagged dict. Called on the **sending** side.
* :func:`api_chat_slot_import` accepts such a dict and materialises it as a new
  slot. Called on the **receiving** side.

The wire hop between them is an ordinary authenticated dashboard request over
an Instances tunnel; see [instances.md](../../../docs/system-specs/modules/instances.md) §14.

``session_export`` is the third consumer: it streams the SAME bundle to a file
so the two machines need not be online at the same time. It adds no format.
``bundle_version`` stays 2 and the ``source`` record below is additive, because
:func:`_validate_bundle` refuses an unrecognised version outright while silently
dropping keys it does not know: a version bump would stop an instance that has
not updated from receiving anything, where a new optional key costs it nothing.
Nothing in this module ever requires a field to be present.

**``source`` is recorded, never applied.** It carries what the conversation ran
under — model, reasoning effort, tool-approval policy, workspace, project, plus
the export instant and the producing gateway's version — for a HUMAN reading the
file to judge what they are looking at. No import path reads it, and
``approval_policy`` in particular is never applied: ``"auto"`` means auto-approve
every tool, so applying a recorded copy would let a session arrive on another
machine pre-authorised to run tools without prompting. An imported session always
lands interactive.

**Two layers travel.** *Layer A* is the visible transcript (the bundle's
``messages``) — what the imported tab DISPLAYS. *Layer B* (bundle_version 2) is
the kiro-cli context window itself (``<sid>.json`` + ``<sid>.jsonl``, stored
outside the crew home and joined via ``session_map.json``): carrying it lets the
imported session RESUME with full fidelity through ``session/load`` rather than
replaying the transcript as a lossy ~8K prefix. Layer B is optional — a v1
sender, or a session that never opened a kiro-cli context, ships Layer A only
and the peer falls back to the prefix. Sub-agent conversations do NOT travel;
their results already live inside Layer B as injected context.

**Copy, never move.** Import always allocates a NEW slot key and never touches
an existing session, so a transfer leaves the source intact and can be repeated
safely. Nothing here deletes anything.

**What deliberately does NOT travel.** A session's transcript is portable text,
but most of its *metadata* is a reference into the local instance's object graph
— a project path, a folder id, a workspace's memory, an agent template, a bound
artifact. Carrying those across would produce dangling references that render
as broken UI on arrival, so the bundle carries the transcript, the title, and an
agent *hint* only:

* ``project`` is intentionally dropped. The source's checkout path almost never
  exists on the target host (a Mac worktree path on a Linux dev desk), and a
  slot pointing at a missing directory scopes file search and steering to
  nothing. The imported session arrives with no project so the user re-picks it.
* ``model`` is not carried. Accounts differ in entitlement, so a model id that
  the source account is served can fail at runtime on the target; the target
  resolves its own default instead (see
  docs/system-specs/common/model-selection.md).
* ``workspace`` is not carried. Workspaces are per-instance memory scopes, and a
  name that matches on both hosts still means two different memories.
* ``agent`` is carried as a hint and applied ONLY if the target has an agent by
  that name; otherwise it is dropped rather than left dangling.
* ``folder_id``, ``tags``, ``pinned``, ``artifact``, ``app``,
  ``linked_session_key`` and ``forked_from`` are all local-graph references and
  are not carried at all. The arriving session's PLACEMENT is nonetheless not the
  top level: it is derived locally from ``origin`` by
  :mod:`kiro_crew.dashboard.arrival_folders`, which files it under
  ``Imported`` / ``from <sender>``. That is the opposite of carrying the sender's
  ``folder_id`` — no id crosses the wire, and the folder is one on THIS instance.

    ``approval_policy`` is the one that has to be said out loud: ``"auto"`` means
    auto-approve every tool, so an *applied* copy would let a session arrive on
    another machine pre-authorised to run tools without prompting — the same
    class of escalation ``subagent._validate_agent`` refuses when it declines to
    default an unknown agent name. An installed session always lands interactive.

    **The reader is a person, not a caller.** An export is a user-facing artifact

    install a session needs to know what model produced it, at what effort, and
    above all whether the transcript was produced under auto-approval. Every

    ``origin`` and ``agent`` are NOT repeated here: both already sit at the top

    **A field is omitted rather than written empty.** Absence means "not known",
    which is a distinct and useful statement, and it is also the format's own
    compatibility mechanism: a reader asks whether a key is present and
    well-formed, never whether a version implies it must be there, so every key
    must be safe to leave out.

    ``approval_policy`` is the exception to that rule, because for it an empty
    string is a VALUE and not an absence — ``""`` is the interactive policy, the
    same spelling the session object uses. It is therefore keyed off ``None``
    (this gateway could not read a policy) rather than off emptiness, so
    "interactive" and "unknown" stay distinguishable. Collapsing them would make

    """Serialise *slot*'s visible conversation into a portable bundle, with the
    disk read off the event loop.

    Carries the FULL conversation rather than only the window currently held in
    memory — a long-running session keeps just its tail resident, and bundling
    ``slot.messages`` alone would silently truncate the transfer to that tail.
    *origin* is a human label for where the session came from (an instance name
    or ``"local"``); it is recorded for provenance and shown on arrival.

    *with_source* adds the ``source`` provenance record of
    :func:`build_source_record`. It is OFF by default so the tunnel keeps
    producing exactly the bundle it produces today: a peer's importer would drop
    the key harmlessly, but a send is an existing working flow and this feature
    has no business changing what it puts on the wire. The file export turns it
    on, because a file outlives the tab it came from and a reader of one has
    nothing else to tell them what the session ran under.

    *include_layer_b* is the gate on the model's context window; it defaults to
    carrying Layer B. The tunnel send uses that default, so a copy pushed between
    two live gateways RESUMES rather than replaying a lossy prefix. The file
    export does NOT use the default: it passes ``True`` only when the operator has
    opted in both at the config layer (``dashboard.export_include_layer_b``, off by
    default) and on the specific request, because a downloaded file can be shared
    with another person and unredacted context must not ride along unasked (the
    RFC's conjunctive minimum bar, rfc-s3-backup.md:317-319; the risk is the
    operator's per O1). Layer B ships byte-exact and unredacted (see
    :func:`_read_layer_b`), which is forced rather than chosen -- the thinking-block
    signatures inside it are validated on replay, so redacting and transplanting
    cannot both hold, and there is no redacted variant. A caller passing ``False``
    withholds it and the bundle sets ``layer_b_skipped``, so the lost resume
    fidelity is stated rather than inferred from an absent key. Even when a caller
    asks to carry Layer B, this builder still withholds it for a mid-turn snapshot
    (see below), using the same ``layer_b_skipped`` flag; that consistency decision
    is independent of the caller's gate. A session that never opened a kiro-cli
    context sets neither ``layer_b`` nor ``layer_b_skipped``, because there is no
    context to lose.

    The un-flushed tail is a ``_disk_window_len`` boundary slice, which is valid
    only because the flush below runs first: the save folds a durable injector's
    ``append_if_absent`` copy into the window and advances the boundary, so the
    counter is honest by the time the tail is snapshotted. A caller that bundled
    WITHOUT flushing could not use this slice — a durable injector
    (``cron_inject``, ``workflow_inject``) puts the same row into
    the window and onto disk without a save, so the boundary would start one row
    too early and ship the injection twice. There is deliberately no such
    caller: this is the only builder, and it always flushes.

    The transcript read is synchronous file IO plus JSON parsing over a whole
    session, which is exactly the "large synchronous file IO" the
    ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`` rule forbids on the loop: on a long
    session it stalls every other task, and because the liveness heartbeat is
    itself a coroutine a stalled loop cannot pet LoopStallWatchdog, which then
    exits the gateway.

    **Offloading introduces an await, so the snapshot must be checked for
    consistency.** While we are off the loop the periodic 5s flush can run: it
    writes the dirty tail to disk AND advances ``_resumed_count`` / clears
    ``_dirty``. If that lands between our read and our merge, a naive merge reads
    pre-flush disk content and then sees a clean slot — silently dropping the
    tail from the copy.

    Because a completed flush advances ``_disk_window_len`` (the persisted
    boundary) as it writes, an unchanged value across the await is positive proof
    that no flush landed: ``history`` then corresponds exactly to
    ``messages[:_disk_window_len]``, so the tail merge is consistent. On a change
    we retry against the new state. Messages arriving during the await are
    harmless — they extend the tail we are about to copy, they do not move the
    boundary.

    If the retries are exhausted (a flush would have to land inside every one of
    them, which the 5s cadence makes effectively impossible), the transfer
    **fails** with :class:`SnapshotUnstable`. It deliberately does not fall back
    to an inline read: that would trade a lossy transcript for a blocking one,
    and on a large active session the blocking read is what starves the heartbeat
    into a watchdog-triggered gateway exit. Failing costs nothing here — a
    transfer is a copy, so the source is untouched and the user can just retry —
    which makes it strictly better than either losing turns or wedging the
    gateway.

    """Read the request body as a bundle document. Returns ``(body, error)``.

    Accepts BOTH shapes the two callers send, distinguished by the body's own first
    two bytes: **gzip** — the file ``GET /api/chat/slots/{key}/export`` hands the
    user, byte for byte — and **plain JSON**, what the tunnel's server-to-server
    ``send_session_bundle`` posts. Sniffing the magic rather than branching on
    ``Content-Type`` keeps a browser upload, a peer's plain POST and the export file
    all working without asking any caller to relabel what it already sends.

    **The body streams to disk; it is never held in memory.** The raw body is
    written to a temp file under the crew home a chunk at a time
    (:func:`_stream_request_to_file`), a gzip body is stream-decompressed to a
    second temp file (:func:`_gunzip_file`), and only the parse loads the document.
    Reading ``request.content`` rather than ``request.read()`` is deliberate: it
    bypasses the Application's ``client_max_size`` — matching the streaming multipart
    upload path — so a session of any size arrives rather than being refused, which
    is the owner's decision that a transfer is never blocked by size. Memory safety
    comes from the disk write, the concurrency permit and the memory admission
    (:func:`_memory_admission`) in front of the parse, not from a size ceiling.

    **There is no size wall.** A gzip bomb is stopped by the disk it would fill,
    not by a byte ceiling: both the raw stream and the decompression stop once the
    volume is down to its headroom (``507 transfer_disk_full``).

    **The permit spans the rest of the arrival.** :func:`_expansion_admission` is
    entered on *keep*, the CALLER's stack, once the body is on disk, so it is
    still held when this returns. A parsed bundle stays resident — through
    validation, redaction and persistence — until the arrival finishes, and N
    unbounded arrivals at once are the sum the permit bounds; releasing it here
    would leave that count unbounded. The upload itself is not under the permit:
    it holds one chunk of memory however large or slow it is, a sender that goes
    quiet is cut off by the no-progress deadline, and the number streaming at
    once is capped by :func:`_upload_admission`. The temp files, by
    contrast, are removed as soon as the document is parsed — it is the parsed
    bundle that must be bounded, not the bytes on disk.

    Args:
        request: the arriving request; its body stream is read once.
        keep: the arrival's own stack, which the arrival permit is entered on.

    decide either how its bytes are read or where the session lands.

    # common case unchecked: a ``DELETE /api/sessions/{key}`` landing in the
    # folder-existence await removes this transcript and pops the slot while the
    # folder it pointed at is still perfectly fine, so the branch is skipped and
    # the handler would answer ``200 ok`` for data that has already been
    # destroyed. Nothing downstream corrects that -- the success return does not
    # re-arm ``_dirty`` and the delete's pop is terminal -- so the misleading
    # ``ok`` is the permanent record.
    #
    # The second half of that heading carries as much weight as the first, and is
    # why the arrival-row mark sits above: any await between this check and the
    # response reopens the very window the check closes, because the delete lands
    # inside that await and the check has already passed.
    # ``test_a_delete_landing_in_the_shared_row_mark_refuses`` is what keeps an
    # await from drifting back below it.
    #
    # Unconditional rather than an ``elif``, which would be the cheaper shape and
    # the wrong one: a successful ``save_slot_off_loop`` does NOT imply the
    # delete-won guard reached a decision, because ``best_effort`` converts a
    # raising save to ``True``. Checking every time makes "no path reaches ``ok``
    # without passing the witness" true by structure instead of by case analysis,
    # and ``test_the_witness_still_runs_when_the_repair_save_reported_success``
    # is what keeps that shape from being quietly narrowed back to an ``elif``.
    # The cost is one extra ``stat`` per import, which a request already bounded
    # by the live-slot cap can carry.
    #
    # ``session_was_deleted`` is the module's own witness -- already used twice on
    # the EXPORT path here, and its docstring names this caller class: one that
    # republishes a slot's content and so cannot rely on observing the guard's
    # ``False``, because the periodic flush can reach the guard first and clear
    # ``_dirty``. Off the loop because it stats and reads metadata; the export
    # sites call it bare only because the whole builder already runs in a thread.
