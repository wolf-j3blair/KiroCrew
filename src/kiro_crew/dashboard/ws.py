    The durable half of the Subagents panel, and the crew log is where it comes
    from: the log is the record, so every count, outcome, duration and cost a card
    draws is a fold of it rather than a second store kept in step by hand. What
    this reads is the ``subagents`` fold's rows plus the ``class`` fold's ``app``,
    both folded in ONE pass per unit.

    *units* is ``(slot_key, unit_id)`` per crew-log UNIT, resolved on the event
    loop by the caller. A unit id is the ACP session id the log was opened under,
    which is NOT the slot's session key: a slot owns one id at a time, so its
    history is spread over a unit per id it ran under and a finished child can sit
    in any of them (``session_ledger.crew_log_units``). The slot is carried
    alongside because it is what a frame is routed by and what the ownership gate
    asks about, and deriving it back from a unit id is not possible.

    ``app`` comes from the ``class`` fold, which keeps the FIRST owner the session
    ever had and never moves off it. That is what the cross-app guard needs: a
    slot key is caller-supplied and not namespaced, so the key a run was recorded
    under can later be minted by a different app, and comparing the live slot's
    owner against the log's own recorded owner is what refuses the old run to the
    new one.

    A dismissed run never reaches here: the user's dismissal is an entry in this
    same log, so the ``subagents`` fold stops offering the row and this read has
    no dismissal store to consult. The log is where it has to be recorded, because
    a store beside the log is reclaimed on its own schedule: a registry keyed on
    the run's folder at both ends drops its record when that folder is pruned,
    while this read still finds the child the log kept.

    Only a CLOSED child is returned. A row with no outcome is a child still in
    flight, and this process is not the one tracking it: a card drawn from it
    would wear a running pill nothing will ever advance. The fold's own ``running``
    count is what states those, and the panel section draws it.

    Ordered newest-first on each row's ``started_ms``, which is why the fold keeps
    it: ``seq_spawned`` orders rows inside one log and says nothing across two.

    measures. Clamped at 0 so a clock adjustment cannot produce a negative span.
