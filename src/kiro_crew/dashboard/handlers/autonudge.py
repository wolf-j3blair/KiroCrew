#: Legacy loop fields WITHHELD from a structured monitor's legacy projection.
#:
#: The legacy reads carry no owner gate, so what they may publish is decided by
#: ENTITLEMENT, not by convenience: a caller already reaching them is entitled to
#: know that something is monitoring this session, roughly how often, how far in
#: and in what state. It is not entitled to know WHAT is being watched. Each name
#: below is withheld for one of two reasons, and no withheld field is replaced by
#: a null, an empty string or a plausible default -- an absent field reads as
#: "this surface does not carry that", where a faked one reads as fact.
#:
#: OWNER-SCOPED, because it describes the subject or the evidence:
#:
#: * ``monitor`` -- the whole ``monitor_state_public_dict``: target URL,
#:   objective, kind, budgets, wake instructions, the provider-controlled
#:   observation payload and every fingerprint. Published only by
#:   ``/api/monitors`` and its per-slot sibling, both behind
#:   ``_require_monitor_owner``, and to owners only on the ``autonudge_state``
#:   websocket frame via ``broadcast_ws_owners``.
#: * ``message`` -- for a structured monitor this IS the wake instructions.
#:   Both arming paths set ``message=monitor.wake_instructions or "structured
#:   monitor"``, so returning the legacy field verbatim would publish
#:   owner-scoped text through a field that looks innocuous.
#: * ``banner`` -- the same class of agent-authored display text, and a monitor
#:   has no banner to describe.
#: * ``stop_sentinel_path`` -- a filesystem path, and the structured branch of
#:   ``_timer`` returns before the sentinel is ever tested.
#:
#: UNMAINTAINED on the structured path -- but two of these three have a TRUTHFUL
#: equivalent in the monitor's own state, so they are MAPPED (below) rather than
#: withheld. Withholding them was worse than an imprecise truth: the component
#: defaults an absent ``max_cycles`` to 0, whose label reads "0 = infinity", so
#: the panel asserted that a budget-bounded monitor runs forever. A default that
#: lies is a stronger falsehood than a slightly coarse number.
#:
#: ``stop_sentinel_path`` has no equivalent and stays withheld: the structured
#: branch of ``_timer`` returns before the sentinel is ever tested, and a
#: filesystem path is owner-scoped regardless.
#:
#: ``config_generation`` is internal fence bookkeeping -- the token the
#: structural-terminal stop compares against to refuse a stale completion. It is
#: the automation's own private counter, carries no legacy-panel meaning, and has
#: no truthful structured equivalent to MAP, so it is withheld like
#: ``stop_sentinel_path`` rather than published or faked.
#:
#: A GATED prompt loop is in NEITHER case: it carries probe state but still
#: delivers down the legacy path, so its message and its cycle accounting are
#: real, and ``is_structured_monitor_loop`` already excludes it.
#:
#: ``goal_token`` is an authorisation a client sends back, not a fact about the subject.

        # projection, and each for its own reason rather than as a block. A plain
        # loop -- which is where a judge actually lives -- does not pass through
        # this filter at all: it goes through ``_serialize``, which publishes
        # ``judge``, ``judge_quiet_streak`` and ``judge_last_verdict`` and drops
        # only ``judge_cursors``. That asymmetry is deliberate and was ruled on: the
        # popover has to render the brief and the last reading for the owner, and the
        # brief is the owner's own sentences about their own loop. A structured
        # monitor is held to the stricter line because its record is owner-scoped
        # everywhere else it is published.
        #
        # * ``judge`` is the owner's brief, carrying their ``wake_when`` /
        #   ``quiet_when`` prose. Withheld HERE because a structured monitor's
        #   subject is exactly what this route may not disclose.
        # * ``judge_cursors`` is bookkeeping with no surface, and it names every
        #   watched target: withheld on every projection, not just this one.
        # * ``judge_pr_seen`` is the same: a digest plus the ids of the remarks the
        #   loop was already shown, which names the subject's discussion. Also
        #   withheld on every projection.
        # * ``judge_quiet_streak`` and ``judge_last_verdict`` are the automation's
        #   own accounting, the same class as ``cycle_count``. The verdict is
        #   text-free by construction -- an outcome, an item COUNT and a timestamp --
        #   so it can be published without carrying anything the judge read.
        # * ``judge_wake_pending`` is a bare boolean -- one owed turn, or none -- and
        #   names nothing at all. Withheld anyway, for the reason ``judge_quiet_streak``
        #   is: this route holds a structured monitor to the stricter line, and the
        #   plain loop that has a popover to render gets it from ``_serialize``.
        # * ``judge_recent_verdicts`` is the automation's own calibration accounting,
        #   like ``judge_quiet_streak``, and no surface renders it.

#: Legacy field -> the monitor attribute path carrying its truthful value.
#:
#: Each is the automation's OWN accounting, not a fact about its subject, so none
#: crosses the entitlement boundary -- and this route already publishes
#: ``max_runtime_secs`` straight from ``budgets``, so a second budget is the same
#: class rather than a new one.
#:
#: * ``max_cycles`` <- ``budgets.max_agent_turns``. A legacy "cycle" IS a
#:   delivered turn, which is exactly what that budget bounds.
#: * ``cycle_count`` <- ``agent_turns``, the numerator of the same reading.
#:   Carrying the bound alone would render "0 of 8" for a monitor that has spent
#:   turns, replacing one falsehood with another.
#: * ``last_fire_ts`` <- ``last_completed_at``, which ``autonudge.py`` writes in
#:   the same step as ``wake_count += 1``, so it is when this automation last
#:   delivered; 0.0 means none has, which renders "never" truthfully. NOT
#:   ``last_probe_at`` -- a probe that woke nothing is not a fire, and mapping it
#:   would invent an event.

#: The ONE thing a reduced row does NOT carry that a reader may want: how far in
#: the monitor is. `cycle_count` is withheld above because for a monitor it is
#: false, and nothing replaces it here.
#:
#: A `monitor_presence` object (`probe_count`, `wake_count`, `outcome`) was
#: prepared for exactly that and is deliberately NOT shipped on this route. It
#: would have had no reader: the popover rendering that would display it is
#: sequenced separately, and this route's one unproven claim is precisely whether
#: a consumer handles what it is sent. A field whose arrival AND display can be
#: tested in one change belongs in that change. So the liveness gap is REAL and
#: recorded, not silently filled.
#:
#: Consequence a reader must know: a reduced row carries no positive marker
#: saying "this is a monitor". It is told apart by the ABSENCE of the withheld
#: fields, which is weaker than a marker and is the other half of what the
#: rendering change should add.

    """POST /api/autonudge/{loop_id}/fire — run this loop's next cycle now.

    The manual counterpart of the idle timer, for the case the loop's interval
    cannot serve: the operator already knows the thing being waited on has
    changed, so the remaining gap buys nothing. Spelled ``fire`` rather than the
    cron sibling's ``run`` because ``fire`` is this subsystem's own verb
    (``_on_fire``, ``_run_fire_cycle``, ``last_fire_ts``, the ``fired`` event).

    Thin HTTP mapping, as everywhere else in this file: ``svc.fire_now`` owns the
    schedule semantics and the not-registered / not-active / mid-fire refusals,
    and documents why each is load-bearing. Two refusals belong here instead,
    because they are about the transport's own subject rather than the loop:

    * A **structured monitor** is refused with the same 409 code ``PATCH`` uses.
      Those records are driven by ``_on_monitor_tick`` and owned by the monitor
      API, so a manual cycle here would deliver a legacy prompt for a record that
      never takes that path. The goal popover DOES see one -- the read routes
      above return it -- which is why this refusal has to be stated rather than
      left to the reader being unable to reach it.
    * A **busy session** is refused rather than queued, and that is not a fresh
      product decision — the fire path this route arms already made it, with its
      reason written down at the site: queueing "would stack identical 3KB+
      nudges and blow up the context window" (``_fire_dashboard_nudge``). The
      predicate is the repository's canonical one, ``slot.running or
      slot._in_stage_execution``, read here exactly as the cron-injection
      handler reads it (``handlers/messaging.py``) — ``slot.running`` alone is
      False between the stages of a multi-stage plan, so it would let this land
      a concurrent turn on top of the plan. Note the two consumers of that
      predicate diverge deliberately: the cron path QUEUES, this one REFUSES,
      and the nudge path's stated reason is the one that applies here.

      This check is an AFFORDANCE, not a guarantee: a turn that starts between
      it and the fire is still refused by the fire path, which then re-arms with
      backoff. Its whole job is to turn that silence into a 409 the popover can
      show. A loop bound to a channel key has no dashboard slot, so the check
      is skipped and that transport's own busy guard answers.

    Authentication is the same as its ``POST`` / ``PATCH`` / ``DELETE`` siblings
    on this path, deliberately: no new trust boundary, and this route is
    strictly LESS powerful than the ``POST`` beside it, which arms a loop that
    can spend turns until a bound stops it.

    **Every outcome is audited, and the FIRE is audit-or-deny.** The split is the
    one this repository already draws, not a new policy:

    * The **fire** is gated on a ``critical=True`` write that lands BEFORE
      ``fire_now`` arms anything. The default path only ENQUEUES, and on the
      event loop an enqueue failure drops the event with a warning
      (``sel.py``), so a best-effort pre-audit would still let a model turn run
      unrecorded -- the audit would be a hope, not a gate. ``critical`` writes
      synchronously and re-raises, and the write is awaited through
      ``asyncio.to_thread`` because a synchronous flush on the loop would freeze
      every session's turn (``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop``). This is the same
      shape this subsystem's own ``autonudge_authz`` uses for ``monitor_update``
      and ``monitor_stop``, and the 503 mirrors ``handlers/cron.py``'s
      ``audit_unavailable`` refusal for a grant it could not record.
    * The **refusals** stay best-effort, but they are audited BEFORE
      ``fire_now`` returns: a guard below that denied a request and left no SEL
      event at all would be a real hole. Making them critical would trade an
      audit-sink problem for a different failure while preventing nothing: the
      request is refused either way, so availability must not hinge on SEL disk
      health. That is the disposition
      ``messaging/identity`` states for a deny and ``azure_client`` states for a
      post-action outcome.
    * The **terminal** event after ``fire_now`` is best-effort for the same
      reason: by then the timer is armed and the ``invoked`` record has landed,
      so raising would replace a real result with a logging error.

    Routing every exit through these two helpers is what makes the property
    structural rather than a habit: a guard added later cannot silently skip the
    record, because there is no un-audited way out.
