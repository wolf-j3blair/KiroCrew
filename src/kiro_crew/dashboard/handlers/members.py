"""Crew Members HTTP handlers — roster and per-member DM thread binding.

The Crew Members page talks to each crew member in one durable, pinned DM
thread. The thread's slot key is DERIVED (``member-<slug>``) and its binding
lives in the member's own space (``members/<slug>/dm.json``), so the mapping
survives restarts independently of the slot layer's own persistence.

Member slots are born ONLY here, with ``mode="member"``: the generic slot
create endpoint's ``_CREATABLE_MODES`` deliberately excludes it, and the
frontend's chat-ownership predicate (``isChatPageSurface``) does not admit it,
which is what keeps member threads out of the ordinary Sessions list with no
filtering code anywhere.

Dashboard-only surface: app tokens are denied outright (deny-by-default, same
posture as slot access — an app has no business enumerating the user's crews
or opening threads that speak as them).

    list makes every row carry three views nothing on it reads, and the cost of
    each is the fold it walks.

    A CONTRIBUTED row is painted on the list row too, so it stays: the protocol puts
    it in the same ``values`` map as the built-in views precisely so the client needs
    no second path for it, and narrowing to the built-in roster view alone would drop

    Their ``seqs``, ``stateVersions`` and ``schemas`` ride along narrowed to the same
    keys, because a contributed row orders on (stateVersion, seq) and a client given
    the value without the pair cannot tell a deletion from a stale frame.

    ``asOfSeq`` is carried through unchanged because it is a property of the LOG,
    not of the subset: the client seeds each key at that sequence under its
    higher-seq-wins rule, so a live frame that already moved a row past it keeps
    winning, and a key absent from this block leaves whatever the client holds for

    What the detail drawer mounts on. The roster list carries only the view a list
    ROW paints; the drawer paints the activity timeline, the patrol state and the
    driven-slot list, and it is open for exactly one member at a time, so it reads
    them here instead of every row carrying three views nothing on it reads.

    Serves the WHOLE snapshot rather than a named subset: the drawer reads three
    views today, the projection set is extensible (an app contributes its own
    ``<app>/<name>`` key), and a per-key allowlist here would silently withhold a
    view the moment one is added. The block is the same shape the roster ships and
    the same shape a ``member_projection`` frame carries, so the client seeds it
    through one code path.

    ``member`` (query, REQUIRED) is the exact crew name, for the same reason the
    activity read requires it: a slug is a lossy fold, two names can share one log,
    and a whole-member projection served on the wrong name renders one member's work
    as another's. The name is checked against the log's own header, and a mismatch
    answers 409 rather than a blank body -- the drawer has to be able to say WHY it
    is empty.

    A member with no log answers an empty BASELINE (``asOfSeq`` 0, no values),
    which is exactly what the roster sends for the same member, and the read does
    not create one: opening a drawer is not an event in that member's life. The
    negative sentinel is kept for a slug that cannot be attributed, because the
    client stops applying live frames to those and a member about to be written
    about for the first time must keep receiving them.

    Redacted through the projection chain before it leaves, the same as the roster

    # The member filter and the timestamp parse run INSIDE this read, before any
    # cap, because a log's newest N envelopes are not N of one member's activity
    # records. The same log also carries config, binding, rules, message, slot and
    # patrol events, and a colliding slug's log carries another exact name's
    # records as well -- so capping the envelope read first and filtering second
    # drops activity that is well inside the window the drawer promises.
    #
    # But the read is PAGED rather than asked for the whole log. `history` with
    # `limit=None` materialises every event in the lifetime file into a list and
    # reverses it, which is bounded only while the log still fits the retained tail
    # (`MAX_RETAINED_EVENTS`); past that the allocation is the file's whole length,
    # on a request path, for a response that shows `_ACTIVITY_LIMIT` rows. The log
    # has no rotation, so outgrowing the tail is ordinary ageing rather than an
    # extreme input. Paging keeps the filter where it has to be AND keeps the
    # allocation bounded: walk backwards a page at a time and stop as soon as one
    # more than the display cap has matched, which is all `capped` needs to know.

async def api_member_briefing(request: web.Request) -> web.Response:
    """GET /api/members/{slug}/briefing?member=<name> — a crewmate's own notes, read-only.

    Feeds the Crewmates page panel's Notes tab. The briefing
    (``members/<slug>/briefing.md``) is the crewmate's self-maintained standing
    notes — an AGENT-written file, curated by the crewmate for its future self.
    This endpoint reads and never writes, and the panel offers no editor for
    the file: the dashboard's file viewer reads through a redacting path and
    its Save writes the buffer back, so any in-dashboard edit of an
    agent-written file could replace a secret the crewmate wrote in the
    meantime with its placeholder. The notes are edited where the crewmate
    writes them, outside the dashboard.

    The text comes from :func:`members.read_member_briefing_bounded` and
    inherits its total contract: a missing or unreadable file reads as ``""``
    (the normal state of a fresh crewmate — never a 404), and content past
    ``MEMBER_BRIEFING_MAX_CHARS`` is cut at the cap with a visible marker
    (:func:`members.cap_member_briefing`, applied AFTER redaction so the cap
    cannot split a token past the patterns), which the panel renders as-is so
    the human sees the same overflow the crewmate is shown. ``supported`` is :func:`members.member_briefing_supported`:
    on platforms without ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and the pinned ancestor walk the read
    fails closed to ``""`` and the panel explains that from the flag rather
    than presenting an empty briefing as "no notes yet". ``updated_ts`` is the
    file's own mtime (epoch seconds) or ``null`` when there is no file.
    ``redacted`` and ``truncated`` each say the wire text shows less than the
    file holds (a secret replaced by its placeholder; a tail past the cap not
    shown), so the panel can say so above the notes instead of leaving
    placeholders and a marker unexplained. A successful read leaves a SEL row
    (``members.briefing.read`` / ``allowed``), as the rules read does.

    ``member`` (query, REQUIRED) is the exact crew name, same posture as the
    activity endpoint: slugification is lossy, and the exact name is echoed
    back so the frontend keys its cache by name rather than by a slug two
    crewmates can share -- and, as on the rules endpoint, the exact name must
    derive this slug, exist, and be the ONLY crew that derives it: the briefing
    is one file per slug, so for a colliding slug the notes belong to neither
    crewmate and the read is refused (409 ``briefing_slug_ambiguous``) rather
    than shown -- with an Edit -- as one of theirs.
