    ``cfg.to_dict()`` / ``cfg.save()`` serialize, since masking there would
    persist the sentinel and destroy the real secret (e.g. ``telegram.bot_token``).
    Safe here because no config write endpoint accepts sensitive fields; if one
    is ever added it MUST treat ``_SENSITIVE_MASK`` as "unchanged" and keep the
    stored value. Sensitivity is schema-driven (``sensitive=True`` field
    metadata), so newly added sensitive fields are masked automatically.

    Two masking passes. The schema walk covers owner-stored secrets
    (``sensitive=True``). A second pass covers agent-record free text
    (``_AGENT_UNTRUSTED_TEXT_FIELDS``): those values are agent- and
    package-writable, so a credential- or exfiltration-URL-shaped one is
    masked wholesale (``_mask_agent_free_text``) instead of shipping to the
    browser verbatim. The write-side note above holds for this pass too:
    neither branch of this endpoint can echo the mask into storage — the
    PATCH allowlist (``_EDITABLE_CONFIG``) names no ``agents.*`` path, and
    the PUT branch reads only the singular ``agent`` section against a
    hardcoded key list. The agents CRUD route is the write path for these
    fields; its read pair is ``GET /api/agents``, which ships them verbatim —
    that half of the class needs the same mask plus a mask-means-unchanged
    write rule this endpoint does not need. Named cost of the wider field set: the overview's config tab renders
    ``kiro_agent``/``workspace``/``memory_store`` and cross-references the
    latter two against the workspace and store lists, so a masked value breaks
    that "used by" row — but only for a record whose value is already
    credential-shaped, and therefore already meaningless as a reference.

    Distinct from liveness: the process may be UP (``/api/live`` 200) yet not
    able to serve application traffic. Readiness reflects the observable
    lifecycle state:

    * **Startup** — before the socket binds, connection failure is the external
      not-ready signal. After bind, ``DashboardState.ready`` remains false and
      the probe returns 503 while session restoration, tunnel setup, and other
      pre-ready wiring finishes.
    * **Serving** — the server publishes ``DashboardState.ready = True`` at the
      same final boundary used by the boot-to-ready metric; readiness is then
      200 while required control state is wired and shutdown has not been
      requested. The separately tracked memory preparation task starts at this
      boundary: memory content routes remain fail-closed and agent turns wait
      at admission until it settles.
    * **Shutdown requested** — when SIGTERM/SIGINT or ``POST /api/shutdown``
      sets the process-wide ``shutdown_event``, readiness changes to 503 while
      ``/api/live`` remains 200 until the HTTP server exits. Supervisors that
      poll during this interval can stop routing new work; this endpoint does
      not itself impose or promise a minimum load-balancer drain delay.

    Shutdown takes precedence over subsystem checks. The response carries only
    fixed, low-cardinality booleans/markers — no paths, ids, counts, secrets, or
    user/session content. The probe paths are exempt from the host_validation
    middleware (orchestrators address pods by IP — see origin.PROBE_PATHS), so
    a disallowed-Host request CAN reach this handler; the detail fields
    (startup/shutdown/subsystem markers) are therefore gated on ``check_host``,
    mirroring ``_liveness_payload``. A disallowed-Host caller gets only
    ``{"ready": bool}`` — exactly the bit the status code already tells it.

    Three conditions. The first is the whole of "no word changed" and the other two are
    about WHERE the words divide, which the first cannot see:

    1. Every character the candidate adds or drops is punctuation or whitespace --
       see :func:`_polish_only_marks_differ`. Nothing is normalised away before that
       comparison, so it covers every class of content at once: words changed, added,
       removed or reordered, symbols and control codes inserted or deleted, combining
       marks stripped, and any of those MOVED rather than altered.
    2. Every division in the original survives. ``"a part"`` and ``"apart"`` have
       identical letters and opposite meanings, and deleting a space is deleting
       whitespace, which rule 1 permits -- so where the words divide needs its own
       rule.
    3. A division the original did not have may only appear where the candidate's
       separator is punctuation a correction pass is entitled to insert: a MARK with
       no whitespace beside it, or a change of script. This is what keeps rule 2 from
       having to be symmetric, and the asymmetry is required rather than convenient:
       Chinese writes ``部署到测试环境`` as a single run, and the comma a punctuation
       pass exists to insert necessarily creates a new division. The whitespace part
       is what keeps the allowance from re-admitting the mirror of rule 2: a script
       that spaces its words already divides them, so correct punctuation there lands
       on a division that exists, and a mark arriving WITH a space inside a run that
       had none cuts that run in two -- ``"nowhere"`` returned as ``"now, here"`` is
       the bare-space corruption with a comma in front of it. A boundary between a
       script that SPACES its words and one that does not counts for the same reason
       the lone comma does: a space between Chinese and Latin text is a typographic
       fix, and it cannot produce the re-segmentation above, which needs one script on
       both sides. That test is about spacing and not about the scripts merely
       differing, because Japanese crosses kanji and kana inside one word and
       ``"caféine"`` crosses nothing at all.

    Together: marks and case may change freely, a mark may introduce a division, and
    nothing else may move. The prompt asks for exactly that and no more, because a
    helpful re-segmentation and a meaning change are the same edit seen from outside.

    an enqueue against the singleton warmed at startup, which is the whole reason

def _invalid_session_path_id(session_id: str, agent_id: str | None = None) -> web.Response | None:
    """400 for a path id ``session_workspace`` would refuse, else ``None``.

    Both ids reach a filesystem path (``sessions/{session_id}/agent-{agent_id}.md``)
    and are validated there by ``_validate_id``, which RAISES. The raise is the
    correct containment behaviour -- it is what stops ``..`` from escaping the
    session root -- but an un-caught one leaves the route answering 500 to what
    is really a malformed request, so it is translated here instead.

    The predicate is imported rather than restated: this must refuse exactly the
    set the path join refuses, no wider (a narrower guard would break the ``:``
    in a real key like ``dashboard:slot-3``) and no narrower (a wider one puts
    the 500 back). Shape follows ``cron.py``'s ``_invalid_path_id_response`` --
    400 with an ``invalid_<name>`` ``code`` -- the contract
    docs/system-specs/common/code-style.md requires of a backend-owned error body.

    ``agent_id`` is checked second because that is the order the sinks validate
    in, so the reported code names the half the caller must actually fix.

    ``is_valid_id`` is imported at module scope per AUTOSDE ``top-level-imports``
    -- there is no cycle, ``session_workspace`` pulling only stdlib and
    ``config.paths``. The three ``list_results`` / ``read_result`` /
    ``result_path`` imports below stay function-local: they are pre-existing, and
    hoisting them would bind the names here at import time, which is exactly what
    the existing tests' ``monkeypatch`` of ``kiro_crew.session_workspace.<fn>``
    relies on NOT happening. That is a separate change with its own test fallout.
