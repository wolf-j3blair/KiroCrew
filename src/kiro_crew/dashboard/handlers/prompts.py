    """The project whose ``.kiro/prompts`` this request's ``local`` scope names.

    Every prompt surface routes "This project" through here, so create, list,
    read, update and delete cannot disagree about where "local" is for one
    request. ``None`` means there is no local directory for this caller, which
    flows into the existing ``no_active_project`` contract on the write paths
    and simply omits ``source: "local"`` entries from a listing.

    Which question to ask depends on whether the request names a real chat, and
    the two cases genuinely differ:

    * A request whose ``X-Session-Key`` names an **existing slot** is speaking for
      one chat, so it gets :func:`requesting_slot_project` — that slot's project
      or nothing. This is the answer ``chat_runner`` reaches by reading
      ``slot.project`` when it expands an ``@mention``, so a prompt the chat
      surface will match is exactly the one this surface offers, and a chat with
      no project of its own is told so rather than shown a neighbour's checkout.
    * A request that names **no slot** is a global surface, and gets
      :func:`active_project_dir`'s fallback: the single project every open slot
      shares. That fallback is load-bearing, not laxity — the only surfaces that
      offer this scope (the overview Prompts tab and the command palette) sit
      outside any chat and have nothing to name, so the strict resolver would
      answer ``None`` for every request they can make and "This project" would be
      permanently dead there. Two chats on different projects still resolve
      ``None``: a settings page has no defensible answer then, and guessing would
      create, overwrite or delete in the wrong checkout.

    An **app** request gets no fallback and no foreign slot. App-token grants
    are path-only, so an app permitted to READ ``/api/prompts`` could otherwise
    name any slot in a forged ``X-Session-Key`` and use another slot's project
    as a prompt-content oracle; the shared-project fallback would hand it one
    without even a header. It resolves strictly per-slot and only for a slot it
    owns, so a mismatch narrows the answer to ``None`` — the app keeps the
    package SOPs and global prompts its grant already covered, and gains no
    local ones. Narrowing rather than refusing is deliberate: the endpoint's
    other content is not slot-scoped, so a 404 would withdraw a capability the
    grant does cover. Both outcomes are SEL-audited under one
    ``operation``/``source`` pair, so an app request leaves exactly one
    attributable line whether the selection was granted or refused — a forged key
    is visible, and so is which project a granted selection actually served.

    The ``dashboard:ui`` placeholder is folded to "no key" before any of that.
    It is what the browser sends when it has no chat to name, and the slot-name
    split would otherwise turn it into ``ui`` — so a user whose own chat is named
    ``ui`` would have that chat's checkout selected by every settings-page
    request, and a create, update or delete aimed at "This project" would land in
    it. Folded, those requests take the slotless path they belong on.

def _extract_sop_description(path: Path) -> str:
    """Description for a path the caller has NOT already read — the PACKAGE SOP walk.

    A user-prompt entry must use :func:`_gated_sop_description` instead, which
    pins its read inside the prompt root the entry was gated against; the scoped
    detail read must use :func:`_description_from_text`, on the bytes its read
    gate validated. This one is for the roots the platform seam supplies rather
    than a directory a checkout can write.

    Read through ``hooks.safe_read_file_bytes_nolink`` rather than by name. Every
    caller arrives here having already decided that *path* names a prompt, and a
    decision made about a NAME does not describe the file a later open by that
    name returns. Two things break the equivalence, and only one of them needs a
    race: the entry can be replaced between the decision and this open, and a
    HARDLINK needs no replacement at all — it shares its target's inode, so
    ``realpath`` yields the alias's own name, ``is_symlink()`` is False and
    ``is_sensitive_path`` sees an ordinary ``*.md`` sitting inside the prompt
    directory while the bytes belong to whatever it aliases. That is decisive
    here because a project's ``.kiro/prompts`` holds content the user CLONED and
    this description is PUBLISHED in the listing: an alias of ``~/.aws/credentials``
    would have that file's first ``#`` comment line served as a prompt's
    description, and its ``~/.ssh/config`` sibling likewise. The gate opens FIRST
    with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and judges the descriptor it actually read — refusing
    ``st_nlink > 1``, a non-regular inode, and an ``is_sensitive_path`` target —
    so the inode described is the inode validated. ``st_nlink`` is the only
    signal a second name for a protected inode leaves, and it is readable only on
    a descriptor.

    ``within_root`` is the canonical path's OWN parent, and it is what carries
    this guarantee onto Windows, where ``O_NOFOLLOW`` does not exist at all: the
    gate asks for it with ``getattr``, so there the open follows a leaf swapped
    for a link and only the fd-real-path check
    (``GetFinalPathNameByHandleW``) can still see that the inode opened is not the
    one resolved. Deriving the root from the canonicalized path rather than from
    an authorization is deliberate and sufficient for that job — a link the
    caller's entry legitimately points at is already followed by the
    canonicalization, so its target's own directory is the root, and only a
    substitution landing AFTER it escapes.

    A refusal yields NO DESCRIPTION rather than dropping the entry. Whether a
    prompt exists is the caller's decision, not this function's, and a library
    that lost a file because its metadata was refused would hide a name the
    scoped read still serves. That also keeps an unreadable prompt (a bad mode,
    a transient error) listed with an empty description, exactly as the by-name
    read did — but it is SEL-recorded, because an entry that lists with no
    description is otherwise identical to a prompt that simply has none, and a
    planted alias would leave the operator nothing to find. The decode failure
    below is not recorded: it is a property of bytes the gate already admitted,
    not a withheld read.

    ``allow_truncate`` keeps the gate's 50 MB cap a bound rather than a refusal:
    a description is frontmatter or the first heading, both at the head of the
    file, so a truncated read answers the same question, while raising would turn
    one oversized file into a 500 for the whole listing — something the
    unbounded by-name read could not do.

    Handed to ``safe_read_file_bytes_nolink`` as ``within_root``, which requires
    the OPENED descriptor's real path to resolve inside it. That closes what
    ``O_NOFOLLOW`` cannot: the flag guards only the final component, so an
    ANCESTOR directory swapped for a link would redirect the read out of the
    prompt tree with the leaf still looking ordinary.

    Answered only when the entry POSITIVELY names one of the two user scopes, and
    then by re-running that scope's OWN root gate rather than by assembling
    ``<project>/.kiro/prompts`` here. What that buys is the window from the MINT to
    the read: the entry was approved against a root the mint validated, and without
    this the read would confine itself to a root nothing had checked since — so a
    root swapped for a link any time after the listing or the exact-name lookup
    would have the gate ``realpath`` its way into the link's destination on both
    sides of the containment comparison, and an outside file carrying the matched
    prompt's own name would be what the ``@mention`` injects or the unscoped read
    returns in full.

    ``None`` therefore means REFUSE, not "unconstrained": for a user-scope entry it
    is the answer when the root is no longer serveable at all, and a read that
    fell back to the canonical path's parent there would be pinned inside exactly
    the directory the swap named. :func:`_prompt_read_within_root` is what turns
    that into a refusal, and is what every reader calls; a package SOP's fallback
    lives there too, so the two answers cannot drift apart.

    KNOWN RESIDUAL, stated rather than implied: ``within_root`` is a PATH, and
    ``safe_read_file_bytes_nolink`` ``realpath``s it at read time, so a root
    swapped between this derivation and that ``realpath`` is still followed. Two
    adjacent syscalls rather than a whole scan, but not closed. Closing it needs
    the read to happen RELATIVE to a held directory descriptor
    (``pinned_fs.open_dir_pinned``, which the write verbs already use), which is a
    ``safe_read_file_bytes_nolink`` contract change shared with its other ~40
    consumers — including the scoped read and the package-SOP description read on
    this same surface, which carry the identical residual — plus a decision about
    the name-based fallback on Windows, where ``_DIR_FD_SUPPORTED`` is False. It
    belongs in one change that moves every reader, not in three call sites.

    One derivation for every reader, because a root derived per reader is how two

    this is a function rather than an expression at each call site:

    * an entry naming the ``local`` or ``global`` scope is pinned inside the
      resolved root :func:`_prompt_read_root` answers;
    * the same entry with NO serveable root is refused. Falling back to

    * anything else — a package SOP, or an unfamiliar producer's entry shape — gets
      *canonical*'s own parent. Not a weaker authorization but the only one
      available: those roots are plural and come from the platform seam, so no
      single authorizing directory exists to name the way ``?scope=`` names one.
      It is still passed, because it is what carries the guarantee onto Windows,
      where ``O_NOFOLLOW`` does not exist at all and the gate's ``getattr`` for it
      yields 0 — there the open FOLLOWS a leaf swapped for a link after
      canonicalization, and only the fd-real-path check
      (``GetFinalPathNameByHandleW``) still sees that the inode opened is not the
      one resolved. A link the entry legitimately points at is already followed by
      the canonicalization, so its target's own directory IS that root and only a
      substitution landing after it escapes.

    """Description for a user-prompt entry, read through the no-link gate.

    :func:`_extract_sop_description` derives its ``within_root`` from the
    canonical path's own parent, which is the only root available to it — it
    spans the package SOP roots, which are plural and come from the platform
    seam. A user-prompt entry has a single authorizing root, so this one is given
    it: *root_real* is the prompt root RESOLVED ONCE by
    :func:`_local_prompt_scan_root`, not the caller-addressed directory. That
    distinction is the point. ``within_root`` is realpath'd inside the gate, so
    passing the as-addressed root would resolve through a root swapped for a link
    and admit the whole directory the swap named; passing the pinned value refuses
    it, because the opened descriptor's real path is then not inside the root the
    entry was approved against.

    The gate opens first with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and validates the descriptor it
    actually read, so the inode described is the inode approved even though the
    minting gate reached its verdict by ``lstat`` on a name. Without that, an
    entry swapped for a symlink between that ``lstat`` and this open would get its
    TARGET's first heading — or its ``description`` frontmatter — published in the
    listing, for a file every read verb on this API refuses; a project's
    ``.kiro/prompts`` is content the user cloned rather than authored, so that
    swap is a shape the directory's author can arrange. The scoped read derives
    its own description from validated bytes for exactly this reason.

    A refusal or an unreadable file yields an EMPTY description rather than a
    refusal to name the file: the entry's contract is that a bad mode or a
    transient I/O error surfaces as the read path's own error instead of a prompt
    silently vanishing from the user's library. That identical answer is why a
    withheld read is SEL-recorded — an entry listing with no description is
    otherwise byte-identical to a prompt that simply has none, so a planted alias
    would leave the operator nothing to find. Strict decode, so a file that is not
    UTF-8 yields no description rather than mojibake; that one is NOT recorded,
    being a property of bytes the gate already admitted.

    ``allow_truncate`` rather than a byte cap, for the reason
    :func:`_extract_sop_description` gives: a description is frontmatter or a
    first heading, both at the head of the file, so a truncated read answers the
    same question — while a cap that RAISED would cost an oversized prompt the
    description the by-name read gave it, and would make one oversized file the
    listing's problem rather than that prompt's.

    ``_find_prompt`` is reached once per turn that starts with ``@``, so resolving
    "local" by listing ``<project>/.kiro/prompts`` the way the prompts tab does
    would put a ``read_text`` per file — a description extraction for every prompt
    in the directory — on that turn, in a directory the gateway does not own and
    that may be network-backed. Being off the event loop bounds the blast radius
    of a slow read to the one turn; it does not make the read free. A local
    entry's ``name`` and ``fullName`` are both the
    file stem, so exactly one entry in that directory can ever match: find that
    one entry and gate it. The cost is then O(1) in the number of prompts the
    project keeps there rather than linear in it: the root gate's ``lstat`` and
    two ``resolve``s, one ``getdents``, the entry gate's own stats, and — only on
    a HIT — one ``read_text`` of the matched file for its description. The
    caller reads that same file again for the body it substitutes, so a resolved
    ``@mention`` opens the matched prompt twice; a MISS opens nothing.

    The candidate path is built from the **directory's own** entry name, never by
    joining *name* onto the prompt root. The two spellings would open the same
    inode — ``_plain_stem_ok`` runs first and rejects a separator, a ``..`` and a
    dotfile, so a joined name could not leave the directory either — but only the
    enumerated form makes that unconditional rather than a property of the
    predicate, and it is what lets a path-traversal analysis see it. ``@sub/foo``
    and ``@../escape`` are therefore misses that never reach the filesystem at
    all. ``os.scandir`` needs no ``stat`` to answer a name, so the comparison
    costs one ``getdents`` regardless of directory size.

    The ROOT is gated and pinned by ``_local_prompt_scan_root`` and the ENTRY by
    the parent package's ``_prompt_dir_entry`` — the same two gates the listing scan and
    every serving verb use, in the same order, so a name resolved here and a name
    resolved by the scan are refused on identical grounds. That includes

#: operation plus the junction check on the root is all that is available.

#: needs -- is a filesystem question, so it is asked inside the write job in the

#: overlayfs) cannot be probed at all: the capability is per-filesystem, so the

    This is what closes the check-to-use window the by-name paths leave open.
    ``_resolve_prompt_dir`` validates a PATH; an operation that then names
    ``<dir>/<stem>.md`` re-resolves every component afresh, so replacing a
    directory in between makes it land somewhere the check never saw. Operations
    performed relative to this descriptor reach the inode the walk pinned, no
    matter what the names mean by then.

    The mechanism — the openat-per-component walk, the ``ELOOP``/``ENOTDIR``
    translation, the capability probe — lives in :mod:`kiro_crew.pinned_fs`,
    whose charter (two closed PRs' worth of call-site rewrites) is that callers
    stay thin consumers of one set of invariants. This wrapper only supplies
    this handler's policy:

    * Which links are REFUSED deliberately matches ``_linked_prompt_root``
      rather than being stricter. An already-existing ancestor link is a
      location the user chose — ``/home/<user>`` is a link on many hosts and
      dotfile managers routinely symlink ``~/.kiro`` — and ``pinned_fs``
      tolerates it the documented way: the parent chain is realpathed ONCE
      before the walk, so a pre-existing link is followed by that resolution
      and only a component swapped after it is refused. The leaf refuses a
      link outright (``O_NOFOLLOW``), which is ``_linked_prompt_root``'s rule.
    * With *create*, the parents are ensured BY NAME first — the module's
      contract ("callers create their own tree roots"), and the same policy as
      the read path for pre-existing links — and only the leaf is created
      through its pinned parent.

    Raises :class:`pinned_fs.PinnedPathRefusal` for a linked or non-directory
    component (callers map it to ``linked_prompt_root``), and plain ``OSError``
    for operational failures, which reach the generic write-failure path.

    ``_resolve_prompt_dir`` answers WHETHER a root may be served; this answers
    which INODE that permission was granted for, and the two are different
    questions. Re-resolving the caller-addressed root at every containment decision
    downstream — ``_prompt_dir_entry``'s parent comparison and the ``within_root``
    its description read is pinned inside — would let a root swapped for a link
    after validation resolve into the link's destination on BOTH sides of every
    later comparison, so every file under the directory the swap named would look
    confined. Resolving once here and comparing against that fixed value refuses
    them instead:

    * a swap landing BEFORE this resolve makes the pinned value escape the
      project, which the containment gate below catches;
    * a swap landing AFTER it leaves every entry's resolved parent unequal to the
      pinned root, so the scan and the exact-name lookup both mint nothing.

    So the local library goes EMPTY under an active swap rather than publishing a
    foreign directory — the same outcome a statically redirected root already
    produces, and the same one every serving verb answers ``linked_prompt_root``
    for. Pinning a descriptor instead would additionally keep the honest entries
    listed through the swap, but ``dir_fd`` enumeration does not exist on Windows
    (``_DIR_FD_SUPPORTED``), so it would buy availability on one platform only
    while the refusal above is what the security property needs.

    The as-addressed root is returned alongside because enumeration must still
    walk the name the caller addressed: ``_prompt_dir_entry`` reports that
    spelling, which is what lets ``api_prompts`` fold ``$HOME`` to ``~`` and what

    bool is what lets :func:`_local_prompt_scan_root` hand every downstream
    containment check the very inode this gate approved instead of re-deriving it
    from a name that may since mean something else.

    The leaf-only rule in ``_linked_prompt_root`` tolerates ancestor links
    because a link under the user's own tree is a location the user chose. A
    project ``.kiro`` is authored by the REPOSITORY, not the user: a checkout
    shipping ``.kiro -> ~/.kiro`` would silently redirect local-scope writes
    and deletes into the global prompt tree. Comparing resolved-to-resolved
    keeps legitimately-linked project roots working while refusing any chain
    that leaves the project.

    ``project_dir`` is the caller's local project (or ``None``), supplied by the

    check is made against the very root the write was addressed to.

    ``RuntimeError`` is caught alongside ``OSError`` because ``Path.resolve()``
    signals a symlink LOOP that way and ``RuntimeError`` is not an ``OSError``.
    An ANCESTOR loop reaches here undetected: ``_linked_prompt_root``'s
    ``is_link_or_junction`` is ``os.path.islink``, which swallows the ``ELOOP``
    and answers False, so a checkout shipping ``.kiro -> .kiro`` arrives at this
    resolve. Both enumerating callers of this gate — the listing scan and the
    exact-name lookup — run it outside any broad handler catch, so letting the

            #   (2) never destroy a file another writer holds at the name;
            #   (3) leave the published inode at ONE link, because the read path
            #       a few hundred lines below goes through
            #       safe_read_file_bytes_nolink and refuses st_nlink > 1 -- a
            #       prompt with two links answers 403 forever, which is a worse
            #       dead end than the 409 this fixes;
            #   (4) leave nothing behind when the process dies mid-write.
            #
            # O_EXCL straight onto <stem>.md breaks (1): the name holds the body

            # and every retry is refused 409 -- the reported defect. A cleanup
            # cannot fully repair that, because POSIX has no unlink-by-inode:
            # verify-then-unlink is two syscalls on one NAME, so an atomic save
            # landing between them destroys the replacement, breaking (2).
            # Writing a NAMED temp and linking it into place breaks (3) and (4):
            # between the link and the temp's removal the inode carries two
            # links, and a process death there leaves the prompt permanently
            # unreadable. rename would clobber, and renameat2's RENAME_NOREPLACE

    Shape: a fast path off the assembly lock, then the lock, then a re-check UNDER
    it. The re-check is what coalesces -- readers queued behind the leader take the
    rows it just finished instead of each scanning (0% -> 87.5% at 8-way, measured).

    NOTHING is retained past the burst, so a read that is not concurrent with
    another always scans current on-disk state. No generation or epoch check is
    needed, but NOT because scans cannot overlap: cancelling a leader mid-scan
    leaves its executor thread running (a started thread-pool task is not
    cancellable) while a replacement leader starts its own, so two scans for one key
    CAN overlap. What holds instead is that the handoff is published only after an
    await returns, so a cancelled leader publishes nothing and its rows are
    discarded; the offer is dropped when its last reader leaves.

    The staleness this admits, stated exactly: any reader that shares a scan may be
    served rows read before its own arrival -- a mid-assembly joiner, and equally a
    reader arriving while the finished rows are still draining to their waiters. The
    bound is one assembly for that key, since a reader never queues behind another
    key's scan. There is NO read-after-write guarantee under a burst.

    ONE assembly lock PER KEY, so readers of different projects still scan in
    parallel exactly as the base did: this coalesces same-key readers without making
    any reader wait on an unrelated catalog. That matters because assembly is not
    reliably sub-second -- it can run seconds long on large skills x agents
    catalogs -- so a shared lock would have handed a multi-project burst worse tail
    latency than the base. A test pins the parallelism.

    No work preservation when the leader disconnects: the assembly is awaited
    inline, so cancelling the leader makes the next waiter start over. That buys the
    removal of an in-flight task map and its cancellation bookkeeping.

    The rows are returned as-is, not copied, so a caller that mutates an entry in
    place must copy first.

    Called by :func:`_assemble_skills_catalog`, which awaits it inline while
    holding the coalescing lock -- so a caller that disconnects mid-assembly
    cancels it and the next waiter reassembles.

    Runs the edition capability lookup async (on the loop, non-blocking), then
    offloads ALL blocking filesystem work — kirocrew ``list_skills()`` (os.walk +
    per-file frontmatter reads), package path globs, kiro per-skill resolve/read,
    and the agent annotation — onto the dedicated DISCOVERY pool in one job. This
    work would stall the event loop past the loop-stall watchdog (~25s) on large
    skills×agents catalogs if run on-loop. Use the discovery pool (NOT
    ``maintenance_executor``): this scan is browser-triggerable and can be
    seconds-long, so the maintenance pool would let a few dashboard tabs occupy
    the workers the orphan-reaper sweeps need to recover from a wedge (see
    :mod:`kiro_crew.executors`).

    PRESERVES THE BASE'S RECORDED DEFAULT. The base states, as a decision rather
    than an omission: "No result cache: the endpoint always reflects current
    on-disk state, so freshly created/installed skills appear immediately
    (correctness over the latency a cache would add)." That still holds. Coalescing
    stores no result and has no expiry: concurrent readers share ONE scan, and a
    read that is not part of a concurrent burst always scans current on-disk state.

    Sharing is what admits staleness rather than this function, and
    :func:`_assemble_skills_catalog` is authoritative for that contract. The
    consequence to respect here: do not build a mutation handler that returns this
    catalog expecting the just-written skill.

    all-or-nothing listing: an agent that never customized its skill set
    must not lose access to skills a customized agent's presence would
