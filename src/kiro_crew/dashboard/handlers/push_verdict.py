"""``POST /api/push-verdict/run`` — the gateway side of the prepare-pr push gate.

WHAT THIS ROUTE IS FOR
----------------------
The agent cannot be the one that records "the push guard passed": evidence the gated party
writes is not evidence. So the agent's MCP tool only PRESENTS a request here, and this
handler — running in the gateway process, the same process as the publish floor — performs
the stale-base check itself and then publishes the judged candidate inline. The agent never
holds publish authority: its own ``git push`` is denied by the floor while activation is on,
and nothing persists past the publish, so there is no receipt to record or read back.

MACHINE-only (loopback + ``X-Internal-Secret``), listed in
``server._STRICT_INTERNAL_API_PATHS``. No browser calls it. Both checks are re-asserted
here for the reason ``handlers/computer_use.py`` states about its own legs: being listed in
that frozenset does NOT prove the secret was checked, because with the header absent the
middleware falls through to cookie auth, and a ``local_only=False`` deployment reclassifies
strict paths as mixed.

THE TARGET COMES FROM THE CALLER'S IDENTITY, NEVER ITS BODY
-----------------------------------------------------------
Which worktree the guard runs against is read from the CALLING SESSION's slot, the contract
``handlers/session_ledger.py`` states for its own routes. If the body could name the
worktree, an agent could ask for a verdict about a clean tree and then publish from a
different one — and the verdict would be true, about the wrong repository. The request body
carries nothing this handler trusts.

WHY THE GATEWAY RUNS THE REAL GUARD RATHER THAN ITS OWN CHECK
-------------------------------------------------------------
A verdict that says "the push guard passed" has to mean the push guard passed, so this
handler executes the actual ``prepare-pr`` script,
``builtin_skills/kirocrew-dev/kirocrew-prepare-pr/scripts/push_guard.py``, and records a verdict only
on its exit 0. It deliberately does NOT re-implement the check: that script runs four
(fetch, ancestry, ahead-count, and patch-id replay detection), and a second copy here would
be both a weaker verdict than it claims and a grammar that drifts from the one the skill
actually documents.

Two properties of that invocation are load-bearing.

It runs the PACKAGED copy under ``kiro_crew/builtin_skills/``, never the copy installed into
the user's skills directory. The installed copy is agent-writable, so running it would hand
the gated party the check that authorizes it — the same defect one layer out.

It PINS the base rather than letting the script auto-detect, so the base recorded in the
verdict is exactly the base that was judged. The base is the repository's own default branch
read from the remote's ADVERTISED symbolic HEAD (``git ls-remote --symref``), NOT the current
branch's upstream and NOT the agent-writable local ``refs/remotes/origin/HEAD``: a feature
branch already pushed once has its own remote branch as upstream, and judging staleness against
that is trivially satisfied -- a check that always passes.

The script fetches, which is a network call, and that is correct HERE: this is a tool call
the agent awaits, not the permission gate. The gate itself reads process memory only.

    ``PATH`` is rewritten to a TRUSTED-ONLY value for the git spawn, not merely led with the

    closes the hijack of the git binary itself, but git in turn shells out to helpers --

    the shape an async caller of the chokepoint must keep.

    Routing is the load-bearing mitigation here, not a formality. The command runs against an
    AGENT-WRITABLE repository, and git reads executable directives out of that repository's own
    configuration, so the child must be confined even when it does something the agent chose:
    the sandbox hides the credential directories and hands the child a scrubbed environment, so
    a directive that does execute cannot reach what the gateway can reach.

    ``mode="standard"`` rather than ``"strict"`` because the guard FETCHES: standard is the
    mode documented as hiding non-workflow credential directories while leaving git-over-SSH
    usable. ``visible`` names the directories this spawn must be able to see -- the worktree it
    reads and, for the mirror operations, the gateway's own repository -- so a mask over any
    hidden parent does not also hide them.

    ``gateway_publish=True`` marks this as the one gateway-owned git that KEEPS ``~/.ssh`` even
    when push-verdict gating is activated. On an activated install every agent-influenced spawn
    loses the SSH key so an opaque subprocess cannot push past the argv floor; this path is the
    single operation trusted to publish, so it is exempt from that mask and authenticates over
    SSH as before. Withholding the key here instead would break the gateway's own fetch and push.

    ``writable`` names the directories this gateway-owned spawn must be able to WRITE. The
    gateway's own mirror leaf lives under ``push-verdict-mirrors``, which is a crew-home
    readonly leaf the sandbox seals against every agent subprocess -- so ``git init --bare`` and
    the mirror fetches would fail EROFS and no verdict could ever be issued. This is the one
    trusted spawn that OWNS that mirror, so its leaf is passed as ``extra_writable_dirs``, a
    scoped write carve-out INSIDE the readonly guard (the chokepoint's subtree validator admits

    A remote that FETCHES from one repository and PUSHES to another (``remote.<name>.pushurl``)
    is refused rather than resolved: the gateway judges the tree it can read, and if the publish
    lands elsewhere the judgement describes the wrong repository under an accepted remote name.

    ``pinned_push_url`` is the operator's DESTINATION pin, carried on the activation keystone
    the agent cannot write. Every URL resolved here comes from the AGENT-WRITABLE worktree git
    config -- ``remote.<name>.url`` and the ``branch.*.pushRemote`` / ``remote.pushDefault``

    # closed instead, and it is honest because the expected value is the gateway's own reading.

    # it before the handshake. Residual, stated rather than hidden: the default branch can still
    # advance in the window between that read and this push, and plain ``git push`` has no
    # client-side primitive to bind a ref it does not update -- closing it needs a server-side
    # atomic compare-and-swap the generic remote does not expose. A protected or base-equal
    # source ref was already refused above.
    # The lease value THIS gateway reads protects only against a change AFTER this read -- not
    # against a commit that was ALREADY on the remote feature ref when the gateway sampled it. A
    # collaborator descendant D that arrived between the judging and this ``_remote_tip`` read is
    # adopted as the lease and the force-with-lease against D SUCCEEDS, removing D's commits. The
    # lease alone cannot catch that, so before pushing, refuse when the sampled remote tip holds

    # fast-forward republish) OR an ancestor of the judged base (the rebase/squash case -- the old

    digest was checked and the moment the interpreter opens it.

    The snapshot is refreshed whenever it does not match the pin, which is safe precisely
    because the pin -- not the copy's age -- is what authorizes the bytes. That is what a
