"""HTTP surface of the contribution protocol (§3, §4, §5, §7).

Four routes, all kind-generic -- ``{kind}`` is a path segment resolved against
the ``eventlog.contrib`` unit registry, so a second unit kind is a
``register_unit`` call and not another copy of these handlers::

    GET  /api/eventlog/{kind}/{id}/events?after=&limit=
    POST /api/eventlog/{kind}/{id}/events
    POST /api/eventlog/{kind}/{id}/projections/{key}
    POST /api/eventlog/{kind}/{id}/projections/{key}/schema

Authority comes from the caller's app token and its manifest ``contributions``
declaration, re-derived per request in ``eventlog.grants``. A DASHBOARD-USER
token is refused on every one of these: the gateway's own writes go through the
service directly, so the only legitimate caller here is a contributor, and
admitting the operator's browser would make "the gateway is the only writer"
untrue through a route nothing needs.

Every error carries the contract's §9 machine-readable ``code``.
