class _LockedSectionWrite:
    """One channel's ``config.json`` write, through ``update_config_locked``.

    Every per-channel settings saver in this module merges a staged dict into
    its own top-level section and, when the paired ``.env`` write then fails,
    undoes that merge. This is that step, written once, because each saver is a
    hand-copied credential-write skeleton and the copy is how an unlocked write
    arrives (see ``TestTheAtomicJsonWriteConfigFamilyIsRatcheted``).

    ``apply`` merges ``changes`` into -- and drops ``drop_keys`` from -- the named
    section of the config as re-read INSIDE the sidecar lock, so a concurrent
    edit to an unrelated key is preserved instead of being replaced by the
    caller's older snapshot. The advisory lock on ``<path>.lock`` is what keeps
    another PROCESS (``kirocrew config set``) from landing between the read and
    the write; the in-process ``_get_config_lock()`` the caller holds only
    serializes writers inside this one.

    ``restore`` undoes only the keys this write touched, and only where the
    stored value is still the one it wrote. Rewriting the file from a whole-file
    snapshot would revert whatever a concurrent writer landed; restoring the
    whole section would still discard a concurrent ``kirocrew config set
    <channel>.*`` that arrived between our write and the rollback. A key whose
    stored value differs from what we wrote has been changed by someone else
    since, and reverting it would destroy their edit to undo ours.

    ``seed_from`` names a legacy section (WeCom's ``wechat``) whose COPY becomes
    the starting point when the target section is absent, so an install still on
    the old key keeps its allow-list and thresholds across its first save instead
    of having them shadowed by a bare new section.

    ``drop_keys`` and ``blank_keys`` are the legacy plaintext-credential purge
    (``bot_token`` / ``app_password`` stored in ``config.json`` before the
    ``.env`` slot existed). They are decided against the document the write
    lands on, not the snapshot: a copy a concurrent writer landed after the
    handler's read is purged too, so clearing the ``.env`` credential cannot
    leave a fallback behind that a restart would authenticate with. ``drop``
    removes the key; ``blank`` sets it to ``""`` where present. Both are undone
    by ``restore``.

    ``finalize`` runs on the MERGED section, inside the lock, for a rule that
    couples the written keys to their stored counterparts (a soft/hard threshold
    pair): the pre-lock snapshot the handler validated against may not be the
    document the write lands on, so the coupled check has to be re-decided
    against the fresh one. It may adjust the section or raise; a raise aborts
    the write and propagates to the caller.

    Both run off the event loop through ``drained_to_thread``: the locked
    read-modify-write does file IO and may block on another process holding the
    lock, neither of which belongs on the loop, and a thread cannot be
    cancelled, so a cancelled request must not unwind (releasing
    ``_get_config_lock()`` and skipping its paired ``.env`` write) while the
    worker is still rewriting the file.
