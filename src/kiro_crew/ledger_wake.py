"""Decides whether a conductor's work ledger changed in a way that needs a turn.

The pure half of the ``work-ledger`` watch. It answers three questions about a
conductor's items -- is this revision new, does anything in it need the
conductor, and is the whole goal finished -- and it answers them from values the
caller already holds. Nothing here reads the dashboard, starts a turn or touches
:mod:`kiro_crew.irq` state, so the gate's policy can be tested without a gateway
and a probe defect can never be mistaken for a policy defect.

The generic half is already built and needs no change: :mod:`kiro_crew.irq` owns
state persistence, per-epoch reset, time-bounded dedupe, the coalescing window
and the consecutive-failure backstop, and ``autonudge._monitor_tick_is_quiet``
turns a quiet verdict into a re-arm that spends no model turn.

What this module deliberately does NOT reimplement: the liveness conjunction.
``work_ledger.is_stale`` already requires the staleness window AND a
non-running worker AND a last report that leaves the next move with the worker,
including the case of a ``done`` item its conductor ruled ``verdict: fail`` on
and left open. Restating any of that here would be a second copy of a rule that
already has one.
