"""Warm-session pool state and lifecycle service.

The service owns only pre-spawned providers.  Session registration, cold-start
serialization, background-session creation, and task ownership remain on the
``SessionManager`` facade and are exposed through :class:`WarmPoolOwner`.

Dependencies whose defining namespace is intentionally patchable are injected
as callables.  The facade must supply forwarding callables which resolve those
names when invoked; capturing the current function object at construction time
would break ``kiro_crew.session.*`` patch seams.
