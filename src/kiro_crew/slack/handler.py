"""Message handler — streams LLM responses to Slack with tool approval UI.

Routes incoming Slack messages through hooks, cron command interception,
and the LLM provider.  Supports interactive tool approval via Block Kit
buttons.

Session privacy modes
---------------------
Temporary (blank-slate): no memory reads, no memory writes, no persistence.
    The session starts with zero context and discards everything on close.
Incognito: memory reads allowed but writes blocked; persists an ephemeral
    conversation log that is discarded on close.

Both modes live in :mod:`kiro_crew.messaging.privacy_mode`, keyed by session key,
so a second channel inherits the same machinery; the names in this module are
thin Slack-facing wrappers over it.  Use :func:`_is_slack_restricted` to check
whether a Slack session should skip memory writes.

        #         answer-reached.
        #       * No-stream: the answer is delivered ONLY by the final send, so
        #         answer-reached requires that send to RETURN (not raise). A
        #         truthy placeholder handle is not evidence -- the send itself is.
        #       * No answer text to send (a tool-only turn): nothing to deliver,

    """Tell the model, in-band, that the HOST denied this call -- not the person.

    A rejected permission reaches the model as kiro-cli's fixed "User denied
    tool execution", so without this it reads a refusal that never happened.
    Awaited immediately BEFORE a host-deny ``reject_tool`` in this module: while
    the permission request is unanswered the turn is provably in flight, which
    is what gets the notice queued rather than dropped (``kiro_crew.deny_notice``).
    The Slack handler has two host denies -- a hook ``deny`` on the message
    path (``DENY_CAUSE_POLICY``, the hook's reason) and the approval prompt
    expiring unanswered (``DENY_CAUSE_APPROVAL_TIMEOUT``). *cause* is REQUIRED
    because the wrong noun sends the model the wrong way. The two genuine USER
    rejections (a Deny click in ``handle_interaction``) and the teardown-only
    ``_reject_orphaned_tool`` must NOT call this: there kiro-cli's wording is
    the truth, and "this was NOT a user action" would be a lie.
    ``test_messaging_deny_notice`` walks the file to keep both halves honest.

    *reason* may echo agent-authored text (a hook's reason quotes the matched
    path), so it is redacted here; the shared helper redacts the title.
    Best-effort by construction: ``steer_refusal_notice`` probes the capability
    and swallows every failure, so a backend without a steer channel behaves
    exactly as before and the caller's reject always runs.

    Cancellation mid-steer (teardown) must still answer the wire: a stranded
    ``session/request_permission`` blocks the subprocess forever and wedges
    every later turn behind it. The reject is scheduled as a strongly referenced
    referenced task and awaited through ``asyncio.shield`` so it is stepped
    while this coroutine unwinds; ``_reject_orphaned_tool`` retrieves its
    exception so teardown stays quiet. *audited* is REQUIRED and says whether
    the caller wrote the decision's SEL row BEFORE this await (the hook deny
    does) or writes it after the wire (the approval-timeout arm, whose
    caller audits both outcomes once the request is answered). The orphan
    reject audits only in the second case: the SEL ledger is append-only,
    and a decision already on it must not gain a second row nothing
    reconciles.
