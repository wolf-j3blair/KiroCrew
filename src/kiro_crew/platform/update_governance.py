"""The update seam: where new code may come from, and the minimum version.

Two enterprise pins, read from the trust-root ``security_policy.json`` (see
``governance.UpdatePins``), applied at the three places KiroCrew replaces its own
code: ``POST /api/update``, ``kirocrew update``, and the unattended gateway-boot
auto-apply. This module exists so those three share one implementation and
cannot drift.

Deliberately NOT a governance archetype: a remote URL and a version number are
values the core consumes, not "is X permitted?" decisions, so they need no
``SCOPE_CATALOG`` row, no matcher, and no evaluator change.

**A pin blocks; an unresolvable pin does not.** If governance cannot be read at
all the update proceeds — refusing one would strand a host on a build that may
need a patch, and the pins are a routing constraint, not a security boundary
against a local operator who could edit the checkout directly.

    Membership in :data:`PRIMARY_BRANCHES` is the entire test. That is a design
    constraint, not an omission: this gate gates the most privileged path in the
    product — a boot-time ``git reset --hard`` + ``pip install`` + ``execv`` with
    no auth and no click — and it is also the path the enterprise ``min_version``
    floor drives (``_auto_apply_update`` is what a mandatory update calls on a
    checkout). So the decision must not read any state a local process can write.

    ``refs/remotes/<remote>/HEAD`` is exactly such state: one
    ``git remote set-head`` repoints it. Consulting it fails in BOTH directions,
    and there is no ordering that fixes both —

    * Obeying it as authoritative lets a repoint aim the install at an arbitrary
      branch of the still-approved origin, so unreviewed code gets installed and
      executed. The source pin cannot catch that: the remote URL is unchanged.
    * Letting it merely narrow (accept only when it agrees) turns the same
      one-command repoint into a veto — point a ``main`` checkout's pointer at
      ``mainline`` and the host silently stops updating, including for a
      mandatory floor, stranding it below the administrator's minimum version.

    A fork whose primary line is named something else entirely therefore gets no
    unattended update, only the badge. ``kirocrew update`` and the dashboard
    apply path still serve it, and both have a human in the loop — the
    difference that makes wider trust acceptable there and not here.

    A wrong literal here fails SILENTLY — the gate returns and the host simply
    never updates — which is what a hardcoded ``!= "mainline"`` did to every
    ``main`` checkout of this repo for three months. The allowlist is the fix for
    that: it names every primary line this project's clones actually use, so no
    single name has to be guessed right.

    ``git update-index --assume-unchanged`` / ``--skip-worktree`` tell git to stop
    checking a path, and git obeys them thoroughly: for an edited
    assume-unchanged file both ``git status --porcelain`` and ``git diff --quiet
    HEAD`` report a CLEAN tree, while ``reset --hard`` still overwrites the file.
    That makes it the one tracked-file loss the work-tree refusal cannot see --
    verified end to end, edit destroyed.

    Read-only by construction. The documented remedy, ``update-index
    --really-refresh``, does surface the edit, but it WRITES the index: a check
    whose only purpose is to decide whether mutating the checkout is safe must not
    mutate it to find out, and doing so unattended would also silently disturb the
    developer's own index state.

    Instead the flagged entries are enumerated (``ls-files -v``, where a LOWERCASE
    tag means "not checked") and each one is hashed and compared with the blob HEAD
    records.

    The hash lets git apply the path's attributes, and deliberately does NOT pass
    ``--no-filters``. That flag suppresses git's BUILT-IN conversions as well as
    external ones, so under ``core.autocrlf`` -- the normal Windows posture -- an
    UNMODIFIED file hashes differently from its blob (working CRLF vs stored LF)
    and this check would refuse every such checkout. Verified: with
    ``--no-filters`` an untouched file mismatches, with attributes applied it
    matches and a real edit is still detected. Letting attributes apply is safe
    here precisely because a repository declaring a filter driver is refused
    before this runs (:func:`repo_exec_config_reason`), so no external program can
    be reached through it.

    Returning only paths that ACTUALLY differ matters: flagging every
    assume-unchanged entry would refuse the update for anyone who uses the bit for
    local config overrides, which is the silent no-op this whole change exists to
    remove.

    a LONE SURROGATE (``b"\\xff"`` becomes ``"\\udcff"``). A surrogate cannot be
    encoded to UTF-8, so interpolating one into a log record raises
    ``UnicodeEncodeError`` inside the handler. ``logging`` does not propagate that

    *upstream* is taken as given — pass the SAME revision the reset will use,

    concurrent fetch advance the ref, report zero commits ahead of the NEW tip,
    and still reset to the OLD one — discarding exactly the commits the count was
    supposed to protect. Counting against the reset target closes that.

    This exists because the two checks that look like they cover it do not.
    ``git status --porcelain`` reports working-tree edits, not commits, and the
