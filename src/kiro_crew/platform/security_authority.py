"""The ADD-only PolicyAuthority — the deny-floor security invariant.

The un-weakenable deny floor is **ADD-only at the contract boundary**: a
companion or plugin may *add* deny patterns but can never remove or weaken it.
Under the user-configurable-denied-commands model the floor is composed of two
things, **neither** a static built-in pattern list:

* the companion's ADD-only :class:`SecurityOverlay` — structurally un-removable
  because :meth:`PolicyAuthority.is_denied` and
  :meth:`PolicyAuthority.effective_patterns` are ``@final`` and the overlay is
  union-only (there is no method that subtracts from or replaces it); and
* governance ``commands``-scope **pins** — loaded from ``security_policy.json``
  and applied tightest-wins in ``governance.py`` (not visible to this module).

The built-in ``security.BUILTIN_DENY_PATTERNS`` are **not** part of the
un-weakenable baseline: they are the DEFAULT-ON but USER-DISABLEABLE tier,
filtered per-call via the ``denied_regexes`` regex tier and enforced at
``hooks.py``'s PreToolUse gate.  ``BASELINE_DENY`` is therefore the empty
tuple — the static OSS floor carries no pattern.

:func:`assert_security_floor` (called at boot) consequently guarantees only the
ADD-only overlay contract: that the authority is a :class:`PolicyAuthority` and
has not overridden the ``@final`` decision methods.  It does not assert a
built-in superset or probe git-publish, because those rules are
user-disableable.

The actual deny evaluation (two-pass, git-publish verb anchoring, SEL audit)
still lives in ``security.py`` and is reused verbatim — the overlay patterns
flow through the existing ``extra_patterns`` parameter (never filtered by user
opt-out), and the disableable regex tier flows through ``denied_regexes``.

See ``docs/system-specs/modules/platform-context.md`` (Security floor section).
