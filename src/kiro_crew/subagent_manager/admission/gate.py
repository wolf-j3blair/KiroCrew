        Approval priority (first match wins):

        1. YOLO mode → immediate execution
        2. ``approval_mode="auto"`` from caller → immediate execution
        3. parent session trust (``approval_policy == "auto"``, the dashboard
           Trust toggle) → auto-approved execution
        4. ``auto_approve_subagent_spawn`` config → auto-approved execution
        5. ``on_spawn_approval`` callback → interactive approval, unless the
           callback reports it has no surface to raise the prompt on, in which
           case the spawn is refused immediately (see
           ``_spawn_with_approval_impl``)
        6. Otherwise → rejected

        When ``approval_mode="auto"`` is set, it has two effects:
        - Skips the spawn approval gate (this method)
        - Sets the subagent's session-level tool approval policy to
          "auto" in ``_run_inner()``, meaning all tool calls within
          the subagent are auto-approved for its entire lifetime.

        This dual behavior is intentional for headless callers (e.g.
        Mochi bg agent) that have no UI to respond to approval prompts.
        The parameter is only accepted via the internal ``POST /api/spawn``
        endpoint (requires X-Internal-Secret), not from LLM tool calls.

        Args:
            task (str): The prompt/task description for the subagent.
            parent_session_key (str): Session key of the caller.
            agent (str): Agent name override (default: "kirocrew").
            model (str): Model override for CC provider (ignored for ACP).
            reasoning_effort (str): Per-call reasoning-effort override; wins
                over the ``role_efforts['subagent']`` pin. ``""`` defers to it.
            allowed_tools (list): Tool allowlist for CC provider (ignored for ACP).
            bare (bool): Launch CC in bare mode (ignored for ACP).
            cwd (str): Optional absolute path where the subagent subprocess
                launches instead of the default ``subagent_<id>`` sandbox.
                Validated against ``AgentConfig.subagent_cwd_allowed_roots``;
                rejected spawns return a done ``SubagentInfo`` with ``error``
                set. Enables cwd-relative resource globs (``AGENTS.md``,
                ``.kiro/steering``, ``CLAUDE.md``) to resolve correctly.
            approval_mode (str | None): "auto" to skip spawn gate and
                set session-level auto-approve.  Only honored from
                authenticated internal callers (X-Internal-Secret).
            silent (bool): Suppress completion notifications.

        Returns:
            SubagentInfo | None: Agent metadata, or None if at capacity.

        """PIN the parent session and turn that asked for *info*. Writes nothing.

        Called from both accepted exits of ``spawn`` and from neither rejection.
        Pinning here and writing elsewhere is deliberate: this is normally the only
        moment the ASKING turn is knowable -- a spawn arrives as a tool call inside
        the parent's turn -- but being accepted is not being started. Registration
        is followed by the spawn approval gate, and a decline returns through
        ``_claim_finalize`` + ``_safe_announce`` without ever reaching ``_run``, so
        an entry written here would be an opener nothing closes. The entry is
        written by ``_log_spawned``, the one site that means the run is really
        starting, from the pin this leaves behind.

        ``asked`` overrides that reading, and one caller needs it: a queued
        follow-up is DISPATCHED by its watcher after the run it continues has
        finished, so no turn is asking at this moment and the parent may be on an
        unrelated one. That caller pinned the asking ordinal where the follow-up was
        requested and hands it in; without it the continuation would be filed under
        a turn that did not ask for it. A caller that supplies no ``asked`` is
        dispatching from inside its own turn, where the live reading is correct.

        ``from_queue`` marks a member re-entering under the same id after the
        stagger or concurrency gate held it, and the pin it was accepted with must
        stand. ``remember_child_origin`` is what keeps it: it refuses to move an
        origin already in the map. What that map does not survive is a restart, and
        the durable queue replays a queued row into this site in a process whose map
        is empty -- so the pin is re-established on that pass rather than skipped,
        or the child's spawn, steer and terminal entries are all omitted with
        nothing to report the gap. The turn is left UNOBSERVED there: the turn that
        asked died with the process that recorded it, the parent's live turn names
        one that did not ask, and the writers omit an unobserved ordinal rather
        than stamping a turn that never existed.

        Best-effort throughout. A spawn must not fail because a log entry could
        not be pinned, and an unresolvable parent yields an empty session id, which
        the pin refuses -- leaving the later write with nothing to open, which is
        the correct outcome rather than a guessed one.

        Every name is imported inside the body on purpose. This method does NOT
        end in ``_impl``, so ``bind_component_globals`` leaves it running on this
        module's own globals -- where the facade's imports, ``logger`` included,
        exist only under ``TYPE_CHECKING``.
