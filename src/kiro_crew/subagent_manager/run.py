        Every ``state.json`` writer inside a run goes off the loop and is
        drained through :meth:`_drain_state_writer_impl`, entering here or, for
        the run's ending, through :meth:`_write_finished_result_off_loop_impl`,
        for two reasons that are both load-bearing.

        OFF-LOOP, because ``update_state`` ends in a synchronous fsync and a
        slow FS must not freeze the gateway/heartbeat. Running in a pool
        thread also means the write TAKES ``update_state``'s per-agent lock,
        which off-loop callers hold and on-loop callers deliberately skip.

        DRAINED ON CANCELLATION, because cancelling a ``to_thread`` await
        detaches the worker without stopping it, and ``update_state`` rewrites
        the WHOLE file from the snapshot it already read — so a detached worker
        rolls back every field written after that read, not merely the fields it
        names. That is how a zombie erases the ``pid`` / ``session_id`` a
        cancel-respawn recovery run writes on the loop, or the retention
        ``keep`` that promote / release write on the loop.
        Cancellation is therefore held open until the worker finishes — but
        BOUNDED: ``cancel_all()`` gathers run tasks with no timeout, so an
        unbounded drain on a wedged FS would hold gateway shutdown forever, and
        this module's convention is that bounded shutdown plus recoverable state
        beats unbounded shutdown (same posture as ``_REPORT_DRAIN_TIMEOUT``).
        ``asyncio.wait`` never cancels its members, so repeated cancels of the
        awaiting task keep the worker future intact while the drain loop waits
        out the same deadline. For the whole window in which the worker may still
        write -- from the cancellation until the worker settles, however the drain
        exits -- the run HOLDS its conversation
        (``SubagentManager._abandoned_state_writers``), so the two on-loop
        ``keep`` writes are deferred past the worker instead of being rolled back
        by it. The window starts at the cancellation rather than at the drain
        deadline because on Python 3.10 a second outer cancel can finalize the run
        mid-drain.

        Returns ``update_state``'s own report: True when the merge was written,
        False when it was SKIPPED because the state was unreadable — a caller
        with a durability contract (the pre-spawn provenance write)
        retries on False. Re-raises ``asyncio.CancelledError`` after draining,
        so such a retry loop ends on cancellation instead of adding a second
        writer for the same fields.

        completed ending, ``None`` any other ending. ``update_state`` is handed
        over from this namespace, the seam the run's other state writes go
        through.

        Bounded by ``_STATE_DRAIN_TIMEOUT`` even when nothing cancels it. A
        claimed ending is ``done`` to every stop, so a Stop, a reap or a parent
        end cannot cut this wait short, and ``_run``'s ``finally`` caps after
        the run's cancellation was consumed; unbounded, a wedged FS would hold

        detached, under the same hold a cancelled drain takes, and False is

        A sub-agent whose declared server failed to start, is still waiting to be
        authorized, or was never configured simply does not see its tools. Nothing
        told it so: the report the session already accumulates had only
        dashboard-slot readers, so a spawn's own servers were reported to the one
        surface a spawn does not have. The run then learns the tool is absent the
        slow way -- by searching for it until its turn budget is spent, which is
        the reported harm.

        Two different strings, on purpose. The LOG gets the reasons -- a person
        fixing a server's startup needs them. What is RETURNED for the model drops
        them (``include_reasons=False``): a reason is the failing server's own
        startup output, so in the OAuth and network cases it can carry remote
        content, and no scrubber neutralizes a natural-language instruction. The
        return value exists at all because the log reaches the operator, and the
        operator is not the one hunting for the tool.

        Silent when the report is clean, and silent when the provider keeps no
        report (the contract's documented default), so a healthy spawn adds
        nothing anywhere. A report is never worth failing a run over, hence the
        broad catch: the run continues either way and only the notice is lost.

        One reading, at session establishment. A frame that lands after the init
        drain gives up -- a slow server, an authorization request raised mid-turn
        -- is not re-checked here, so this names what was known at spawn and does
        not claim to be a live view of the session's servers.

        Reaches the report through the provider contract, never an import of the
        ACP layer: the agent-SDK boundary gate refuses application code that edge,
        and ``problem_summary`` is declared on ``SessionMcpReport`` so this needs

        and it says what to do instead of searching -- a run told only that
        something is wrong still probes.

        The directive is per BUCKET, not blanket. A failed or unconfigured server
        will not appear in this session, so retrying it only spends turns. A server
        AWAITING AUTHORIZATION is the opposite case: the report models it as

        exists to trigger, so the notice keeps it open.

        The names are FENCED as untrusted data, and the fence tag carries a
        per-spawn random nonce. A server name is chosen by whatever config
        declared it, so it is text this process did not author, and the one thing

        that closer is a no-op too, so the pair is all-or-nothing by

        The entry goes in the PARENT's log, under the turn that asked for the

        that can carry it, and the asking turn comes from the dispatch pin rather
        than the parent's live turn: a person can take an unbounded time to
        answer, by which point the parent is very likely on an unrelated turn.

        The origin comes through ``child_origin``, the gated reader, not the
        ``dispatch_origin`` the spawn gate uses. A prompt raised mid-run happens
        after the child's ``subagent/spawned`` opener exists, which is the state
        the gated reader is for; the spawn gate needs the ungated one precisely

        ``done`` and every wake refused from there, so the run's result can never
