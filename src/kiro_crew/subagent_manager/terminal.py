        closed twice however the race between the reaper and ``_run``'s ``finally``
        resolves.

        The closer is chosen from the runtime's own three-way ``outcome`` and never
        re-derived from error-nullability: ``completed`` closes as a completion, and
        ``stopped`` and ``failed`` both close through ``subagent/failed`` carrying
        which one it was. A stop is not a success and must not read as one, and it
        is not an error either.

        The parent session and the turn that asked are read back from the origin
        pinned at the dispatch, and released here -- the parent is very likely on a
        different turn by now, and asking which one would file this outcome under a
        turn that did not cause it. An unknown origin means the dispatch was never
        recorded (the flag was off then, or the parent could not be resolved), and
        the emitter's empty-session-id no-op drops the closer rather than inventing
        an opener for it.

        Returns True for exactly one caller. Both the reap path and ``_run``'s
        ``finally`` call this and report only if it returns True, so the parent
        is notified exactly once no matter which wins the race or whether the
        loser is cancelled part-way through its teardown. One exception: a run
        whose stream died under a reap's own reset (the reap-echo arm) does not
        claim at all -- the reap does, after its fallback kill has decided, so
        the report it publishes carries a kill that failed (see ``_run``).

        Contains no ``await``, so on a single-threaded event loop the
        check-and-set is atomic with respect to other tasks.

        Returns False while ``_recovering`` — a cancel-recovery respawn is
        pending and the agent must not be reported done yet — leaving the claim
        OPEN so the respawned run can take it later.

        ``supersede_recovery=True`` overrides that withholding and is used ONLY
        by definitively-terminal callers (`_force_reap`, which also serves user
        Stop). Without it a reap landing inside the recovery window stranded the
        outcome: the reap was refused the claim, performed teardown and set
        ``reaped``, reported nothing — and `_resume`'s ``reaped`` abort path
        bare-returns, so no path ever reported and the agent sat unfinished
        until the reaper's wall-clock deadline. Superseding also clears
        ``_recovering``, because a killed agent has nothing left to respawn.

        Scope note: this token governs REPORTING only, and it deliberately does
        NOT consult ``info.done``. Gating it on ``done`` is wrong:
        if ``_run_inner`` set ``done`` while the reap awaited its session reset,
        the reaper refused the claim, still marked ``reaped``, and ``_run``'s
        finally then skipped its own claim — nobody reported. The terminal RECORD
        (tombstone/stat) keeps its own ``not info.done`` guard and slot accounting
        has its own one-shot token (:meth:`_release_slot`); three concerns, three
        guards. Session teardown stays keyed on ``reaped``.

        This is the exact work the finalize claim guards: fire the
        ``subagent_done`` WS event, then inject the completion into the parent
        (``_on_done``) with its ``_ON_DONE_TIMEOUT`` cap, timeout handling, and
        (for the ``_run`` path) the result.txt TTL / workspace-cleanup
        bookkeeping.

        Why this is a separate coroutine run under ``asyncio.shield`` (see
        ``_run_terminal_report``): the claim makes reporting EXCLUSIVE but not
        ATOMIC. A claimer cancelled mid-report (``_force_reap`` /
        ``cancel_all()`` cancelling the task while it awaits ``_fire_event`` or
        ``_on_done``) would exit without delivering, and the other path — seeing
        the claim already taken — stays silent, so the completed outcome never
        reaches the parent. Running the report on a shielded, strongly-held task
        makes it complete independently of caller cancellation.

        ``gate`` is for a caller that spawns this report BEFORE the record is
        final -- ``_force_reap``, ahead of the reset and kill awaits it may be
        cancelled at -- so the task exists, strongly held and drained by
        ``cancel_all()``, before any point the caller can be cancelled at. The
        report waits on it: ``True`` once the caller holds the finalize claim
        and the record is written, and the payload is built from ``info`` only
        then; ``False`` when the claim went to another path, which reports, and
        this task returns without a word (its caller disowns it from
        ``_report_owners`` before releasing it, so its exit latches nothing).

        The two call sites (reap vs. ``_run``'s ``finally``) differ only in the
        injection-timeout reason string, the log ``source`` prefix, and whether
        a successful delivery marks the result delivered — those are passed as
        arguments rather than unified away. The WS payload is identical (both
        set ``info.elapsed`` before calling), so it is built from ``info`` here.

          whose own reset popped it and hung too), and each is a process of its
          own. Each entry is a :class:`kiro_crew.session_lifecycle.TornDown`

          and the reap recorded ``reaped`` over it. An entry of another shape (a

          pops it (:func:`kiro_crew.process_identity.process_handle_of`).

        reset, and a reap that raised here would stop nothing and record nothing.
        The session objects are what ``kill_set`` compares the reset's pop
        against: a popped session with no pid that this snapshot already named
        is nothing to kill, one it never saw is a cold start still spawning.
