        outlives the run's ``_agents``/``_tasks`` records: a dashboard "clear
        completed" or "cancel" pops both of those for a run that is done but still
        tearing down, so inferring "record gone means child gone" would tombstone a
        live child. No gate entry means teardown has finished (or never started).
