    ``spawn_continue`` re-seeds the session map from the run's ``state.json`` to
    resume it after a restart. "No result was captured" therefore under-tells:
    the parent re-spawns from scratch and pays for the same tool calls twice.

    The hint is offered only when the conversation is actually resumable by the

    present and the ``{sid}.jsonl`` holding a turn; for any other backend the

    refuses typed if the session is gone). A pruned, released or never-started

        A subagent qualifies only once it has actually entered execution

        (``_pid is None``), had no answer on its own session
        (``_first_stream_started``, see ``_leave_startup``) and produced no turn
        (``turns == 0``) within ``_startup_deadline`` seconds. A provider can
        create its child lazily from ``stream()``, so a missing PID alone is not
        evidence that startup has not progressed; an opened stream is not
        evidence that it has. Keying on
        ``_exec_started`` — not the registration timestamp ``started`` — means
        an agent merely awaiting spawn approval (never entered ``_run_inner``)
        is never caught here.

        The deadline is the fixed ``_startup_deadline`` however many other
        agents are in startup, and the clock it is measured on PAUSES while the
        run is queued for a start-queue permit: at queue entry
        ``_gate_wait_mark`` stamps ``_gate_wait_started``, which stands in for
        *now* here, and at acquisition ``_gate_exit_reset`` adds the wait to
        ``_start_queue_wait_ms``, which is subtracted. The dedicated path pauses
        at all three start queues (cold-start semaphore, spawn admission,
        ``session/new`` gate), the shared path at the ``session/new`` gate and,
        while it waits for the parent's companion runtime
        (``START_QUEUE_COMPANION``), at that runtime's per-parent lock and its
        spawn's admission; the companion spawn's own work runs on the clock. So
        the clock measures time spent STARTING since ``_exec_started`` -- never
        time queued behind other starts -- and the in-startup population is
        bounded separately by ``_startup_cap`` at admission. The paused total is
        bounded too, by :meth:`_start_queue_saturated_secs`. The deadline does not grow with the
        population: a term sampled at sweep time against a clock spanning the
        whole crowded period would not be monotonic -- it would shrink as the

        Reads the samples the reaper sweep already takes (``_sample_live_costs``,
        every ``_REAPER_INTERVAL`` seconds) — this method itself does no ``/proc``
        work, so it is safe on the event loop. ``rss_mb`` is 0.0 until the first
        sweep observes the agent, which is why ``sampled`` is reported separately:
        a fresh task genuinely has no measurement yet, and rendering that as
        "0 MB" would be a lie.

        ``shared`` mirrors ``_session_sharing``: the value is that runtime's
        measurement divided by the number of concurrently-live sharing sessions
        on the same pid, i.e. an average share, not an exclusive figure. The same
        split applies to ``procs``/``mcp`` (see ``_attributed_count``), which are
        null until a sweep has counted them — a task row that reported no MCP
        stubs because the field was simply absent read as "subagents do not use
        the MCP pool", which is the opposite of what they do.
