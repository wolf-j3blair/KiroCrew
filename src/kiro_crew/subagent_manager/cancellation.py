        """Respawn *info* on a fresh task after a recoverable terminal event.

        The default serves an unexpected cancellation. ``context_overflow``
        serves a first-turn overflow and forces the replacement onto a fresh
        dedicated runtime after the original attempt's handle (shared) or
        process (dedicated) has finished teardown.

        The current task cannot continue itself, so the replacement runs on a
        new task. Each caller owns its one-shot gate. The original run's finally
        block still performs session cleanup but skips terminal finalization
        while ``_recovering``.

        **Cancellation-source contract.** This branch exists for cancellations
        that arrive from OUTSIDE the manager's own lifecycle — in practice the
        parent task tree being torn down around a live subagent (e.g. a
        dashboard slot reset/removal cancelling background tasks, or an event
        during gateway component re-init) — mirroring the main path's
        unexpected-cancel recovery. Every INTENTIONAL cancel site in
        this module sets a terminal marker before cancelling, and the recovery
        branch defers to all of them: ``cancel()`` sets ``user_stopped``,
        ``cancel_all()`` sets ``_shutting_down``, and ``_force_reap`` sets
        ``reaped`` (checked before the recovery branch). Any NEW code path that
        cancels a subagent task on purpose MUST set one of those markers first,
        or the cancel will be treated as unexpected and recovered once.

        Coordination is explicit, not timed: ``_resume`` awaits the ORIGINAL
        task object to fully complete (its finally does session release/reset,
        slot decrement, and pops the task registry) before respawning. This
        guarantees the old finally can neither pop the new task out of
        ``self._tasks`` nor emit a duplicate completion, and the respawn never
        starts against a session whose reset is still in flight. The respawn
        then re-acquires a slot by waiting for capacity (the old finally's
        ``_drain_queue`` may have admitted a queued spawn into the freed slot),
        so the concurrency ceiling is never exceeded.

        The pending ``_resume`` task itself is registered in ``self._tasks``
        (under ``"<id>:recovery"``) so ``cancel_all()`` reaches it during
        shutdown — a recovery can never outlive or escape manager teardown.

        not by a clock: a wall clock stepped back during the teardown would
        stamp the successor's row before the snapshot.

        Stop all: that verb's terminal report goes back to a parent the user is
        still looking at, and is the point of it. At a parent end the parent is
        gone, so each run is marked and the delivery gate in
        ``_report_terminal_impl`` drops the injection. The kill itself is the same

        #     which CREATES a session when none is live, and never re-reads the mark. So

        #     run's report is dropped holds only for a run the snapshot did name.

        # recheck added at either end leaves the other open. Selecting or re-testing needs
        # an await, and after an await, work belonging to the retired conversation looks
        # like work a successor under the same key has just started -- telling them apart
        # needs a conversation-incarnation counter the session layer does not have.

        Every row's store cancel runs in ONE job on the store's writer thread
        (``taskq_post_cancel_queued``), never on the loop: a cancel on the loop
        holds it for the store's busy timeout, once per row, whenever the store
        is contended.

        An id registered as a run after the ids were read (the store read is an
        await) is left out of the job: it is a live run, which the running sweep
        after this pass reaps, and cancelling its row would end it under the run
        and fence out the run's own settlement.

        The job is queued and the window entries are dropped before this method
        first suspends, so a stagger timer finds no entry to start, and a refill
        or a claim queued after the job lands behind the cancels and finds the
        rows cancelled. A refill fetch queued BEFORE the job is the caller's to
        fence (``cancel_for_parent`` holds the parent in ``_stopping_parents``).
        The job is queued first so that a post that raises leaves every entry in
        the window: nothing was cancelled, and nothing is reported stopped.

        The answers are applied by a tracked task that the caller awaits through
        a shield. Once the job is queued its cancels land whether or not the
        caller is still waiting, and a row cancelled in the store without a
        queued-stop report would leave its wave waiting for a completion that
        never comes.

        Until that task has reported a row, the row is in neither ``_queue``
        nor ``_agents``, and nothing on the loop says a cancel of it is on the
        way. Every id of the job is filed in ``_batched_stops`` for that span,
        and the two readers that would otherwise act on the row join its answer:
        a single ``cancel`` (``cancel_impl``), which would report the row itself
        and leave the batch, finding the row already cancelled, to report a
        popped one again; and a claim whose post-claim re-read answered before
        the cancel landed (``claim_and_start``), which would register the row
        as a run the cancel then ends under it, counted once as queued and once
        as running. Each id's parent (*parent_session_key*, whose rows the ids
        are) is filed beside it in ``_batched_stop_parents``, for a third
        reader: a parent-end teardown's snapshot
        (``snapshot_teardown_children``), which reads ``_queue`` and
        ``_agents`` and would otherwise leave the batch's report of each row
