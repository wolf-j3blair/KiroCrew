"""Feishu (Lark) client -- wraps lark-oapi for async-compatible send/receive.

Inbound: lark-oapi ``ws.Client`` runs in a daemon thread and pushes
normalized ``LarkInbound`` frames into the async event loop via
``asyncio.run_coroutine_threadsafe``.

Outbound: ``send_reply`` wraps the sync lark-oapi REST API in
``run_in_executor`` so it never blocks the event loop.

``lark-oapi`` is an OPTIONAL dependency: it ships in the ``feishu`` extra, and
is installed on its own with ``pip install 'lark-oapi>=1.4,<2'`` (this project
is not on an index, so ``pip install kirocrew[feishu]`` cannot resolve).
It is imported lazily inside this module's methods so that every other module
in the package -- including :mod:`kiro_crew.feishu.transport` and the channel
roster in :mod:`kiro_crew.channels` -- imports cleanly on a build that does not
have it. ``maybe_start_feishu`` catches the resulting ``ImportError`` and skips
the channel with a log line rather than failing gateway boot.
