"""Layer 1 -- Feishu (Lark) as a concrete :class:`MessagingTransport`.

Wraps the low-level :class:`LarkClient` (WebSocket receive + REST reply)
in the channel-neutral transport contract, so the Feishu channel rides the
shared ``TurnDriver`` (credential/exfil redaction + tool-approval ladder +
SEL audit) instead of a hand-rolled turn loop.

Dependency direction is ``feishu -> messaging`` (allowed); the neutral
``messaging`` package never imports ``feishu``.

Security: :meth:`authorize` is **deny-by-default** and owner-only.  An empty
``allowed_open_ids`` MUST authorise nobody (fail closed), never everybody.
Group-chat access is an explicit opt-in gated on both ``allow_group=True``
AND the group's ``chat_id`` appearing in ``allowed_group_ids``; every other
context (unknown group, or a group chat when ``allow_group`` is False) is
denied with a SEL audit record.
