        Unlike consolidate_session() which is fire-and-forget, this awaits
        completion. Used by the CLI command.

        Passes repeat until the tail is drained. One pass renders at most
        :data:`_CONSOLIDATION_PROMPT_BUDGET_CHARS` (see
        :func:`_consolidation_chunk`), and the CLI process exits when this
        returns — there is no idle sweep behind it to pick up a remainder the
        way there is for every in-gateway entry point. A single pass would
        therefore report a tail larger than the budget as fully consolidated
        while most of it was never read.

        The loop stops on the first pass that consolidates nothing, not only on
        an empty tail: a refusal, an unreadable transcript, or a span that the
        marker cannot advance over all leave the count where it was, and
        repeating them is an infinite loop rather than progress.

        Returns ``False`` when the first pass was refused by the consolidation
        retry backoff — so the CLI can report the skip instead of a false
        success — and ``True`` for every other outcome (including the
        nothing-to-do and sensitive-session skips, which were already reported
        as done). A partial drain that then stalls returns ``True``: work did
        happen, and the caller reports the remainder from its own count rather
        than from this flag.

        Safety: the sensitive-session check runs before the first pass and
        again before every later one, because a live session can append a
        sensitive tool event between passes and the drain would otherwise
        prompt a tail the first check never saw. It is not enforced inside
        _consolidate(): the idle sweep deliberately consolidates a sensitive
        session for memory. The consolidation retry backoff is re-checked in

        Unlike history/semantic/lesson extraction — which correctly runs on the
        incremental unconsolidated tail — skill detection judges the last
        ``_SKILL_DETECTION_WINDOW`` messages of the WHOLE session, decoupled
        from the consolidation offset. A reusable procedure usually spans a
        session rather than the slice since the last consolidation, so a
        tail-only view systematically misses skills in any session consolidated
        more than once. The skill need only be demonstrated by PART of the
        window; the pass does not have to cover the whole session.

        Runs as its own LLM call so the consolidation prompt stays tail-scoped
        (widening THAT prompt would re-summarize already-consolidated messages
        into duplicate history/semantic entries). A per-session
        (rotation_generation, count) guard skips re-running when nothing new has
        been appended since the last pass, yet still forces a fresh pass after a
        transcript rotation (which swaps the window's content); genuine repeats
        are still caught by the dedupe verdict in ``_process_auto_skills``.

        The prompt gates on RECURRENCE, not effort. A session can be long,
        difficult, and rich in tool calls while still being one-off — a single
        bug's fix, a one-time audit of one component, a probe answering a
        question that is now answered — and the tool-call floor
        (``auto_min_tool_calls``) cannot tell those apart from a repeatable
        method. So the prompt makes the model name the future session and the
        DIFFERENT target that would reuse the procedure, and return null when
        the only honest answer reuses this session's own artifact. It also
        prefers null under uncertainty: an unreusable candidate is not free,
        because it spends the human's review attention on every later proposal.

        real standing rule is the costlier mistake.

        ``checked_value_json`` is the ``value_json`` the tier was read from, so an
        allowed delete can COMPARE-AND-DELETE against it: ``_lesson_key`` keys on
        rule text plus scope alone, so a delete-plus-re-add is the documented way
        to change a tier and can put a standing rule under the same key between
        this read and the delete. Passing the checked body as ``expect_value_json``
        makes the delete a no-op when the row moved, closing that race without a
        lock this call site cannot hold. It is ``None`` for a protected decision
        (no delete follows) and for a non-lesson key (which the caller deletes
        unconditionally, its existing contract).

        nothing and must not, or a broken host would abandon spans it never read.
        An exception (rather than a flag beside the result) is used so a caller
        cannot silently drop the distinction.
