    The path is resolved exactly ONCE and the resolved object itself is returned,
    so the caller materializes the very path these checks judged. Resolving a
    second time after the checks would follow a parent swapped for a link in the
    meantime, and the pinned create can only refuse a swap that happens AFTER the
    path it is handed was resolved.

    ``expanduser()`` FIRST is what makes this honest: ``config_dir() / "~/x"``
    silently yields ``<home>/~/x`` — contained, but it creates a literal ``~``
    directory the user never asked for and quietly ignores the tilde they wrote.
    Expanding first means a tilde path is judged as the absolute path the user
    meant, so it is refused with the same clear message as ``/tmp/x`` (matching
    how the dashboard handler reads the same field).

    The test is CONTAINMENT, not "is it absolute": an absolute path that lands
    inside the data home is accepted (it resolves to the same place the relative
    form would, so there is nothing to refuse). What is rejected is anything
    resolving OUTSIDE — which is the property the boundary actually protects.

    STRICT descendant, so the root itself is refused HERE, in the one place
    that expands ``~`` -- the earlier per-call-site root checks compared
    ``config_dir() / ws_dir`` unexpanded, so ``~/.kiro/crew`` slipped past them.
    A workspace pointed at the data-home root would put agent-writable
    memory/lessons on top of ``config.json`` / ``.env``.

    Inside the home is NOT automatically safe: the keystone paths live there too
    (``profiles/``, ``security_policy.json``, ``admission_policy.json``,
    ``denied_commands.json``, ``.env``, ``sel_hmac.key``…). ``--copy-from`` runs
    ``copytree(..., dirs_exist_ok=True)``, so a workspace dir of ``profiles``
    would OVERWRITE the governance ceiling the agent is specifically forbidden to
    write — the one mechanism that makes that ceiling un-disableable. So the
    resolved target must also clear ``is_sensitive_path()``, the shared gate used
    everywhere else for exactly this question.

    Fails CLOSED on any path we cannot resolve. ``expanduser()`` raises
    ``RuntimeError`` for a ``~unknownuser/...`` prefix (no such user, so no home
    to expand), and ``resolve()`` can raise ``OSError`` on a pathological path —
    both must return None and route into the normal refusal, never escape as a
    traceback. That is the whole point of this PR, so the guard cannot be the one
    thing that crashes.

    skill files, and ``_register_app_crons_to_scheduler`` writes through the
    shared cron store that the gateway's timer tick re-syncs by content digest.
    Backend hooks are Python modules imported INTO the gateway process, and only
    the gateway can replace them (``on_app_enable`` ->
    ``RouteRegistry.register_app_routes`` -> ``load_app_module``, reached by the
    HTTP enable route and by ``on_gateway_startup``). This CLI process has no
    handle on that one's ``sys.modules``, so it cannot load them directly --
    and it does not need to: the gateway runs a hook reconciler
    (``apps/hook_reconcile.py``) that notices an on-disk hook change this CLI
    made and reloads it in-process within a poll interval. A
    stopped gateway loads the new code on its next start.

    states the actual timing so an operator does not verify a hook change against
    stale code and draw the wrong conclusion.

    """``kirocrew cron add``: validate every field, then ONE locked ``add_job``.

    The CLI is a thin front-end over ``CronService.add_job`` -- the same single
    writer the dashboard POST, the MCP ``cron_add`` tool and the apps SDK
    converge on. Every field is resolved here and handed to that one locked
    build+persist, so the job lands on disk fully-formed. The old shape --
    ``add_job`` with a subset, then ``job.agent_id = ...`` / ``job.silent = True``
    and a second, unlocked ``svc._save()`` -- was a data-loss window: the bare
    save could clobber a job another writer had appended between the two
    writes, and a crash between them left a job missing its agent.

    Job kind is exactly one of agent (the default), ``--script`` or
    ``--command``; schedule is exactly one of ``--every``, ``--cron`` or
    ``--at``. Schedule/timeout coupling is split by who can see it: when both
    ``--timeout`` and ``--timeout-secs`` are given, ``_build_job`` at the
    persistence owner validates the pair and the CLI surfaces its
    ``ValueError``; when ``--timeout-secs`` is omitted the CLI passes ``0``,
    which ``_build_job`` reads as "no wake budget given", so the CLI itself
    checks ``--timeout`` against the default wake budget it knows will apply.

    A ``--script`` file must already live under ``<config_dir>/crons/``
    (``resolve_script_path`` enforces containment) -- the CLI registers, it
    does not stage. Script bodies and shell commands go through the same
    storage-time security vet the MCP tool and the apps SDK apply
    (``_vet_script_file`` / ``_vet_shell_command``). The gateway re-vets at
    fire time regardless, so this is fail-fast for the caller, not the only
    guard: a job that would be refused at every wake is refused once, here,
    with a non-zero exit, instead of being stored and silently never running.

        #    loop. Closing it needs one primitive that ALL ~29 writers take, which is
        #    its own change, not this feature.
