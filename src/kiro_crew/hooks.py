# site fires one and no other reader consumes this tuple. That is why they are a
# separate tuple rather than new members of ``HOOK_EVENTS`` -- an event in that
# tuple carries a promise that something calls ``fire`` for it, and these carry
# none.
#
# "No event fires them" is not "the command cannot run": the dashboard's Test
# endpoint runs a STORED hook's command on demand and never consults this tuple
# (``handlers/hooks.py`` ``api_hook_test`` -> ``run_script_hook``), so Test works on
# one of these exactly as it does on a fired event.
#
# They are not equidistant from running, and a reader planning the delivery side
# needs the difference. A Kiro Agent requests hooks by trigger name over ACP from
# a fixed set of seven (``acp/kas_wire.py``'s ``ACP_HOOK_TRIGGERS``), and only
# ``preTaskExecution`` and ``postTaskExecution`` are in it; the file and manual
# triggers are absent, so a Kiro Agent does not ask for those four at all today.
#
# Where the six names come from, since no call site here fires them: each is the
# PascalCase rendering of a trigger name Kiro's own hook schema carries, so the
# delivery round maps a documented name rather than inventing one. Kiro documents
# both spellings of each -- the ``when.type`` name a legacy hook file uses, which
# is also the ACP spelling for the two above, and the standalone v1 hook-file
# trigger -- at kiro.dev/docs/ide/whats-new-v1/hooks:
#
#   preTaskExecution  -> PreTaskExec        postTaskExecution -> PostTaskExec
#   fileCreated       -> PostFileCreate     fileEdited        -> PostFileSave
#   fileDeleted       -> PostFileDelete     userTriggered     -> (none)
#
# Two consequences for the delivery round. It has two vocabularies to map, not
# one, and the names here match the left column. And the manual trigger is the
# furthest from arriving of the six: it has no v1 equivalent at all, so an
# existing manual hook stays runnable as a legacy one while a new one cannot be
# authored in that schema -- the Test button is its whole run path here.

        """Check if a tool should be auto-approved, denied, or handled normally.

        ``tool_name`` is the display title/pill label. For shell tools it may
        be an LLM-authored ``description`` string rather than the literal
        command (``select_tool_title`` in ``acp/_dispatch.py`` prefers
        ``description`` over ``command``), so it is UNTRUSTED for security
        decisions. When the caller has the raw executable command it MUST pass
        it as ``command=``; every security check then also runs against the
        real command, closing the bypass where a benign title/description hid
        a dangerous command (``auto_deny_tools`` and the sensitive-path /
        credential-read protections both keyed off the title otherwise).
        Over-blocking is the safe direction: a match on EITHER the title or the
        command denies. Auto-approve stays keyed on the title only — failing to
        auto-approve merely falls through to interactive approval.

        The optional keyword-only ``session_key`` / ``agent`` / ``app`` identify
        the calling surface so the governance ceiling ∩ active-profile can be
        resolved and a tool/MCP call denied even when the kiro agent config
        granted it (the governance headline behavior).  They default to ``""`` so
        every existing caller is unaffected; a caller that supplies identity opts
        into per-surface governance.

        ``tool_kind`` (the ACP semantic kind: ``read``/``edit``/``fetch``/…) and
        ``raw_params`` (the real tool arguments — ``path``/``url``) let the gate
        enforce the path/host scopes a display title cannot carry
        (``filesystem.write``, ``network.egress``).  Both default to empty, so a
        caller that does not thread them only loses those two arg-derived scopes,
        never the title-derived ones.  ``raw_params`` additionally feeds the deny
        tiers a synthesized ``file-search …`` target (``_search_deny_target``) for a
        search-shaped call, whose walked root and depth cap exist ONLY in its
        arguments; a caller that omits ``raw_params`` loses that coverage too.

        ``diff_path`` is the path the tool call's ``{"type": "diff"}`` content
        block named (``event.diff_path``, cached by ``acp._dispatch`` per scoped
        toolCallId). A nonempty ``diff_path`` is itself write-plane evidence —
        the cache is written only when a tool_call frame declares a file
        change — so the write-protected tier judges any call carrying one (or
        declaring the ``edit`` kind) by the UNION of the params' path
        spellings and this path, and denies an empty union: a backend may
        stream params that carry no path key and name the file only in that
        block, so the params alone can judge nothing
        (mirroring ``llm_helpers._edit_target_denial``). Defaults to
        ``""``: a caller that does not thread it keeps params-only judgement of
        edits, and an edit-kind call that carries params (any dict, ``{}``
        included) or a diff block but names no path is denied rather than
        passed unjudged. Only ``raw_params=None`` with no ``diff_path`` falls
        through — such an edit has nothing to judge here and keeps the other
        tiers' coverage, exactly like ``_edit_target_denial``, which an edit
        with no params never reaches.

        ``is_shell`` enforces deny-by-default for shell tools: when a caller
        reports a shell tool (``is_shell=True``) but cannot supply the raw
        ``command`` (extraction failed — e.g. malformed params), the title
        alone is not a trustworthy basis for a decision, so the call is DENIED
        rather than silently falling through to the title-only checks. Callers
        that always pass a resolved command can leave ``is_shell`` at its
        default; those forwarding an event should pass both the command and the
        event's ``is_shell`` flag.

        ``mcp_server_name`` is the NON-model-authored MCP server identity from
        the ACP event's ``_meta.kiro.mcpServerName`` (``AcpEvent.mcp_server_name``),
        set by kiro-cli ONLY for MCP-served tool calls and empty for shell /
        built-in tools. It is the trusted discriminator "this call was genuinely
        served by MCP server X" — as opposed to the LLM-authored ``tool_name``
        title, which a prompt-injected agent can forge (e.g. titling a Bash call
        ``mcp__<app>:srv__x``). The app-own-server auto-approve keys on THIS, never
        on the title, so a forged title cannot win an auto-approval. Empty (the
        default, or a backend that omits ``_meta.kiro``) fails closed: no match.

        ``mcp_tool_name`` is the sibling NON-model-authored tool identity from
        ``_meta.kiro.toolName`` (``AcpEvent.tool_name``). Despite the name it is
        NOT MCP-only: kiro-cli sets it for every tool call it serves, built-ins
        included, and sets ``mcp_server_name`` only for MCP-served ones. It is
        therefore evaluated on the deny and governance planes whenever present,
        server or no server -- otherwise a built-in's real name (``fs_write``)
        reaches no check at all and a deny/ceiling rule naming it is bypassable
        behind a benign model-authored title. With both present the
        gate reconstructs the canonical ``mcp__<server>__<tool>`` name and runs
        the effective deny set AND the governance ceiling against it as well as
        against the title — because the ``tool_name`` title above is LLM-authored
        prose (``select_tool_title`` prefers the model's ``description``) and may
        not carry the canonical form a per-tool MCP policy matches on. Without
        this, an ordinary MCP call whose policy-denied tool arrives under a benign
        description would pass the gate and reach the human prompt, where an
        "allow" would run a tool the ceiling forbids.

        The canonical name is ADDED to those checks, never SUBSTITUTED for the
        title: the two carry different security signals. The canonical name is
        the trusted statement of WHICH MCP tool is being invoked, and is what a
        per-tool ceiling or deny rule matches. The title and raw command carry
        the path, command and content signals that a tool identity does not
        express — ``~/.aws/credentials`` read through an innocuously named MCP
        tool is denied by the title, not by the identity. Different dimensions,
        so a deny on EITHER denies the call. Empty (no ``_meta.kiro.toolName``)
        means the tool cannot be identified, so the own-server auto-approve does
        NOT fire (fall through to interactive approval — fail-closed).

        ``classifier_only`` drops the two GRANT tiers — the operator's
        ``auto_approve_tools`` globs and the app-own-server rule — so the only
        auto-approve left is the read-only classifier's, which carries
        ``read_only=True`` on the result. A grant vouches for the caller and
        says nothing about the call's effect; ``ToolApprovalPolicy.READ_ONLY``
        (the side chat) has no approver behind it, so a grant honoured there
        would execute a mutating tool. Every deny tier and governance still
        run, and a call a grant would have approved is classified on its own
        merits instead of being refused outright. Default ``False``: a caller
        with an interactive approver keeps the grants.

        Under the flag the classifier also tightens WHAT counts as proof: with
        no approver to catch an over-approval, read-only must follow from
        HOST-TRUSTED facts alone — the recovered shell ``command`` judged by
        ``is_read_only_bash``, or a built-in the host knows to be read-only,
        named by the non-model-authored ``mcp_tool_name`` with no
        ``mcp_server_name`` (``_HOST_READ_ONLY_BUILTIN_TOOLS``) AND carrying
        ``mcp_identity_trusted``, the provenance flag saying that pair came
        from the ``_meta.kiro`` parse this client made of the tool_call frame
        (``AcpEvent.mcp_identity_trusted``) rather than from an inline payload
        or a hand-built event — without it a host-known name is unproven and
        refused. The agent-influenced inputs — the ACP ``tool_kind`` and the title —
        may NARROW (a non-read kind refuses) but never prove, so a mutating tool
        labelled ``kind="read"`` or titled ``Read …`` is not auto-approved; an
        MCP-served tool, which carries no host-trusted read-only marker, is not
        provable either. Off the flag the interactive path keeps its ACP-kind
        allow-list and title fallback unchanged.

    The twin of :func:`_unc_agents_root`, and it exists for the same reason.
    ``data_home()`` is cheap only on its *default-home* branch: with
    ``KIROCREW_HOME`` set it calls ``_valid_override_home()`` FIRST, on every
    call, and that does ``Path(override).expanduser().resolve()`` --
    filesystem I/O, and on a UNC-shaped override an SMB touch. ``config_dir()``
    memoizes, but that memo sits BEHIND the predicate, so it never covers this.
    Measured at this PR's head: three ``protected_ref_spans()`` calls produced
    three resolves of the override.

    That is the one configuration this gate has to be fast in. A roaming
    profile is exactly when ``KIROCREW_HOME`` points at a share, so the
    per-call resolve lands on the host whose latency the gate promises never to
    depend on -- and :func:`unc_probe_allowed` is reached from
    ``iter_local_refs``, which ``telegram.renderer._rotate_on_length`` runs
    INLINE on the event loop against a documented 7-15 us/KB budget.

    Resolves through :func:`peek_data_home`, NOT :func:`data_home`: this module
    primes the memo at import time, and ``data_home()`` on a first resolution
    delegates to ``config_dir()`` -- ``mkdir`` plus the recovery-breadcrumb
    write. The gate only needs to know WHERE the root is (a path-prefix trust
    check), so importing this module must not create directories or write
    breadcrumbs -- that maintenance belongs to ``ensure_data_home()`` at process
    start. ``peek_data_home()`` applies the SAME override predicate, so reader
    and writer agree on the root, and reads nothing else.

    Memoized on the RAW ``KIROCREW_HOME`` value plus the accessor identity and
    the resolved-home cache the default branch reads -- so an env change, a
    monkeypatched accessor or a reset of the resolution cache all invalidate
    naturally.

    A computation failure memoizes ``None`` (root absent, gate stays total),
    for the reason :func:`_unc_agents_root` gives: the failure being avoided is
    a per-call resolve that can block on an SMB timeout, and the degraded state

        ``extra_hooks`` run after the stored ones, through the same matcher, gate
        and spawn, and are never persisted: they belong to the caller (an agent
        spec's own ``hooks`` on a backend that cannot run them, see
        :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.spec_hooks`), not to this store. They run in
        ``extra_hooks_cwd`` -- the session's workspace, where the harness that
        would otherwise run them runs them -- and their payload's ``cwd`` says so.
        ``tool_match_names``, when given, are every name the call is known by (its
        title, its canonical tool name, its ``@server/tool`` form); a tool matcher
        then matches when it matches any of them. ``tool_name`` stays what the
        payload says.

        For PreToolUse/PostToolUse, matcher filters by tool name. When
        ``extra_hooks_tool_names`` is given, an extra hook's tool matcher is
        compared with those names instead: the tool's identity in the vocabulary
        the extra hooks were written in, which ``tool_name`` (the call's title)
        does not carry. It matches when any name does, and an empty sequence
        leaves only an unscoped (``*``) extra hook matching. The first name is
        also the ``tool_name`` an extra hook's stdin payload reports, so a script
        that branches on it reads the same vocabulary its matcher is written in.
        For AgentSpawn/UserPromptSubmit/Stop, all hooks for that event fire.

        Optional ``subagent_id``, ``parent_session_key``, and ``agent_role`` are
        emitted into the hook_event payload so hook scripts can attribute tool
        calls to the specific agent/session that fired them. Parent contexts
        (dashboard chat, generic LLM helpers) leave them as ``None``.

        For the Stop event, the full ``context`` (the final assistant segment) is
        used for matcher evaluation and echoed to stdin as ``assistant_text``;
        only the ``KIROCREW_HOOK_CONTEXT`` env var is length-capped downstream in
        ``run_script_hook`` (ARG_MAX safety), so a hook keying on the tail of the
        segment reads it from stdin JSON rather than the truncated env var.
