    The task runner's single reject funnel: every ``reject_tool`` in this module

    (``test_taskrunner_deny_notice`` walks the file to keep that true).

    *cause* is REQUIRED and says whether the HOST refused this call. A rejected
    permission reaches the model as kiro-cli's fixed "User denied tool
    execution"; for a host deny that is a refusal that never happened, and the
    model abandons or routes around a call nobody objected to. So a host cause
    (``DENY_CAUSE_POLICY`` for a hook or policy verdict on the call itself,
    ``DENY_CAUSE_SURFACE_POLICY`` for the unattended run refusing every
    un-trusted call) steers the in-band notice through ``llm_helpers``'
    ``_steer_host_deny`` BEFORE the reject -- while the permission request is
    still unanswered the turn is provably in flight, which is what gets the
    notice queued rather than dropped (see ``kiro_crew.deny_notice``). ``None``
    is the explicit verdict that this is NOT a host deny and must stay bare:
    the interactive handler said no (kiro-cli's wording is then the truth, and
    "this was NOT a user action" would be a lie), or the turn is being torn
    down for a mid-stream compaction and re-run, so there is no continuing turn
    for a notice to correct. A caller has to write one or the other; there is
    no default to inherit the wrong answer from.

    The SEL row is written FIRST, before the steer and the reject, as on every
    other deny surface: the steer is one more bounded await on the ACP pipe, and
    a backend that stops reading stdin cancels this coroutine at the turn
    deadline with the decision acted on and never audited if the row came last.
