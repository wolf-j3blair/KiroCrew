"""Observe one conductor's work ledger: the domain half of the wake gate.

A conductor today re-reads its ledger on a timer and spends a model turn to find
out that nothing moved. This probe answers *what does the ledger look like right
now* so :mod:`kiro_crew.irq` can decide, and a tick where no worker said anything
the conductor must act on costs no turn at all.

The split is deliberate and matches :mod:`kiro_crew.probes.gh_pr`. Everything
generic -- state persistence, epoch reset, time-bounded dedupe, the coalescing
window, the consecutive-failure backstop -- is the kernel's. Every POLICY
question -- which statuses need the conductor, which event kinds a worker can
even write, how many wakes one item may cause -- lives in
:mod:`kiro_crew.ledger_wake` as pure functions. What is left here is the reading
itself, which is the only part that needs a disk.

Two facts this probe cannot read for itself and takes as values instead:

* ``worker_running`` -- whether a worker's slot has a turn in flight. That lives
  in the dashboard's in-process slot table, which a probe running on a worker
  thread has no handle on, so the driver injects a resolver.
* ``worker_closed`` -- whether that slot is GONE. Same table, same reason, and a
  separate question: "not running" is true of a worker thinking between turns as
  well as of one that ended, which is why ``is_stale`` makes the first wait out a
  window and lets the second skip it.

Both default to the safe direction rather than to nothing: an absent resolver
reads as "not running" and "not closed", which can only make the gate LOUDER (a
stall wake the conductor did not need costs one turn) or later, never quieter
about a worker that stopped. The opposite default would turn a missing handle into
a watch that never reports a stalled worker, which is the failure this gate exists
to remove.

#: This probe's subject kind. Defined HERE rather than in ``probes/__init__``, which

#: same boot-path reason; the two must stay equal.
WORK_LEDGER_KIND = "work-ledger"

#: Events read per item per tick. The kernel masks a repeat by key, so the tail
#: only has to be long enough that a BURST between two ticks is not missed: a
#: worker that reports ``blocked`` and then ``progress`` before the next tick must
#: still wake its conductor on the ``blocked``. Reading only the newest event
#: would drop exactly that transition. Matches the kernel's own list bound.
_EVENT_TAIL = 8

_STALL_KEY = "stall"

#: The one terminal item state that means the item's bar was MET. The other two
#: (``rejected``, ``abandoned``) close an item without meeting it, so a ledger is
#: only a success when every item ended in THIS state. Pinned against
#: :data:`~kiro_crew.work_ledger.TERMINAL_ITEM_STATES` by a test, because a rename
#: there would otherwise make every finished ledger read as a failure in silence.
ACCEPTED_STATE = "accepted"

#: Dedupe key for "the whole goal is finished, and every item's bar was met". One
#: per subject, since a watch that ends has nothing further to say. PUBLIC because a
#: driver records success or failure from a probe's own terminal keys, so this kind's
#: key has to be nameable from outside: read through the pull-request vocabulary
#: instead, a conductor whose every item is closed reads as not-merged and is
#: persisted as blocked.
ACCEPTED_KEY = "all-accepted"

#: Dedupe key for "the whole goal is finished, and at least one item was NOT
