"""The macOS Seatbelt profile a sandboxed agent spawn runs under.

:func:`_build_seatbelt_profile` renders the ``sandbox-exec`` profile text: a read
deny over each masked tree (with the private windows and the exposed files carved
back out), write and hardlink denies over the trees whose writes matter, and the
approved write carve-outs last, because Seatbelt is last-match-wins between an allow
and a deny. ``kiro_crew.sandbox`` writes the text to ``<config_dir>/run`` and wraps
the command in ``sandbox-exec -f <profile>`` (``sandbox_exec_argv``).

``kiro_crew.sandbox`` re-exports the builder and its template under their old names,
and a patch of either through ``kiro_crew.sandbox`` lands here.
