"""AcpSessionHandle — one multiplexed ACP session on a shared runtime.

Split out of ``runtime.py`` to keep the two responsibilities in separate files:

- ``session_handle.py`` (this file): the per-session API surface — one
  ``sessionId`` + its ``asyncio.Queue``, the prompt/cancel/approve/reject event
  loop, and the per-session stale/stall watchdog. Depends only on the runtime
  *protocol* (``AcpRuntimeProtocol``), the shared dispatch parser, and the ACP
  types — never on the concrete ``AcpRuntime``.
- ``runtime.py``: ``AcpRuntime`` — owns the subprocess + single-reader demux and
  constructs handles.

The runtime exceptions (``AcpRuntimeError`` / ``AcpRuntimeDead``) and the
``AcpRuntimeProtocol`` live here (the lower layer) so ``runtime.py`` imports them
from this module without a circular import; ``runtime.py`` re-exports them so
existing ``from kiro_crew.acp.runtime import AcpSessionHandle`` call sites keep
working.

        The poison sentinel tells a waiting turn only THAT the runtime died;
        the runtime's ``death_summary()`` (reason + returncode + stderr tail,
        composed at ``_mark_dead`` time) says who/why. Field experience: three
        unattributed mid-turn deaths in five days were undiagnosable from the
        bare message alone. ``getattr``-guarded so a minimal runtime double
        without ``death_summary`` degrades to the bare message.

        A death whose retained stderr shows a throttled dynamic registration
        returns the typed transient subclass instead of the generic death — but
        only while this session has seen NO text chunk and NO tool call
        (``prompt_or_tool_seen``). A stale throttle line surviving in the ring
        past real work must not hand the retry ladders a transient verdict for
        a session whose replay could repeat side effects. The tail is read as
        LINES (``redacted_stderr_tail``), because the summary folds them behind
        a prefix that a per-line signature cannot match — the same reason the
        sandbox corroboration reads it. The typed message keeps one retained
        cause instead of the tail's repeated copies.

        A stdin-stall death is never re-attributed to a throttle: the host
        knows why the runtime died, and the transient verdict would license
        replaying a prompt the live child may still read. It carries
        ``ambiguous_delivery`` when this session's prompt was outstanding

        See ``ACP_BACKENDS_STEERING_REQUEST`` for what was measured. The adapter

        only delivery evidence. It is awaited until it arrives, the turn it was
        aimed at ends, or ``_STEERING_ANSWER_WAIT_SECS`` pass, whichever is first;
        the bound exists because the dashboard composer awaits this call inside a
        send request the browser aborts.

        * ``injected`` -- True is returned, which means accepted, not consumed:
          the caller keeps its pending entry for the text. The answer stays
          registered with the turn it was aimed at, whose dispatch loop proves it
          was read before the terminal (at a between-frames point with nothing
          buffered, see :meth:`_take_injected_steers`) and reports it as
          ``EVENT_STEER_CONSUMED`` only when that turn ends cleanly and this call
          has already returned True (see :meth:`_release_proven_steers`). A turn that ends on a denied approval,
          a cancel, a refusal or an error reports nothing, and the caller's
          teardown queues the pending text, so a steer codex dropped with its
          turn runs again instead of being lost. An ``injected`` answered after
          its turn ended returns False.
        * ``startedNewTurn`` -- no turn was running by the time the adapter looked,
          so it began one that no ``session/prompt`` of ours owns. That turn is
          cancelled and False is returned, which sends the caller down its queue
          path: the text runs once, as the next turn Crew starts itself.
        * ``failed``, an error answer, or an answer of any other shape -- False, and
          the caller queues it.
        * the turn ends before any answer -- False, and the caller queues it. A late
          ``startedNewTurn`` is still cancelled.

        This is at-least-once, not exactly-once. codex-acp guarantees no ordering
        between the steering answer and the prompt's terminal, and ``injected`` is
        an ack that the text entered the turn's input, not a consumption receipt.
        When the terminal is read first, or is already buffered when the answer
        is looked at, or the turn ends in a way that may have dropped the text,
        the steer is not reported consumed and the caller queues it, so a steer
        codex did act on in that window runs a second time -- visibly, as its
        own turn. That is the requeue path's documented cost
        (``_requeue_unconsumed_steers``), preferred to the silent loss the
        opposite choice produces.

        The ``is_turn_active`` and ``_prompt_written`` checks are what keep
        ``startedNewTurn`` rare: a steer is only sent once a prompt of ours has been
        written and is still in flight, so the adapter can only start a turn of its
        own when ours ends inside the request's round trip, and never while our
        prompt is still being built.

        Nothing is sent while the turn is parked on an approval. codex answers that
        request ``injected``, but its only reject option cancels the turn and drops
        what was injected with it (see ``ACP_BACKENDS_STEER``), so a steer settled
        there would be reported delivered and never run. Returning False sends it
        down the queue path instead, and it runs as the next turn. The same goes
        for a steer past ``_MAX_STEERING_TEXT_CHARS`` or while
        ``_MAX_STEERING_ANSWERS`` are held (the cap counts unanswered, abandoned

        A cancelled turn is NOT a completed compaction, and this is the arm where

        AND stops retrying. The turn reaching its own end boundary is the whole
        evidence an inline harness offers, so the absence of that boundary has to
        withhold the answer.

        The test is POSITIVE -- the stop reason must BE ``end_turn`` -- rather than
        "not cancelled". Excluding cancels alone accepts every other way a turn can
        fail to finish: a refusal, a token limit, a stop reason this build does not
        recognise, or a turn that never reported one at all. Each of those means the
        compaction did not run, and each would otherwise be reported as a success.

        ``_cancelled`` is checked as well as the reason, because a cancel that never
        got an ack leaves the reason empty while the flag is already set -- and an
        unacked cancel is exactly the case where the compaction is least likely to
        have run. Both are THIS class's own turn state, so they are read directly
        here -- the sibling on ``AcpProvider`` asks
        ``AcpClient.turn_finished_cleanly`` instead, because there the state belongs
        to the client and reading it across that boundary would decide a
        compaction's fate from a shape the provider does not own. Both reads keep
        ``getattr`` defaults that fail CLOSED, so a handle built without a turn --

        This is the read-path counterpart: revalidate the snapshot BEFORE the
        picker trusts it to hide anything.

        ``catalog_ids`` is the full ``--list-models`` catalog (the ids the picker
        would offer unfiltered). The verdict of what to keep/drop is NOT decided

        picker endpoint applies, built on ``model_is_unusable`` (the single
        spelling of "what this account can run") and ``resolve_pin_spelling``.
        This method only decides WHETHER
        the snapshot is trustworthy enough to narrow with, and reuses the existing
        :meth:`refresh_available_models` heal path when it is not (no second
        probe, no second parser).

        Staleness heuristic (a scheduling decision, never an entitlement one):
        probe only when the snapshot would actually narrow the catalog (some row
        drops and the endpoint does not fail open to the full catalog) AND one of

        * it was never probe-confirmed, or
        * it was captured within ``_READ_PATH_SPAWN_RACE_SECS`` of runtime spawn
          (the exact window the degraded answer is resolved in), or
        * it advertises only ``auto`` against a richer catalog — the strongest
          staleness signal.

        Rate limit: a probe is skipped when this session probed on the read path
        within ``_READ_PATH_REPROBE_MIN_INTERVAL_SECS`` AND the snapshot is either
        probe-confirmed or not auto-only, so a hot poll does not re-probe on every
        runtime TTL expiry forever. An UNCONFIRMED auto-only snapshot is exempt
        from the interval — it always gets to probe — while a probe-CONFIRMED
        auto-only snapshot (a genuine free-tier account really is ``auto``-only)
        honours the interval like any other rather than re-probing forever. The
        runtime's own single-flight probe TTL bounds the cost of the exempt case.

        Fast path: the probe runs as a single in-flight task per handle, shielded
        under ``_READ_PATH_PROBE_DEADLINE_SECS``. On deadline expiry this RAISES
        :class:`EntitlementRevalidating` while the task KEEPS RUNNING to
        completion — so its throwaway probe session is cleaned up and a later
        read serves the corrected list, and the endpoint returns its degraded
        response (rather than serving the un-revalidated snapshot as a live 200
        the frontend caches). A subsequent read while the same task is still in
        flight awaits it too, so it never bypasses the raise. A probe FAILURE

        MCP children — NOT just a local queue unregister. Without the terminate,
        a finished session's state stays resident in the multiplexed process
        forever, so RSS climbs with cumulative sessions (the background-runtime

        dead or slow runtime -- but see the `finally` below for the one

        Each session on a shared runtime (a ``_bg`` op or a session-sharing

        ``owns_runtime=True`` → ``runtime.kill()`` and intentionally keep their
        transcript for ``session/load`` resume, so cleaning up here is safe.

        Exception: ``keep_transcript=True`` (set by SubagentManager before

        resume material for ``spawn_continue`` and are lifecycle-managed by the

        """Release the tracked consult and swap in a fresh, configured oracle.

        Both boundaries that drop the evidence baseline — turn start in
        ``prompt()`` and each new tool dispatch — retire rather than
        ``reset()``, because ``_consult_oracle_offloaded`` submits a BOUND oracle
        method to ``subprocess_executor()``: a walk whose await already timed out
        keeps running and keeps a reference to the instance it was handed. Samples
        are keyed ``"io"``/``"cpu"`` with no PID, so clearing in place lets that
        late writer repopulate the baseline the next generation reads, and since
        any nonzero delta counts as movement a flat tick then reads WORKING.

        The tool path has a second, sharper version of the same hazard that the
        capture path does not: ``_check_shell_child`` matches a descendant against
        the *dispatched* command and stores it as ``_tracked_child`` for exact
        exit detection on later ticks. A walk carrying the PREVIOUS tool's
        ``ToolCallState`` therefore writes a child of the previous command into
        the live oracle, and the new tool's next tick reports
        ``WORKING "shell child N alive"`` on a process that has nothing to do with
        it. Retiring confines both writes to an instance nobody reads.

        Retirement is not a semantic change for the cross-tick tracked-child
        contract itself: ``fresh()`` starts with exactly the state ``reset()``
        produced (no tracked child, no grace timestamp, no samples), and the
        consult resolves ``self._oracle`` at submission, so every tick after the
        boundary binds and accumulates on the new instance the way it did before.

        The future must be retired TOGETHER with the oracle. Replacing only the
        oracle would leave a walk wedged in the previous generation answering
        every later tick "prior consult still in flight", so the new generation
        would never sample its own process — the tool branch would then run on
        UNKNOWN and end a healthy tool call at the suspect window.

        Releasing the future costs at most one abandoned worker per boundary
        instead of one per tick. ``fresh()`` rather than a default construction so
        the per-session ``wellness_sample_secs`` (and an injected /proc root or
        clock in tests) survives the swap.

        Parity with AcpClient._drain_notifications. During session setup there is
        no in-flight prompt, so every frame on this session's queue is an
        init-time notification. Draining them here keeps them out of the first
        turn's event stream and gives MCP servers a window to report in before
        the first prompt races ahead.

        The idle shortcut means "quiet AFTER the servers reported", not "quiet,
        therefore done": until the first MCP registration frame (initialized /
        init_failure / oauth_request) is observed, queue silence is treated as a
        server still booting and the drain keeps waiting, bounded by
        ``no_report_ceiling`` (defaults to ``_MCP_DRAIN_NO_REPORT_CEILING``,
        resolved at call time so tests can shrink the module constant). Once a
        report has been seen, the drain allows up to ``duration`` more and exits
        after ``idle_exit`` seconds of silence, so warm sessions — whose
        registration frames were staged during session/new — arm immediately and
        pay no extra latency. ``config_option_update`` frames refresh cached
        configOptions; OAuth requests remain drainable via
        ``pop_pending_oauth_requests``; everything else is logged/discarded.
        Best-effort — never raises.

        ``stale_report_frames``: how many frames on the queue describe the roster
        that initialized during ``session/new``. For a session whose mode was
        then SWITCHED via ``set_mode``, that is the PRE-switch agent's roster,
        and the switched-to agent's own servers may still be booting. Those
        frames are still drained and processed normally; they just neither arm
        the idle shortcut nor enter the report.

        The COUNT is the caller's to measure, and it must be read before the
        ``set_mode`` request goes out — the only moment "already queued" and
        "pre-switch" mean the same thing. Measuring it here instead would count
        the switched-to agent's own registrations, which the backend can emit
        before it answers set_mode, and consume them without recording: a
        session left at a false "no report" for as long as its servers keep

        Called at the turn's terminal. ``None`` -- the ordinary case -- means no
        codex compaction was in flight, or one was and it already reported.

        The verdict is ``failed``, and that is the opposite of what the claude
        twin synthesizes. The two harnesses differ in what a MISSING terminal
        means. claude-agent-acp sends its ``Compacting completed.`` text only for
        a MANUAL ``/compact``; an automatic mid-turn compaction takes a different
        path and emits no text at all, so for claude a turn that ends naturally
        after a ``started`` is evidence the compaction finished. codex-acp sends
        its terminal for BOTH -- the capture shows the marked
        ``tool_call_update`` on a manual ``/compact`` and on a native
        ``model_auto_compact_token_limit`` compaction alike -- so here a missing
        terminal is evidence the compaction did NOT finish. Reporting
        ``completed`` would reset the context meter against a window nobody
        summarized.

        One arm for every *reason*, unlike the claude twin, and for the same
        reason the verdict differs: this is not an inference from how the turn
        ended, it is the absence of a frame codex always sends on success. A turn
        cancelled mid-compaction did not compact either.

        Three things it deliberately does NOT do:

        * reset the context counts -- nothing was summarized, so the pre-compaction
          numbers are still the true ones;
        * arm the post-failure budget (``_compaction_failed_at``) -- that budget
          exists to bound a wait for a turn that may never end, and this runs AT
          the end of the turn, so arming it would charge the NEXT turn's idle
          clock for this one's failure;
        * claim the failure is retryable. ``last_compaction_transient`` is set
          False because an inferred failure carries no reason to classify, and
          False is the value that does not promise a user a retry will help.

        The title is text this module authors, not text a backend echoed, so it
        needs no redaction -- and it is there so the surfaces that render a
        failure reason stop collapsing this case to "unknown error".

        The runtime-side twin of ``AcpClient._codex_compaction_event``, and the
        one that runs for a live codex session: codex is a member of
        ``ACP_BACKENDS_ACP_RUNTIME``, so its frames arrive here. Both
        implementations answer rather than one, because a capability the two
        transports disagree about is a capability that works on whichever one a
        reader did not test (harness-parity H6).

        It applies the same state mutation the compaction branch above applies on
        a kiro-cli ``completed`` -- drop the stale context counts so the meter
        resets -- and returns the ``EVENT_COMPACTION_STATUS`` every consumer
        already handles. That is what lets ``compact()`` capture a terminal while
        draining its own prompt turn, so ``wait_for_compaction()`` answers from
        the cache instead of waiting for a notification codex never sends.

        Takes the already-extracted *update* rather than the message, because the
        caller has validated it is a mapping and belongs to THIS session -- a
        child-routed frame returns earlier, so a native subagent's compaction can
        never reset the parent's meter.

        Gated on ``ACP_BACKENDS_INLINE_COMPACTION`` rather than on codex's identity,
        which is the sanctioned spelling on this path and also the useful one: the
        set names the harnesses whose compaction lands INSIDE the prompt turn, and
        a frame like this is what landing inside the turn looks like. A harness
        that earns that membership inherits the translation by joining the set,
        with no edit here. claude is a member and is unaffected -- it reports
        compaction as prose and stamps no marker, so the parser declines its
        frames -- which is the point: the MARKER decides, and the set only bounds
        who is asked.

        No ``failed`` arm exists because codex-acp sends no such status: a
        compaction that errors leaves the ``session/prompt`` request unanswered,
        which the turn deadline owns, so nothing here arms the post-failure budget
