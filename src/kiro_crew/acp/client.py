"""ACP client — JSON-RPC 2.0 over stdio with `kiro-cli acp` or `claude-agent-acp`.

Protocol (ACP JSON-RPC 2.0):
  initialize → session/new → session/set_mode → session/set_model → session/prompt
  (claude backend: no agent activation via set_mode -- its modes are permission
  modes, not agents -- and session/set_config_option for model)

Agent selection: ``session/set_mode`` with ``modeId`` activates the agent
config (prompt, tools, resources).  MCP servers are passed explicitly
in ``session/new`` via the ``mcpServers`` parameter.

Permission flow:
  ← session/request_permission (server→client REQUEST with uuid id)
  → {result: {outcome: {outcome: "selected", optionId: "allow_once"}}}

# ── deepseek (ACP_BACKEND_DEEPSEEK) ──
# DeepSeek Harness is a plugin host, and ACP is one of the profiles it boots. So the
# argv is the harness's own binary plus the profile selector -- the plain-binary
# ladder again, with no adapter package and no Node entry script to resolve. The
# profile is shipped: it is created on first use, and both of its bundles are inside
# the installed package's own dependency closure, so a global install needs no
# workspace checkout and no per-profile dependency step.
# The one variable the shipped ACP profile composes its whole permission posture
# from: it selects a sandbox mode AND an approval policy together. Pinned so the
# posture never depends on an ambient value. A config layer can set the composed rows
# directly and never read this variable, which weakens confinement -- and changes
# nothing about whether Crew is consulted, because it never is.
_ENV_DEEPSEEK_PERMISSION_MODE = "DSH_PERMISSION_MODE"
# The posture Crew pins: confined to the workspace rather than unconfined. Defence
# in depth and nothing more, because it does not make this harness's tool calls reach
# Crew's gate.
DEEPSEEK_PERMISSION_MODE = "workspace-write"
# ── agent.deepseek_env: the provider key, fed from Crew's vault ──
# This harness's own credential layering resolves a provider key from the INHERITED
# PROCESS ENVIRONMENT first, above both of its credential files
# (``@deepseek-ai/dsh-credentials-local``'s own header: inherited environment,
# read-only and winning, then ``$DSH_HOME/.credentials.yaml``, then ``<cwd>/.env``,
# then ``$DSH_HOME/.env``), and a credential reference in its configuration IS an
# environment-variable name (``@deepseek-ai/dsh-credentials``'s ``credentialRef``).
# So handing the key to the harness PROCESS is authoritative for whichever provider
# names it, which is what lets ``host_auth`` declare no ``adapter_own_leaves`` for this
# harness and leave both credential files masked for its whole process tree.
#
# The reason an env-fed key is SAFER here than a spared file, rather than merely
# equivalent: the harness scrubs its own children. ``@deepseek-ai/dsh-subprocess``
# defines ``SENSITIVE_ENV_PATTERN = /KEY|PASSWORD|SECRET|TOKEN/i`` and its
# ``scrubbedParentEnv()`` drops every inherited variable matching it (plus every
# ``DSH_*`` name) before ANY child spawn -- on both spawn paths, the local bash tool's
# ``spawnSpec`` and the terminal tool's ``childEnvironment``, which both reach the same
# ``childEnv()``. So a key whose NAME is in that class is invisible to the shells the
# model drives. A name OUTSIDE that class is forwarded to those children, which is why
# Crew refuses one rather than injecting it.
#
# This regex is a MIRROR of the harness's, observed at dsh 0.1.5-rc.2, and it is the
# validator's first filter only -- not what the promise rests on. A harness release
# that narrowed or dropped its scrub would forward the key with no in-band signal, so
# the property is PROVED at every spawn instead: the read-back probe sets each
# configured name to a canary, and the gate plugin spawns one trivial child through
# the harness's own subprocess service and records, per name, whether it reached
# that child (``child_env`` in the load marker). The session is refused when any
# did (``acp_tool_gate.gate_marker_issue``).
_DEEPSEEK_ENV_CHILD_SCRUB_CLASS = re.compile("KEY|PASSWORD|SECRET|TOKEN", re.IGNORECASE)
# The harness's own reference grammar: a POSIX shell identifier
# (``@deepseek-ai/dsh-credentials``'s ``credentialRef``). Matched with ``fullmatch``
# rather than a ``$``-anchored pattern, which in Python would also accept a trailing
# newline -- and a name with one is not the variable the operator wrote.
_DEEPSEEK_ENV_NAME_GRAMMAR = re.compile("[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*")
# Namespaces on this child that a provider-key mapping may not enter: the harness's
# own, which it scrubs from its children itself, and Crew's own, which carries this
# session's IDENTITY -- ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` and the signed stub token
# (``STUB_SESSION_TOKEN_ENV``) are written by ``_apply_session_identity_env`` AFTER
# the provider key is placed, so a mapping onto either name would be overwritten
# by a live Crew credential and the harness would present THAT to its provider.
# Both names are in the harness's scrub class, so nothing else here would refuse
# them. A prefix rather than a list, because Crew's namespace grows.
_DEEPSEEK_ENV_RESERVED_PREFIXES = ("DSH_", "KIROCREW_")
# Names outside those namespaces that Crew still sets on this harness's child, listed

# have to reach all of them: the permission pin, the harness home from
# ``_extra_env`` (both ``DSH_``-prefixed, so already refused; kept as documentation
# of the sites) and kiro-cli's own model credential (actively stripped for a foreign
# backend). An operator mapping one of these would either lose their key or break
# the gate, depending on which write landed last, so the mapping is refused instead.

# High-frequency, content-free adapter stderr diagnostics that _drain_stderr()
# drops instead of forwarding as per-line WARNINGs.  The driving case is the
# claude-agent-acp "Unexpected case: {...thinking_tokens...}" line.  Mechanism
# (confirmed by reading the vendored adapter, dist/acp-agent.js): the backend
# emits a `system` message with subtype `thinking_tokens`, but the adapter's
# `switch (message.subtype)` enumerates ~18 known subtypes (init, status,
# compact_boundary, memory_recall, api_retry, ...) and routes anything else to
# `default: unreachable(message)`, which does `logger.error("Unexpected case:
# " + JSON.stringify(message))` to stderr — one line per token delta.  Measured
# at ~10 lines/sec during active thinking (one line per 2-4 thinking tokens; the
# payload is only estimated_tokens/_delta/uuid/session_id — no response content,
# so dropping them loses nothing).
#
# This is a forward-compat gap in the adapter, NOT new behavior in a specific
# backend build: the `thinking_tokens` event is present in both 2.1.165.357
# and 2.1.168.358 (verified by string-matching both bundled `claude` binaries —
# identical occurrences), so it predates the .168 update that drew attention to
# it.  Exactly when it began appearing in our logs is unconfirmed.  The cleaner
# long-term fix is upstream (add a `thinking_tokens` case to the adapter / bump
# the vendored version); this filter is the version-agnostic stopgap that also
# absorbs the next unenumerated subtype's flood.
#
# Why drop rather than just downgrade the level:
#   1. Log hygiene — gateway.log uses a RotatingFileHandler(maxBytes=2MB,
#      backupCount=3) (see cli.py), so a sustained burst rolls genuine
#      diagnostics out of the retained 8MB window.
#   2. Event-loop load — the file handler is a plain *synchronous* handler and
#      _drain_stderr runs as a task on the gateway event loop, so each forwarded
#      line costs a synchronous file write + two regex redaction passes on the
#      same loop that streams responses.  Per-session the cost is small; it
#      compounds across concurrent thinking sessions.
# (This is a log-volume / event-loop-load reduction, NOT a fix for any
# turn-stall or "agent not responding" symptom — no such causal link was
# established.)
#
# Match on a stable substring (not the full JSON) so the filter survives field
# changes, and keep the tuple NARROW so a genuine error line is never silently
# swallowed.

    Four rows in the same owner-only gate artifact directory the sealed plugin lives
    in. The first is one ``insert`` naming the plugin by absolute path, which is the
    composition channel the harness's own launcher documents (its ``boot/cmdline``
    package, and its own plugin-development guide). Emitted per process rather than
    shipped as package data because it has to name the SEALED copy, whose path
    carries this process's pid.

    The second pins the harness's tool presentation to ``native``, and it is a
    SECURITY row rather than a preference. Under ``ptc`` or ``both`` the harness
    exposes a reserved ``run_code`` transport instead of native tool schemas, and a
    program running inside it reaches Node's own APIs directly -- filesystem,
    network, subprocess -- which are not tool calls and therefore never traverse
    ``tools/pre-execute``. The gate would see one ``run_code`` call it cannot read
    and could apply no command or path rule to the JavaScript inside it. ``native``
    is the harness's own default, so this row changes nothing on a default install;
    what it does is stop an operator layer from selecting a mode that would carry
    side effects around the gate, and a ``--patch`` overlay is applied after the
    profile's own layer, so the pin wins.

    The remaining rows reassert the stock approval service with policy ``ask`` and
    the stock ACP bridge as enabled with its startup dependency. dsh applies this
    overlay after the operator layer, and ``applyEntryPatches`` replaces these fields,
    so disabling either row, changing the approval policy or changing the ACP startup
    dependency does not survive. Its ``name`` is a match guard rather than an
    assignment: a layer that replaced either module is not overwritten, and the gate
    marker's owner read-back then refuses the session.

    The path is quoted with JSON, which is a strict subset of YAML's
    double-quoted scalar, so a directory containing a quote or a backslash

#: side effect. The child is a foreign harness binary and its stderr can hold
#: whatever the operator's environment put in front of it, a credential included;
#: any scheme that ECHOES those bytes has to prove no credential survives, which
#: means proving a negative about arbitrary bytes against redactor patterns that
#: need contiguity and label anchors. One inserted byte -- a line wrap, an SGR
#: colour code -- breaks the anchor while leaving every character of the secret
#: sitting in the text. With an SGR colour code inside a ``glpat-`` token body, 530
#: of 700 splices leave the whole token readable that way: rejoining the run
#: destroys the ``-`` the pattern anchors on, and not rejoining leaves the ``[31m``
#: residue inside it. Reporting a MATCH removes the question instead of answering
#: it -- there is no path from a child byte to published text, so there is nothing
#: left to prove about the bytes.
#:
#: Covers what BOTH read-backs hit, which is why it reaches past exec failures: the
#: pi read-back's launcher refuses an exec, while the opencode read-back parses a
#: config document and can reject the flags it was handed. A shape neither of them
#: produces is not worth carrying.
#:
#: Ordered most specific first, because the shapes overlap: a shebang fault reads
#: ``bad interpreter: No such file or directory``, where the interpreter is the
#: cause and the missing file only its symptom.
#:
#: What this deliberately drops is the DETAIL inside a recognised message -- which
#: line of the config failed to parse, which path the OS refused. A capture would
#: put child bytes back in the output and reopen the whole question for the sake of
#: a number the harness repeats the moment the operator runs it themselves.
#:
#: Case-insensitive, and matched as substrings rather than whole lines, because the
#: launcher's wording differs by platform -- ``/bin/sh``, ``dyld``, ``cmd.exe`` and

    """Remap *env*'s ``HOME`` to the pod's own OAuth-grant tree, for a
    pod-spawned kiro-cli child ONLY. Mutates *env* in place and returns it.

    Gated on BOTH the pod marker (``KIROCREW_POD``, set by
    ``pod.runtime.build_pod_env`` for the whole pod gateway) and
    *pod_home_remap* (membership in ``ACP_BACKENDS_POD_HOME_REMAP`` --
    harness-parity H6/H7, never a bare backend-name comparison), so this touches
    nothing outside a pod and nothing for a harness whose credentials do not
    follow ``$HOME``. That set is deliberately NOT
    ``ACP_BACKENDS_INTERNAL_SANDBOX``: the two answer different questions --
    "does this harness carry its own OS sandbox?" versus "does relocating this
    harness's HOME move its credential store?" -- so reusing the sandbox set
    would hand a harness added there for sandbox reasons credential-relocation
    semantics it never opted into.

    The marker is compared EXACTLY to ``"1"`` rather than tested for
    truthiness. Every non-empty string is truthy in Python, so an inherited
    ``KIROCREW_POD=false`` or ``KIROCREW_POD=0`` would otherwise remap ``HOME``
    for a child that is not in a pod at all -- the inverse of what the value
    says.

    kiro-cli derives its MCP OAuth artifact directory
    (``mcp_grant.kiro_oauth_cache_dir()``) from the SPAWNED PROCESS's real
    ``$HOME`` -- there is no env var that
    relocates just that one subtree (see ``config.paths.kiro_oauth_cache_home``
    for why ``KIRO_HOME`` does not help either) -- so the only way to make
    kiro-cli's OWN writes land in the pod's tree is to remap the child's
    ``HOME`` at spawn time. ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME`` names the SAME directory
    ``config.paths.kiro_oauth_cache_home()`` resolves for the pod's ``mcp_grant``
    reads, which is what keeps kiro-cli's writer and every ``mcp_grant`` reader
    looking at one tree instead of two independent derivations of "where do
    grants live" (see ``mcp_grant.kiro_oauth_cache_dir``'s docstring for the
    split this closes).

    A remap absent ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME`` (the marker set with no pod-scoped
    directory to point at -- a malformed pod env, or a caller that set the
    marker without the directory) leaves ``env`` untouched: an unset ``HOME``
    on a spawned child would break far more than OAuth grants, so the fail
    mode here is "kiro-cli reads the real host home", the status quo, not a
    broken spawn.

    Three obligations come with moving ``HOME``, each closed here:

    * kiro-cli's own sign-in must keep working. ``pod.runtime._seed_pod_os_home``
      mirrors the AGENT RUNTIME's identity store (``~/.local/share/kiro-cli`` and
      its per-platform siblings, derived from ``identity_stores``) into this tree
      at pod boot, which is where the harness actually resolves its access token.
      The host's ``.aws/sso/cache`` is NOT copied: that staging existed in an
      earlier revision and was deleted, so a pod's ``.aws/sso/cache`` starts empty
      and holds only grants the pod itself mints.
    * ``USERPROFILE`` moves WITH ``HOME`` (Windows spelling of the same
      concept) so a Windows pod does not read one remapped path and the other
      unremapped.
    * **AWS file-based credentials deliberately do NOT follow the child into the
      pod.** ``AWS_CONFIG_FILE`` / ``AWS_SHARED_CREDENTIALS_FILE`` default to
      ``$HOME/.aws/{config,credentials}`` when unset, so a remapped ``HOME``
      sends the credential chain at the pod's own tree. An earlier revision
      pinned both variables back to the REAL home so a pod agent turn could
      still reach the operator's profiles. That pin is REMOVED, because naming
      those files in the child environment is itself the leak: ``security.py``
      matches command TEXT and performs no variable expansion, so the exported
      name is a working alias for a path the sensitive-path fence refuses by
      name -- and the alias is retrievable through an unbounded set of
      spellings (``$VAR``, ``${VAR}``, ``%VAR%``, ``$env:VAR``,
      ``os.environ['VAR']``, ``$(printenv VAR)``, ``eval``, indirect expansion,
      a helper script). Closing one spelling at a time cannot close the class:
      a text matcher cannot see through them.
      which is the only fix that does not depend on out-matching command
      substitution.

      What this costs, stated rather than implied: **an ACP agent turn inside a
      pod has no inherited AWS credentials on any path.** Both legs are closed,
      and an earlier revision of this comment got the second one wrong:

      * FILE credentials: removing the exports means ``~/.aws/{config,credentials}``
        resolves under the remapped (empty) pod home, so a profile that lives only
        in a file -- including a ``credential_process`` profile -- does not resolve.
      * ENVIRONMENT credentials: ``sandbox.scrub_agent_subprocess_env`` scrubs
        ``_SENSITIVE_ENV_PREFIXES``, which includes ``AWS_SECRET`` and
        ``AWS_SESSION``, from every Kiro/ACP child. So ``AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY``
        and ``AWS_SESSION_TOKEN`` never reach the agent turn even when the
        operator has them. ``AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`` survives (no ``AWS_ACCESS``
        prefix), but a key id without its secret is not a credential.

      ``build_pod_env`` keeps ``AWS_*``, which does NOT mean env-credentialed
      turns are unaffected: ``build_pod_env`` shapes the pod GATEWAY's
      environment, and the ACP child is scrubbed AFTER it, so the two statements
      are about different processes. The scrub is the stronger posture, and it is
      the intended one for a throwaway instance whose whole purpose is to not
      hold machine-level credentials.

      An operator who needs AWS from inside a pod therefore cannot get it by
      exporting credentials into their shell; that is a deliberate property of the
      agent-subprocess scrub, not something this function can or should undo.

      An operator who sets either pointer variable in their OWN environment has it
      REMOVED here too, which is the half a later round corrected: whose file the
      variable names does not change what the pod's agent obtains by dereferencing
      it, and an absolute host pointer walks around the ``HOME`` relocation
      entirely. ``CREDENTIAL_POINTER_ENV_VARS`` carries the whole family, so the
      scrub below covers an inherited pointer and a manufactured one alike.

    """Resolve a pod child's kiro-cli spawn: which binary, and who sandboxes it.

    Returns ``(argv, delegate_internal_sandbox)``. The second element is what
    callers pass as ``wrap_argv``'s ``is_kiro_cli``, so the binary choice and the
    sandbox-ownership choice cannot drift apart -- they are one decision with one
    cause, made here once for both ACP transports rather than restated in each.

    **Outside a pod this is a no-op by construction**: *argv* is returned
    unchanged and ``delegate_internal_sandbox`` is plain membership in
    ``ACP_BACKENDS_INTERNAL_SANDBOX``, byte-identical to what both call sites
    computed inline before. The exception is stated POSITIVELY (pod condition
    true) and gated on exactly the conditions that make
    :func:`_apply_pod_home_remap` fire -- the pod marker compared exactly to
    ``"1"``, membership in ``ACP_BACKENDS_POD_HOME_REMAP``, and a
    ``KIROCREW_OS_HOME`` to point at -- never on a backend negation, so a harness
    added to a set for some other reason cannot inherit this behaviour by
    accident (harness-parity H6/H7).

    **Why a pod child must not run the shim.** The remap gives the child a
    pod-owned ``HOME`` so kiro-cli's OAuth grants die with the pod. The installed
    ``kiro-cli`` is a shim that prefers ``aim sandbox``, and toolbox's sandbox
    builds its mount plan around the REAL user home: under a remapped ``HOME`` it
    fails to construct at all, exiting before kiro-cli starts (observed as
    ``Failed to spawn child process: Device or resource busy (os error 16)``, and
    inside a pod as ``toolbox: Unable to run aim: Command "aim" doesn't appear to
    be associated with any tool`` followed by a broken ACP pipe). Staging state
    into the pod home does not help -- an empty os-home, one carrying a
    ``.toolbox`` symlink, and one carrying a real ``.toolbox`` skeleton all fail
    identically -- because the obstacle is toolbox's mount plan, not a file the
    child cannot find. The bundle binary the shim itself falls back to has no
    such dependency: under the same remapped ``HOME`` it starts and reaches its
    normal "not logged in" state, which is precisely the state
    ``pod.runtime._seed_pod_os_home``'s staged SSO token answers.

    **So Kiro Crew's own sandbox takes over for that child.** Skipping the
    seatbelt/delegation is only sound while kiro-cli's internal sandbox actually
    runs; bypassing the shim means it does not, so ``delegate_internal_sandbox``
    goes ``False`` and ``wrap_argv`` wraps the child in Crew's launcher instead.
    The substitution is per-pod-child and never reaches a host session.

    If the bundle binary cannot be located, one further layout resolves: a symlinked
    ``argv[0]`` whose target :func:`_kiro_cli_app_bundle_target` verifies as a macOS
    ``.app`` binary. Its exec'd sibling shares that directory -- which is why the
    fixed-depth candidate above misses it -- so the real name puts the sibling beside
    the child instead of under the remapped ``HOME``.
    ``delegate_internal_sandbox`` goes ``False``, though not for the swap's reason:
    no shim is in this chain, and delegating would instead skip Crew's seatbelt for
    an internal sandbox whose behaviour under the pod's remapped ``HOME`` Crew cannot
    verify -- that remap already broke the other sandbox in this chain. Uncertainty
    resolves toward our own layer, the direction
    :func:`sandbox.kiro_internal_sandbox_enabled` states for itself. Failing both,
    the pair degrades to the status quo (shim, internal sandbox) rather than spawning
    something unlaunchable; a pod whose child cannot bootstrap is meant to be refused
    loudly at ``pod up``, not papered over here.

    """Apply the Windows resource ceiling to a just-spawned child, then resume it.

    **Call this from an executor, never inline on the event loop.** On Windows it
    reads the config file (through ``apply_windows_resource_ceiling``) and walks
    two Toolhelp snapshots — the process table for the ownership check and the
    system-wide THREAD table to resume — so a slow config store or a loaded
    machine would otherwise stall every other session on that loop. Both ACP
    spawn sites wrap it in ``run_in_executor(subprocess_executor(), ...)``. It
    stays synchronous rather than becoming a coroutine because every step is
    blocking ctypes work with no await point to offer.

    Both ACP spawn sites (:meth:`AcpClient._spawn` and ``AcpRuntime._spawn``)
    create the session host with ``creationflags |=
    platform_compat.CREATE_SUSPENDED`` and call this immediately afterwards. On
    POSIX every step is a no-op — ``CREATE_SUSPENDED`` is 0 there, so the child
    was never suspended — which keeps one code path for both platforms.

    Why suspended: ``cgroup_scope_argv`` is a no-op on Windows (no systemd), so
    without this the agent and every MCP server it spawns would run with NO
    fork-bomb and NO memory-DoS ceiling. A Job object cannot be an argv prefix,
    so it must be attached to a live pid — and job membership covers a member's
    FUTURE descendants only. Attaching to an already-running kiro-cli would
    therefore leave a window in which it could spawn an MCP server that escapes
    the ceiling. ``CREATE_SUSPENDED`` closes that window by construction: the
    child has not executed a single instruction, so it provably has no
    descendants. Assign the job, then resume.

    A resume failure is FATAL, but only when the child is actually there: a
    process that exists yet cannot be resumed is alive-but-frozen, and letting it
    masquerade as a running agent would hang the session on the ACP handshake
    with no diagnosis. Kill it and raise instead. If the pid is already gone
    there is nothing frozen to worry about — it exited on its own — so note it
    and let the handshake surface the real error.

    The ceiling itself fails SOFT (``apply_windows_resource_ceiling`` logs a
    SECURITY warning and returns False): a missing ceiling must not break the
    gateway. Only the resume may abort the spawn, which is why it runs from a
    ``finally`` — a raising ceiling must still leave the child resumed or killed,
    never frozen.

    The two DESTRUCTIVE steps are gated on confirmed ownership: the pid's parent
    must be this process. A Job object would impose a process and memory ceiling
    on a stranger, and the unresumable branch KILLS what it is holding, so
    neither may ever act on a pid we did not create. The resume itself is NOT
    gated, because ``ResumeThread`` on a thread that is not suspended is a
    documented no-op (its suspend count is already 0) — and leaving our own child
    frozen would hang the session forever on the handshake with no diagnosis.
    That asymmetry is deliberate: an unconfirmed pid loses only its ceiling,
    which already fails soft by contract, while nothing can wedge or die by
    mistake.

        Empty for EVERY mirrored backend, with no per-backend branch: a mirror's

        them down as ``stub_elements``), so one withhold rule -- the spec's

        The shared append remains for the mirror-less backends: kiro-cli reads
        the spec itself via ``--agent``, so this array is the ONLY channel its
        stubs can arrive on, and the injection outranking the spec entry is what
        pools them there.

        Membership in ``MIRRORS`` rather than ``mirror_for``, because this sits

        this work themselves.

        The names of the pooled broker stubs the caller appends are resolved here

        Session-level and additive: the on-disk agent spec is untouched, so every
        other session on the same agent keeps its ordinary tool set. The entry
        carries ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` for strict identity — the same value this
        client already exports to the child process env.

        The permission-surface precondition is asked of the BACKEND's ROUTING --
        ``acp_tool_gate.is_enforced`` -- rather than read off
        ``_claude_settings_authored`` alone. That flag answers one harness's question:
        claude declares a routing this core does not enforce, so owning
        ``settings.local.json`` is what stands in for the read-back it lacks, and
        appending session control onto a surface Crew does not own would hand a
        pre-approvable file exactly the tools the mirror's withhold keeps off it. A
        harness whose routing IS enforced cannot satisfy that flag and does not need
        to -- its session is refused before its first prompt unless the gate arms --
        and its mirror documents the flag as accepted-and-ignored (see
        ``providers/mirrors/opencode.py``), so reading the flag there would withhold
        every member's tools on the strength of a condition that cannot describe the
        backend.

        A whole-server ``disabled`` on the dashboard server stops the mount outright,
        for every backend and with no second channel to weigh: ``disabled`` has no
        per-tool or per-call form, so a harness handed the server cannot refuse a call
        to it, and the ``tools`` allowlist that keeps it out of the spec-described half
        of the array does not reach an element this method appends itself. Mounting it
        anyway would make the operator's switch-off of session control a no-op for the
        one session type that holds the strongest tools Crew hands out.

        The other composer answers alike: ``AcpRuntime`` asks
        ``session_mcp.session_mcp_server_is_disabled`` on its create and resume paths,
        so a member session on an ``ACP_BACKENDS_ACP_RUNTIME`` host (codex, KAS) gets
        the same answer this method gives. It asks through that reader rather than
        through a field on the projection because half of those hosts have no mirror to
        carry one -- KAS projects through ``acp.kas_agents``, not an array.

        A per-tool restriction on the dashboard server is the second precondition,
        and it is the one this method can UNDO rather than merely fail: the projection
        withholds a narrowed server (*restricted*), and on a backend whose
        ``registry.PerToolDeny`` is ``WHOLE_SERVER`` that withhold is the ONLY
        enforcement there is -- no rule in a file the harness reads, and no per-call
        identity Crew can refuse by. Appending the entry back would make a tool the
        operator switched off callable again. So the mount is withheld instead and the
        thread runs as plain chat. A backend with a second channel keeps its mount:
        codex refuses the call at permission time from ``denied_tools``, and claude's
        deny rules refuse it inside the adapter.

        Both halves of a session's array must agree about this. ``AcpRuntime`` mounts
        the same entry on the resume and create paths, and :meth:`_foreign_mcp_identity`
        judges a trusted tool identity against the array THIS method returns -- scoped to
        ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_MCP_ARRAY``, and reached only from
        :meth:`_refuse_identity_drift`, whose own gate is ``ACP_BACKENDS_META_IDENTITY``
        (goose alone today, so no backend mounted here runs it yet). A backend that later
        joins that set and mounts the server on one path while this one withholds it would
        refuse every dispatch call as a drifted server rather than run a plain chat.

        channel — the adapter reads no agent spec of CREW'S — so it is built by
        translating this session's agent spec (see
        :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.session_mcp`). "Of Crew's" is the load-bearing half:
        codex-acp does load a config file of its own, and being a member says only
        that this array is the sole channel from HERE to there.

        **In-memory, and deliberately so.** The translation reads disk, but it
        runs once per spawn in :meth:`_resolve_session_mcp_servers` and lands in
        ``_session_mcp_cache``; this accessor only hands the cached list out. That
        is what keeps the shared session-params call site synchronous: awaiting an
        executor hop there would put a new scheduling and failure point on EVERY
        backend's construction path — kiro-cli included, which returns ``[]``
        here and needs no I/O at all — and the kiro path is not allowed to change

        Asks the capability set rather than ``self._is_claude`` on purpose: where a
        harness gets its MCP servers is a property of its transport, not of its
        vendor, so the next such adapter joins the set instead of adding a second
        branch here (harness-parity H6). The set check comes FIRST, so a harness
        outside it returns before the cache is ever consulted and can never be
        made to read a spec.

        A cold cache resolves inline rather than returning nothing: a set member
        whose spawn path does not pre-warm would otherwise come up with zero
        tools, which is the exact defect this module exists to fix. That costs a
        brief blocking read on the loop, which is why the spawn path warms it.

        Per-spawn freshness is preserved: ``_reset_state`` clears the cache, so an
        MCP install or toggle takes effect on the next session with no gateway
        restart.

        none of Crew's own tools at all -- no ``spawn_run``, no ``cron_add``, no
        ``send_message`` -- while working in every visible respect.

        What it does NOT do is the interesting half. There is no transport filter
        here, unlike codex: an ``http`` element and an ``sse`` element are both
        ACCEPTED by ``opencode acp``, so ``drop_unadvertised_transports`` would only
        remove servers the harness would have mounted. Measured, not assumed --
        ``test/test_opencode_session_mcp.py::test_real_opencode_acp_accepts_the_crew_stdio_element``
        drives a real ``opencode acp`` the way its codex sibling drives codex-acp,
        and pins the ``initialize`` ``mcpCapabilities`` shape so a release that
        starts refusing the stdio element goes red here rather than silently
        emptying every session's tool set.

        The failure mode a bad element causes is the OPPOSITE of codex's, which is
        why the shared translator's skip discipline matters more here, not less: a
        malformed element (no ``command``, or an ``env`` that is not an array) fails
        the WHOLE ``session/new`` with ``-32602`` on this harness, where codex drops
        the element and succeeds. ``acp.session_mcp.acp_server_element`` returns
        ``None`` for an entry with neither ``command`` nor ``url`` and stringifies

        The goose twin of :meth:`_opencode_session_mcp_servers`, and it must stay

        ``~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json``, so nothing Crew declares reaches the session

        own tools at all -- no ``spawn_run``, no ``cron_add``, no ``send_message`` --
        while working in every visible respect. It also holds no pooled broker stubs,
        because :meth:`_pooled_mcp_servers` answers ``[]`` for any backend in
        ``MIRRORS`` and hands that half to the mirror instead.

        No transport filter, for opencode's reason rather than by copying it: this
        harness ACCEPTS the stdio element and mounts it, measured as a round trip
        against 1.50.1 -- the named child is asked ``initialize``,
        ``notifications/initialized``, ``tools/list`` and ``tools/call``, and the
        tool's own result comes back. So a filter would only remove servers the
        harness would have mounted.

        The failure mode a bad element causes is the LOOSEST of the three, and it is
        the one thing about this accessor a reader has to know: an element whose command
        cannot start does not fail ``session/new`` at all. The session is created with
        that element dropped, so a malformed spec line costs Crew's tools rather than the
        session.

        **The drop is unobservable on this harness, and the corpus pin is the accepted
        control.** goose emits no per-server MCP notification of any kind, so
        ``_mcp_timeout_progress`` -- which reads ``mcp_server_initialized`` -- has
        nothing to read here even as the timeout diagnostic it is; and the one
        enumeration ``session/new`` does carry, ``available_commands_update``, is
        byte-identical between a good mount and a dropped one. A session missing every
        Crew tool is therefore indistinguishable on the wire from a healthy one, and
        what stands in for a runtime check is
        ``test/fixtures/acp_frames/goose/mcp-stdio-mount-live.jsonl``: it pins the round
        trip -- ``initialize``, ``notifications/initialized``, ``tools/list`` and
        ``tools/call`` reaching the child, and its result coming back -- so a release
        that stops mounting the element goes red in the corpus rather than silently
        emptying every session's tool set.

        Accepted rather than closed, on two grounds. A dropped mount is a FUNCTIONALITY
        loss and not a gate bypass: permission routing on this harness rides on the
        seeded mode and its read-back, not on MCP, so every tool call a degraded session
        does make still reaches ``HookManager.on_tool_call``. And observing the connect
        is not goose-shaped work -- Crew hosts the broker stubs, so it can watch for the
        child's own ``initialize`` for every member of
        ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_MCP_ARRAY``. That makes it a shared-path feature rather
        than one harness's onboarding cost, and it is named as a follow-up: the broker
        observes an ``initialize`` from the child within N seconds of ``session/new``,
        and otherwise logs a warning and marks the session degraded.

        The translation lives in the mirror
        (:mod:`kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.goose`), not here, for the same reason the
        three siblings' do: projecting the agent spec onto a backend's native shape is
        one named contract with one implementation per backend.

        The count is logged HERE, on the goose arm, because it is the one thing about a
        goose session's tool set that is observable at all: the harness reports nothing
        per server and nothing on a drop, so the number Crew handed over is the only
        greppable fact a degraded session leaves behind until the broker-side mount
        check exists. A count is not a mount -- it says what was offered, not what took.

        step, so verifying the MOVED inode cannot then race: its bytes are fixed. A
        match is Crew's own seed (the caller deletes or replaces the moved file); a
        mismatch is a replacement that raced in, and it is put back untouched.

        The capture destination is a FRESH name created by ``mkstemp`` (``O_EXCL``) in
        the same directory, so it is a pathname this process just created and provably
        did NOT pre-exist. A fixed sibling name (e.g. ``<name>.crew-gc``) could name a
        file the project already owns, and ``os.replace`` onto it would clobber that
        file atomically -- relocating the very data loss this helper prevents one
        pathname over. ``os.replace`` onto our own fresh temp destroys only the empty
        temp we just made.

        ``(aside, identity)`` -- the moved file and ``(st_dev, st_ino)`` captured at

        (nothing for the caller to mutate) when the path is gone, cannot be moved, or
        holds a file that is not Crew's. A crash between the move and the caller's
        follow-up leaves at most one such ``.crew-gc`` temp beside the target, which

        the session's own argv -- the harness binary, its profile selector and the
        ``--patch`` that composes the gate -- so what is observed is the
        composition the session will run. The child is given the marker path and
        the nonce; it boots, and once Cordis settles the plugin snapshots the
        routing, proves the child-env scrub on a child of its own, and PUBLISHES the
        marker (written beside its path, renamed onto it).

        stdin is held open until that marker exists and closed only then: stdin EOF
        is this profile's own bounded shutdown (``packages/bundle/acp-app``), and
        that shutdown disposes the subprocess service, which terminates every child
        it still owns -- an EOF handed over at boot would end the proof's child under
        it and refuse every clean session. A harness that publishes nothing within
        :data:`_DSH_GATE_READBACK_TIMEOUT_S` is killed and refused.

        *child_scrub_names* are the ``agent.deepseek_env`` names: each is set in the
        probe's environment to a canary carrying the nonce -- never to the key, which
        this plugin host does not need -- and listed for the plugin, so the marker
        must report exactly that set proved absent from the harness's child.

        Both output streams are discarded: they are plugin-controlled and carry no
        read-back data. The marker is opened without following links or blocking on
        special files, accepted only as a regular file up to 64 KiB, and read once
        with a one-byte growth check before JSON parsing.

        Returns ``("", "")`` only when the marker is the one this session's own

        answerer under the pinned policy, the composed tool presentation is

        render byte-identical settings, and before this state existed the
        second one fell to the leave-it-alone branch and ran with the whole
        ``mcpServers`` array withheld -- one session per project directory got
        Crew's tools, every sibling ran toolless. The hazard the live-holder
        rule guards against (re-seeding with a DIFFERENT
        ``permissions.defaultMode``, or unlinking the file out from under the
        owner) only exists when the payloads differ, so byte-equality is the
        exact boundary of the relaxation. Both halves are required:

        * :func:`seed_provenance.share` -- Crew's durable record names
          exactly *payload*'s bytes, checked ignoring the live holder. This is
          the provenance half: the file is Crew's own seed, not a user file
          that merely looks right.
        * :meth:`_settings_path_holds` -- the file on disk still holds those
          bytes. The record alone can describe a file a user has since
          replaced, and a replacement is theirs whatever it contains.

        A differing payload -- another agent spec, another permission mode,
        another allowlist -- fails the digest half and is refused exactly as
        before.

        The state taken is deliberately NOT ownership: no live claim is made,
        ``_claude_settings_written`` stays ``None`` and
        ``_claude_settings_authored`` stays ``False``, so this client's
        teardown neither unlinks a file the owning session is still running
        against nor pops that owner's live slot. What the sharer DOES take is a
        live registration in :func:`seed_provenance.share` -- taken BEFORE the
        byte checks, so the owner's teardown can never validate-race it -- and
        that registration is what pins the file's future: while any sharer is
        registered, the owner's teardown leaves the file in place and
        :func:`seed_provenance.claim` refuses new adoptions, so no Crew session
        can put different permission bytes at a path this session already
        delivered its MCP array against. The durable registration is withdrawn
        off-loop by ``_discard_claude_settings_seed``; ``_reset_state`` then drops
        only its in-memory half. ``_permission_surface_share_validated`` alone
        feeds the sharer half of :attr:`_permission_surface_governed`; every

        The project's file stays exactly as it is: never written, and read only

        for its mode. The
        session loads only the ``user`` setting source and carries Crew's
        payload inline as ``options.settings`` (the flag tier). Neither the
        project's ``settings.local.json`` nor a checked-in
        ``.claude/settings.json`` reaches the CLI, so no ``permissions.allow`` a
        repository carries can pre-approve a call before Crew's gate sees it.
        That is what lets the session carry Crew's tools.

        One thing a file still decides: claude-agent-acp picks the STARTING
        permission mode from every settings file itself, and a file can change
        between any check here and ``session/new``. So nothing here trusts the
        file's mode. :meth:`_pin_claude_starting_mode` reads back the mode the
        session actually started in and pins :data:`_CLAUDE_PINNED_MODE` before
        the first prompt, or stops the session.

        Leaving the project tiers out must not drop what they REFUSE. So the
        ``permissions.deny`` and ``permissions.ask`` rules of both project files
        are read (bounded, never
        through a link, see :func:`_project_settings_restrictions`) and carried inline
        beside Crew's own. A file that changes after that read can only have
        gained a restriction; its allows never load either way. Project ``hooks`` and
        ``sandbox`` settings cannot be carried without reopening an approval
        channel, so a project file that sets either refuses the exclusion.

        Refused, keeping the array withheld, when this session asked for a
        permission mode of its own (the pin sets only the asking mode), when
        a project file cannot be examined or sets ``hooks`` or ``sandbox``, or
        when the adapter that
        answered the handshake is below
        :data:`CLAUDE_ACP_SETTING_SOURCES_MIN_VERSION` or reported no version.
        Before the handshake the floor is read from the installed package's own
        version, so the decision is made before the MCP array is first resolved;
        :meth:`_pin_claude_starting_mode` checks the handshake's version too.

        The highest-precedence project settings source the claude-agent-acp
        adapter reads, and the only channel for the things Crew has to control:

        1. ``permissions.defaultMode`` (``self._permission_mode``). The adapter
           short-circuits its ``canUseTool`` callback ONLY for
           ``bypassPermissions``; every other mode keeps forwarding tool
           decisions to the host as ``session/request_permission``, which is what
           puts a claude session under the same gate kiro-cli sessions run under.
           Omitted when no mode was requested, leaving the adapter's own default
           (ask) rather than asserting one.
        2. ``permissions.deny``, from
           :func:`~kiro_crew.acp.session_mcp.session_mcp_deny_rules`: the agent
           spec's ``disabledTools`` cannot ride along in the ``mcpServers`` array,
           and silently dropping a restriction while forwarding the server it
           narrows would widen the tool surface.
        3. ``availableModels`` plus the resolved ``model``, and ONLY once the
           backend has actually advertised a list. The adapter merges
           ``availableModels`` union+dedup across every settings source, so a user
           ``~/.claude`` carrying ``['opus','sonnet']`` is enough to collapse a
           versioned ``[1m]`` id (1M-token window) back to 200K -- and a
           registry-derived list seeded here does exactly the same thing to any
           model the registry has not caught up on. So on a cold advertised-model
           cache both keys are omitted (the adapter's own provider list is
           already right) and the re-seed after this session's capture fills them
           in. See :func:`~kiro_crew.model_registry.seed_available_models`.

        **Crew touches only the file it owns.** Ownership is not the path -- a
        path under a checked-out repository is not Crew's to claim -- it is having
        CREATED the file (``_claude_settings_authored``, or the durable record in
        :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.seed_provenance` for a seed an earlier session left
        behind) AND the bytes on disk still being the ones Crew wrote. Both hold:
        overwrite by STAGE AND RENAME, which is what lets the model-substitution
        re-seed change the resolved model instead of re-sending byte-identical
        params and taking the same advisory again, without a partial write ever
        being observable at the path. Either fails: leave the path entirely alone.
        Absent: create with ``O_EXCL``, so a sibling session racing the same
        ``work_dir`` loses the create rather than clobbering the winner.

        The durable half is what makes the ownership test survive the process. A
        session killed before ``_reset_state`` leaves its seed on disk, and with a
        session-scoped test only, every later session read that orphan as a
        stranger's file and refused to touch it -- so the stale allowlist, stale
        ``model`` and stale ``permissions.defaultMode`` became permanent, and no
        amount of re-running Crew could repair them. Recognizing the orphan by
        digest lets it be re-seeded (or removed on reset) while a genuinely
        user-authored file is still left exactly as it was.

        That is what keeps this seam out of a user's project state: nothing here
        reads, merges into, rewrites or deletes a file Crew did not author, so
        there is no snapshot to take, no ownership to arbitrate between two
        sessions sharing a ``work_dir``, and no restore write on the teardown
        path.

        The cost is stated rather than hidden: a project that already carries its
        own ``settings.local.json`` gets NO seed, so that session runs without the
        ``availableModels`` allowlist and without the ``permissions.deny`` rules
        derived from ``disabledTools``, and an inherited ``bypassPermissions``
        there is not stripped. Those tool calls still reach the host gate unless
        the user's own file pre-approves them, which is the same disclosed
        boundary the inherited-``~/.claude`` gap already documents. Preserving
        such a file and restoring it afterwards is tracked separately; doing it
        here means reading and rewriting a path a checked-out repository controls.

        Blocking (writes a file); callers run it off the loop.

        environment is fixed at spawn. A token withheld there can never be added

        signed mapping is (re)published when the session key becomes known, so a
        child holding a token and no key still resolves — through the mapping — to
        whichever session claimed the process.

        The KEY is conditioned, because it is a value and not a pointer: an inherited
        one names a session this client is not serving, and the resolver would read
        it as identity. The token cannot go stale the same way — its mapping is
        rewritten on every rekey, so the same token names the current owner — which
        is also why the resolver prefers it.

        Overwriting rather than popping is what keeps a reused ``env`` mapping honest:
        whatever token it arrived with, it leaves carrying THIS client's.

        The process environment is the right carrier HERE and only here: one
        ``AcpClient`` drives one child serving one session, so the process names
        exactly one session. On the shared runtime the same env would name whichever
        session claimed the process, which is why identity travels per-element there

        shared probe cache, so its own snapshot IS the cache, and the runtime
        probe's freshness rules apply to it directly:

        * A snapshot a probe confirmed within ``_ENTITLEMENT_PROBE_TTL_SECS`` is
          fresh evidence and is returned without a round-trip -- a fresh list is
          never re-probed. That is the result-clock replay with the freshness
          floor at the snapshot's own capture time.
        * There is no failure replay. A user action on the shared runtime passes
          ``force=True`` to skip the attempt-clock replay, so a failed attempt is
          never replayed here either.
        * Single-flight is owned HERE, not by the callers: every caller that
          arrives while a probe is in flight awaits that same probe, so a picker
          poll and an explicit pick overlapping never start two probe processes.
          The in-flight probe is shielded, so one caller's cancellation does not
          take the answer away from the others (the probe still tears its own
          process down).

        The snapshot is replaced only by a NON-EMPTY answer, dated by the moment
        that answer ARRIVED and marked probe-confirmed. A failed or empty probe is
        not evidence about entitlement and leaves the snapshot as it was. Returns
        the probe result (``[]`` = no evidence), or the fresh snapshot on a TTL hit.

        this model and cannot be expected to know why every turn dies. The
        session simply stays on the backend's own default, which ``session/new``
        already applied and reported as ``currentModelId``.

        Note this fixes the WIRE, not the stored setting: the persisted config /
        slot value is untouched, so a picker reading it still shows the model
        that was withheld. Healing the stored value is a separate change.

        One class of inherited pin is refused for EVERY backend rather than only
        the entitlement-checked one: a pin that a different harness's model
        catalog claims and this one does not (``model_scope``). That is a
        statement about which harness the value was picked in, which every
        backend can answer from its own namespace, unlike an entitlement question
        that only kiro can answer for its own partition. It is the case that
        motivated this withhold contract in the first place: a model chosen under
        one backend and re-sent after a switch to another. Scoped out before the
        wire, so the adapter never refuses the id and never warns about it.

        An EXPLICIT switch is handled the opposite way in :meth:`set_model`:
        there the user asked for that exact model, and quietly running another
        one would be a lie.

        The fold onto the advertised spelling happens HERE, not only at spawn: by
        this point ``session/new`` has been captured, so the advertised-model cache
        is warm even on the first-ever session -- whereas the spawn-time fold ran
        against a cold cache and was a no-op, sending a bare id that resolves to
        the base window. Same call as :meth:`set_model` uses, so an explicit switch
        and a startup application agree on one exact spelling.

        Before this step existed the seed was written once, before capture, and

        reports whether the sidecar on disk actually stopped naming the path, and
        deleting first would let a failed sidecar write leave a record that outlives
        its file, so the next process adopts, rewrites and deletes a byte-identical
        copy the user had restored. On a failed revoke the moved file is restored
        under its pathname, so a later session repairs the orphan.

        Never raises, because the caller shields it: an exception here would reach
        nobody but the "never retrieved" logger, and a half-settled transaction that
        also lost its error is worse than one that logged and left the file owned.

        The whole transaction runs under ``seed_provenance.SETTLE_LOCK``, the
        same lock a sharer's validate-then-take-lease sequence holds: without
        it, this transaction's own move-aside manufactures a vacancy at the
        pathname, and a user replacement racing into that vacancy is
        (correctly) preserved by the no-clobber restore -- leaving a sharer
        that validated the ORIGINAL bytes governed against a file it never
        verified. Under the lock a sharer validates either before the move
        (its registration then pins the post-move barrier below) or after the
        transaction settles, never inside the window.

        resume from restored state rather than replay a prompt the backend may
        have consumed; a LOCK_STALL wrote no byte, so it is not ambiguous and its
        replay is safe. The phase appears only in the log. Either phase marks

          response arrives or on timeout.

        Server requests and foreign responses must NOT be re-appended to

        can answer the deferred ``session/request_permission`` request.

        deferred frame, or the matching response) resets it to ``now + timeout``,

        The oracle walks ``/proc`` for the backend subprocess subtree — a
        synchronous filesystem walk that can block on a wedged fd — so it runs
        on ``subprocess_executor()`` under a bounded timeout, the same treatment
        the runtime's other /proc probes get. Any failure or timeout degrades to
        a non-WORKING verdict so the caller falls through to ending the turn
        (fail toward reaping, never toward hanging).

        Scope, mirroring the shared-runtime oracle this converges onto:
        - Linux-only evidence. On a host without ``/proc`` the verdict is
          UNKNOWN → the turn is reaped at the cutoff exactly as before this
          gate existed, so the change is behavior-preserving off Linux and a
          strict improvement on the gateway's Linux deploy target.
        - Subtree-aggregate movement. A busy *unrelated* descendant (e.g. an
          MCP child polling) can read WORKING even if the model turn itself is
          wedged with a lost completion frame, extending that turn to the
          ``_DEFAULT_PROMPT_TIMEOUT`` backstop rather than reaping at 90s. This
          is an inherent property of the shared ``LivenessOracle`` (the kiro
          path has it too); tighter per-branch attribution belongs in
          ``liveness.py``, shared by both callers, not here.

        A timed-out await does not stop its executor thread. The one-outstanding-
        walk bound, the refused-submission-reads-UNKNOWN contract, and exception
        retrieval all live in the shared :func:`consult_offloaded` guard.
        ``_prompt_loop`` retires the tracked future at turn start under
        ``_turn_lock``, so a walk abandoned by one turn never gates the next (at
        the cost of one abandoned worker per turn, versus one per silent read
        before this guard existed).

        its dialog for every call is the adapter's behaviour, read from its source and
        observed in the corpus, not something a client-side read can pin across
        upgrades. This is the in-band check that does not depend on it: every call the
        extension asked about left its ``toolCallId`` in the envelope, so a
        ``tool_call_update`` reaching ``completed`` for an id the gate never asked about
        is a call that ran with none of Crew's controls consulted -- whichever link
        failed (the adapter stopped honouring its own command override, stopped
        forwarding dialogs, or the extension was bypassed). The call has already run,
        so this cannot undo it; what it can do is make sure it is the LAST one: the
        harness is killed and the turn fails with a reason that names the bypass.

        Two ways to trip, one per unpinned link: a completed call the gate never
        asked about (the adapter stopped running the launcher or forwarding dialogs)
        and a completed call the host DENIED (pi stopped honouring the extension's
        block). A ``failed`` update does not trip: the harness rejects a call against
        its own schema before extension handlers run, and a call the gate DENIED is
        expected to fail -- read off the source, not assumed: pi-agent-core turns a
        handler's ``{block: true}`` into an error tool result (``agent-loop.js``,
        ``beforeResult.block`` -> ``createErrorToolResult`` with ``isError: true``)
        and pi-acp maps ``isError`` to ``status: "failed"`` on the
        ``tool_execution_end`` it forwards, so a denial reported ``completed`` is a
        harness that did not block. No-op on every session without a gate extension.

        An id's gate state lives exactly as long as its call: the terminal update,
        ``completed`` or ``failed``, consumes both the ask and any deny recorded for
        that id, because harness ids recur within a session and an approval left
        behind would vouch for a later call that merely reused the id.

        Armed for BOTH gate-extension harnesses, on the same grounds and with the
        same state. What a read-back proves is that the gate loaded in the child it
        booted; that the harness then asks for every call is its own behaviour across
        upgrades, which no client-side read pins. For the DeepSeek Harness this carries
        extra weight, because its load marker is written by the gate itself in a child
        the read-back booted: this is the check that speaks for the SESSION's own
        child, so a session whose real child composed no gate cannot complete a single
        tool call unnoticed.

        The deny channel codex does not have on the wire, supplied at the one point
        this transport does offer: codex asks ``session/request_permission`` for an
        MCP tool call, and this answers it with the adapter's own reject option
        before anything runs. Returns True when the request was answered here, so
        the caller neither yields it to a consumer nor approves it.

        Identity comes from the PRECEDING ``tool_call`` frame, never from the
        permission payload: codex-acp emits the MCP call as ``rawInput = {server,
        tool, arguments}`` (``createMcpRawInput``), the client caches that dict by
        ``toolCallId``, and the permission event carries it as ``raw_tool_params``
        with ``raw_params_trusted`` set only when it came from that cache. Both
        fields are the adapter's resolution of WHICH server and tool run -- the
        model chooses a tool, it does not get to mis-report which one -- and a deny
        can only ever deny, so no further provenance is needed. The permission
        frame's own ``rawInput`` is a different shape (``serverName`` and a prose
        description) and is not consulted.

        Server names in the deny set are spelled as codex registers them, because
        ``rawInput.server`` is the registered spelling; the mirror folds them
        (:func:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.codex.codex_projection`).

        A False here means "not refused BY THIS", nothing more: a cache miss, an

        caller decides. On the event-yielding path that is the ordinary gate and its
        human; on the auto-approve path, which has no human, ``_handle_permission``
        refuses an unidentified MCP approval itself rather than approve it blind.
        Codex's reject option for an MCP tool approval is ``cancel``, which codex-rs

        (``ReviewDecision::Abort`` in ``handle_mcp_tool_call`` ->

        leaked worker thread is survivable; a stalled dispatch is not.

        The tripwire (:meth:`_tripwire_pi_gate`) trusts a completed call only when
        the gate asked about it first, so this must run on EVERY path that answers a
        permission frame -- the streaming dispatch, which builds the event
        unconditionally, and the auto-approve site, which builds one only under a
        spec deny set. Idempotent, and a no-op without a session nonce.

        Two shapes, one tripwire. pi's adapter can only forward a generic confirm
        DIALOG, so the real call rides inside it as the envelope Crew's extension
        wrote and the id is read back out of that. The DeepSeek Harness emits an
        ordinary ACP permission frame that names the call directly, so its id is read
        off ``toolCall.toolCallId``. Deliberately the same method rather than a second
        one per harness: the state it feeds and the refusal it arms are shared, so a
        future fix to either lands in both.

        A fresh ask is a fresh verdict, so any earlier DENY for the same id is dropped
        here. Nothing makes a tool-call id unique for the life of a session: the id is
        the harness's own, and an OpenAI-compatible provider that mints per-response
        ids (``call_0``, ``call_1``) repeats them on every response -- captured live
        in ``test/fixtures/acp_frames/deepseek/tool-call-id-reuse-live.jsonl``, where
        dsh-acp emits ``call_0`` for two consecutive turns of one session, each with
        its own permission frame and its own terminal update. Without the discard a single denial would arm
        :meth:`_tripwire_pi_gate` permanently, so the next APPROVED call reusing that
        id would report ``completed`` and be killed as ``ran_despite_deny`` -- a
        healthy session ended on stale state; a new denial re-arms it through
        :meth:`_note_pi_gate_denied`. Rejected alternative: turn-scoping this state by
        clearing ``_pi_gate_asked_ids`` at the prompt boundary, because a ``completed``
        frame arriving after that boundary would then read as ``ran_without_gate`` and
        kill a healthy session for the symmetric reason. What scopes the state instead
        is the call itself: the tripwire consumes an id's ask and deny at that call's
        terminal frame, so a reused id must be asked about afresh before its next
        ``completed`` is trusted. The third link is untouched: a denied id that
        completes with NO fresh frame still trips ``ran_despite_deny``.

        codex compaction was in flight, or one was and it already reported.

        The verdict is ``failed``, and that is the opposite of what the claude
        twin synthesizes. The two harnesses differ in what a MISSING terminal
        means. claude-agent-acp sends its ``Compacting completed.`` text only for
        a MANUAL ``/compact``; an automatic mid-turn compaction takes a different
        path and emits no text at all, so for claude a turn that ends naturally
        after a ``started`` is evidence the compaction finished. codex-acp sends
        its terminal for BOTH -- the capture shows the marked
        ``tool_call_update`` on a manual ``/compact`` and on a native
        ``model_auto_compact_token_limit`` compaction alike -- so here a missing
        terminal is evidence the compaction did NOT finish. Reporting
        ``completed`` would reset the context meter against a window nobody
        summarized.

        One arm for every *reason*, unlike its claude twin, and for the same
        reason the verdict differs: this is not an inference from how the turn
        ended, it is the absence of a frame codex always sends on success. A turn
        cancelled mid-compaction did not compact either.

        Three things it deliberately does NOT do:

        * reset the context counts -- nothing was summarized, so the pre-compaction
          numbers are still the true ones;
        * arm the post-failure budget (``_compaction_failed_at``) -- that budget
          exists to bound a wait for a turn that may never end, and this runs AT
          the end of the turn, so arming it would charge the NEXT turn's idle
          clock for this one's failure;
        * claim the failure is retryable. ``last_compaction_transient`` is set
          False because an inferred failure carries no reason to classify, and
          False is the value that does not promise a user a retry will help.

        The title is text this module authors, not text a backend echoed, so it
        needs no redaction -- and it is there so the surfaces that render a
        failure reason stop collapsing this case to "unknown error".

#   is absent from this module's namespace on purpose -- a binding here would
#   shadow the owner for every later read -- and this module's code reads it as
#   ``<owner>.<name>``. A public package import only moved code reads is forwarded to
