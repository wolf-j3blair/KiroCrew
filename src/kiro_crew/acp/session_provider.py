"""AcpSessionProvider — adapts AcpSessionHandle to the LLMProvider interface.

Used by Phase 3 session sharing AND the unified kiro-path provider. When
the kiro backend is active, AcpProvider delegates to an AcpSessionProvider
(backed by AcpRuntime + AcpSessionHandle) instead of AcpClient. This gives:
- Single-reader demux: parent session + N subagents on one process
- LLMProvider interface: SubagentManager, chat_runner, etc. work unchanged
- AcpClient-compatible API: AcpProvider can call the same methods regardless
  of backend (kiro → AcpSessionProvider, CC → AcpClient)

The adapter exposes the SAME public interface as AcpClient so AcpProvider
doesn't need to branch on every method call.

        an occupied runtime, so a lease of its own would either be placed on a
        second process or found a duplicate entry for the one it already shares.
        Without a claim of some other kind it is undefended in one window: once
        the principal's teardown releases the principal's lease, nothing in the
        kill gate's registry says the process is still in use, so the reset-all
        fallback or a sweep may SIGTERM a live subagent mid-turn -- the abandoned
        prompt keeps burning credits, its frames are dropped as unknown-session,
        and the sessionId can wedge the next prompt.

        A tenancy is the claim that fits: not a lease, so it neither consumes the
        cap nor changes placement, and it outlives the entry the principal's last
        release forgets. Scoped to the TURN rather than to this object's life,
        because a turn is what a signal destroys and because a claim paired inside
        one function cannot outlive it -- an object-lifetime claim would leak on
        any path that drops a provider without shutting it down, and a leaked
        claim refuses that pid's kills for the life of the gateway.

        Returns None for an owning provider, which already holds a lease for its
        whole session: a second claim would defend a process that is defended, and
        would refuse its owner's teardown until the turn ended.

        Guarded, like the stub re-claim at the top of ``stream``: a turn must never
        fail because bookkeeping could not be done, and the worst case of not
        claiming is the behaviour that shipped before this table existed. The state
        is read directly rather than through defaults, so a wiring break surfaces
        in the log instead of being papered over by a guessed value -- and a
        provider assembled without ``__init__``, which the unit tests of this
        class's exception translation do, is inert here rather than an
        ``AttributeError`` raised into someone's turn.

        A committed teardown is the one refusal that must NOT be swallowed. It says
        the process is being ended right now and a claim would defend nothing -- the
        first signal has already left -- so proceeding would run the turn on a
        corpse and surface as a mid-stream death with no cause attached. It is
        translated into the same ``AcpProcessDied`` a dead runtime raises, which is
        the answer callers already handle by getting another runtime.

        Raised directly rather than through ``_translate_dead``: that mapping exists
        to tell a login-expiry death from an ordinary one by reading runtime state,
        and reading more state inside a guard written expressly not to crash is the
        wrong trade -- a committed teardown is a death whatever the login state says.

        on the *already-running* kiro-cli process (paying only session/new + the
        MCP-init drain), then destroy the old session so its context/transcript
        and MCP children are freed on the shared process. This SKIPS the expensive
        parts of a cold start — subprocess spawn + the ACP ``initialize`` handshake
        — which is exactly what makes pooled reuse faster than teardown+respawn.

        If the runtime is dead there is nothing warm to reuse; the caller (pool)
        detects that via ``is_alive()``/``is_process_alive()`` and replaces the

        evict, that call returns having freed nothing and each reset leaves one
        more resident session behind. Nothing downstream collects them: such a
        backend is off the eviction path by construction, and a recycle rule that

        growth, so only the age ceiling ever reaps it. Refusing BEFORE creating
