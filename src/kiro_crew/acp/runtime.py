"""ACP Runtime for multiplexed kiro-cli sessions.

Single-reader demux architecture: one AcpRuntime owns the subprocess and a
reader task that routes frames by sessionId to per-session queues. Each
``AcpSessionHandle`` (in ``session_handle.py``) owns one sessionId + queue and
provides the prompt/cancel/approve/reject API.

The per-session handle, the runtime protocol it depends on, and the runtime
exceptions live in ``session_handle.py`` (the lower layer); they are re-exported
here so ``from kiro_crew.acp.runtime import AcpSessionHandle`` (and the
exceptions) keeps working for existing callers and tests.

        RSS) over ~24h of uptime because the multiplexed design has no per-turn

        """Pre-sandbox argv for this runtime's backend, built by its harness.

        Every flag and every HOST-SPECIFIC pre-spawn gate belongs to the host, and
        the two hosts shipped today share none of them: one takes its agent and
        model on the command line and needs its spec on disk first, the other
        takes both over the wire and decides per spawn who owns the credential. A
        host added later answers all of that in its own file, which is the whole
        reason the argv is not assembled here. The derived-spec freshness gate is
        the one exception, and the comment on it below says why: it is the same
        check for every host, and it opens a bracket the runtime's own handshake
        closes.

        ONE reading of the environment drives both the search and the message
        that reports it, so a "not found (searched ...)" line can never name
        directories the resolve did not walk -- the property AcpClient._spawn
        already holds. It is snapshotted here and handed over, so the harness
        cannot take a second, different reading.

        ``host_auth`` is remembered on the instance because the reader loop uses
        it: the engine's credential callback is answered only on a process that
        was started expecting Crew to own its identity, and a dashboard sign-out
        between spawns must not change that answer for a process already running.

        The whole plan is returned, not just the argv: the credential mask has to
        reach the sandbox call, and re-deriving it there would either pay a second
        thread hop for the same filesystem work or -- worse -- silently resolve a
        different mask than the one the argv was built for.

        gate again, which re-derives the mirror from the default as it now stands, and

        the tree is ``launcher -> agent -> agent chat process -> MCP servers``,
        and every one of those below the root held no entry in either PID file.
        A root that died before its subtree -- a teardown race, a crash mid-init
        -- therefore left a multi-hundred-MB subtree reparented to init that no
        reaper could act on, because every sweep keys off those files.

        Every pass re-enumerates the tree and writes the whole answer, because
        nothing tells this process when a descendant exits: they are its
        grandchildren, so there is no ``SIGCHLD`` and no wait to reap. Looking is
        the only way to learn, and the record has to be corrected in both
        directions -- a pid that left keeps or loses its line by its own
        liveness, and a pid still there gets the identity read on THIS pass, not
        the one recorded earlier. A stale identity is what would make the
        teardown sweep read a live descendant as recycled and skip it.

        A pid the walk cannot reach but which is still alive keeps its record:
        that is the child that left the process group, and its record is the only
        handle the teardown and the sweeps have on it. One confirmed gone is
        dropped from both the record and the file.

        The identity captured is re-confirmed against a second walk before it is
        persisted. A pid released between the enumeration and the capture can be
        held by an unrelated process by the time its identity is read, and that
        identity would then be recorded as OURS -- self-consistent, so every
        later ownership check passes and the teardown signals a stranger. A pid
        absent from the second walk is not a descendant of this root and is
        dropped. The window is not closed, but crossing it now needs a pid to
        become a stranger and then become our descendant again.

        The file is written BEFORE the in-memory record is replaced, and a failed
        write publishes nothing: the next pass re-reads the tree and tries again.

        Never raises on failure. A failed scan must not fail the spawn or the
        session start that called it -- the cost is a leak the sweep still
        reports, not a broken session -- but it logs at WARNING, because that
        report is then the only signal left. A CANCELLATION is not a failure and
        is deliberately NOT swallowed: it reaches the caller's cleanup guard,
        which owns the half-built runtime or session it must tear down.

        ``kill_process_tree`` is ``killpg(getpgid(pid))``, and ``getpgid`` raises
        once the root has exited. Read as "already dead", that leaves every
        process still in the group -- the launcher's children, the agent, its
        chat process -- unsignalled, reparented to init and holding their
        memory. A root that dies a few seconds into its life, before any
        descendant was recorded, is exactly the tree nothing else can find.

        So a reaped root is not the end of the teardown. The root was spawned as
        a session leader, so its pid IS the group id, and
        :func:`_signal_orphaned_runtime_group` signals that group once a live
        member vouches for it by identity -- and by *instance*: the per-spawn
        token this runtime put in its child's environment, which is what tells
        the root's own tree from a fresh runtime that took the root's recycled
        pid and leads a group that vouches just as well. The members it returns are empty for
        a tree that really is gone, which is what the caller needs to decide
        whether the grace-and-escalate that ``wait()`` would otherwise have
        driven is still owed -- and, when it is, they are what the escalation
        hands back as *expected*, so a group SIGKILL after the grace lands only
        on the group the SIGTERM did, never on a fresh runtime that took the
        root's number in between.

        Windows has no process groups, so this ladder is the POSIX half of the
        teardown and a Windows runtime does not reach it: ``_kill_inner`` drains
        the tree through its owned handles first and returns. That drain is what
        closes the reaped-root gap described above on Windows -- the descendants
        are pinned when the tree is SPAWNED, so a root that dies before any of
        them was recorded is still reachable, where ``kill_process_tree``'s
        ``taskkill /T`` walk would find nothing to tear down. The vouched-group
        path below is therefore guarded by ``IS_POSIX``, not merely
        platform-agnostic code that happens to no-op.
        Every call is off-loop: ``taskkill`` is a blocking spawn, and the group
        walk reads ``/proc``.

        The kill is attributed once, in ``kill``, not here. ``_kill_inner`` is
        this method's only caller, so the whole ladder -- SIGTERM, the grace, the
        SIGKILL escalation, the vouched-group arm -- is the mechanics of that one
        decision, and noting it per signal would write the same shot three times.

        The frame carries the backend's FULL current subagent list (kiro-cli
        rebuilds it from `orchestrated_sessions` on every change), so replacing
        the set keeps it bounded and self-cleaning: terminated children vanish
        from the next update. Ids are backend-controlled — length-capped and
        type-checked so a hostile payload cannot grow memory unboundedly.

        Membership here is what the routing branch decides a child's approvals
        on, so the entry bound is the SHARED native-child cap
        `NATIVE_CHILD_ROSTER_CAP` — the same number `AcpSessionHandle` remembers
        child ids under — and never a tighter per-frame slice. A tighter bound
        would deny mode parity to children the very same payload made the
        handle count: an id the set does not hold is unrecognisable, its
        `session/update` is a counted drop and its permission request is
        auto-rejected, so a cap below the handle's turns one announced roster
        into two governance classes by list position alone.

        Ids past the cap are counted in `_subagent_roster_overflow`, and the
        truncation is reported through `_note_roster_overflow`: a truncated tail
        otherwise reads exactly like a roster that never named those children.
        The count is per SNAPSHOT, not cumulative — the frame is the full list,
        so replacement makes it idempotent under repeated identical rosters even
        above the cap (the handle's counter accumulates instead, because ids
        reach it one frame at a time and only a per-turn total can describe that
        stream). The LOG is episode-scoped rather than per-snapshot, which is a
        different lifetime and deliberately so: see `_note_roster_overflow`.

        The scan visits every entry even above the cap, on the SHARED demux
        loop. That is a constant factor on work already done: `json.loads` has
        walked the whole list before this method is called, and the frame is
        already bounded by `_STDOUT_BUFFER_LIMIT`. Slicing to save the pass is
        what cost the tail its governance.

        """Report a truncated roster snapshot: loud ONCE per episode, then counted.

        The first truncation an episode sees is a `WARNING`, because a truncated
        tail is otherwise invisible — nothing else in the log distinguishes it
        from a roster that never named those children, and an operator has to
        see it to decide whether the cap needs raising. What must not recur is
        the per-FRAME repeat: `subagent/list_update` is a backend-controlled
        notification re-broadcast on every child status change, so above the cap
        each rebroadcast re-earns the same warning at the backend's frame rate.
        Measured on this handler: 10 over-cap snapshots → 10 identical WARNING
        records at ~245 message bytes each, whether the frames are byte-identical
        or differ only in a child's `status`. That is the retention hazard
        `_note_dropped_frame` documents above (~60 lines/second rolling incident
        evidence out of `gateway.log`'s 8MB window), one level louder.

        So later truncations inside the episode are tallied and flushed as one
        throttled `DEBUG` summary, at most every
        `_ROSTER_OVERFLOW_SUMMARY_INTERVAL_SECS`, carrying how many snapshots
        repeated and the LARGEST tail they named. The peak, not the latest
        value: sizing the cap reads the worst case, and which value happens to
        be current at an arbitrary flush instant is noise.

        **The reset boundary is the truncation EPISODE** — it re-arms when the
        overflow count returns to 0, which is exactly the two events that
        already retire the snapshot attribution: a later roster that truncated
        nothing, and the owning session unregistering. One lifetime governs both
        halves of the same signal, so the loud line and the auto-reject reason
        can never disagree about whether the cap is under pressure. A plain
        per-interval re-arm is the alternative, and it is what the drop counter
        does, but the drop summary is `DEBUG`: re-arming a WARNING on a timer
        restates it every interval for as long as the steady state lasts, which
        is the volume this throttle exists to remove.

        The residual, stated rather than implied: a tail that GROWS inside one
        episode (40 ids, later 40000) is loud only at its first value, and the
        growth is visible in the summary's peak at `DEBUG`. Re-warning on growth
        would need a second threshold — a second throttle shape in a module that
        already has one.

        Synchronous and awaitless, like the drop counter, because the caller is
        on the shared demux loop.

        The reader loop observes a death only as EOF on stdout. A descendant
        that inherited the root's write end holds that pipe open after the root
        is gone, so EOF does not arrive and the reader -- parked on ``readuntil``
        while nothing is being written -- cannot notice the broken pipe either.
        The death is then invisible until the survivor exits (the pipe finally
        closing) or idle expiry force-reaps the session, on the order of an hour.

        This watcher keys on the exit itself, by polling ``process.returncode``.
        ``returncode`` is set by the event loop's ``_process_exited`` -- the
        SIGCHLD/waitpid path -- the instant the root is reaped, independent of
        whether the pipes have disconnected. ``process.wait()`` cannot serve
        here: its waiters are woken only from ``_call_connection_lost``, after
        ALL pipe transports disconnect, so a descendant holding stdout open
        parks ``wait()`` exactly as long as it parks the reader -- the watcher
        would never fire for the very case it exists to catch. The poll sees a
        non-``None`` returncode as soon as the root is gone, whatever the pipes
        are doing. A still-``None`` returncode is NOT an exit (a closed pipe the
        module deliberately refuses to treat as death), so the watcher keeps
        looping rather than marking dead.

        On the confirmed exit it first gives the reader a bounded window to
        drain any final frame still readable on stdout -- a completed turn's
        response the backend wrote just before exiting -- then marks the runtime
        dead, which fails every pending request and poisons every session queue,
        so a waiting turn surfaces ``AcpProcessDied`` in seconds instead of
        waiting for a backstop timer. The drain yields in short slices while the
        reader keeps routing frames (it stamps ``_last_activity`` per frame) and
        ends the moment the reader goes quiet with an empty buffer, so it costs
        the fail-fast path at most one idle slice on a pipe with nothing left.

        The reader keeps priority: the drain window lets an EOF that arrives in
        the same breath (the ordinary same-second close) run the reader's own
        death+retire path first, and ``_mark_dead`` is idempotent, so the loser
        of that race is a no-op. The exit reason is read AFTER the returncode is

        polls ``process.returncode`` so a death with stdout held open by a
        survivor is still seen. ``_kill_inner`` untracks after it
        reaps; a root killed from outside (an OOM kill, a ``pkill``, an operator)
        reached no such step, so its ``kiro_session_pids.txt`` / ``kiro_pids.txt``
        lines survived until the periodic sweep's next tick, bounded only by
        ``SessionCleanup.MAX_TICK_INTERVAL_SECS`` (300s). A registry line naming a
        dead pid is the hazard the start token exists to blunt, not one to leave
        standing for five minutes when the process that owns the line has already
        watched it die.

        A closed stdout is NOT an exit: a backend can close its pipe and keep
        running, and untracking a live process would hide it from every reaper
        for the host's uptime. So the exit is waited for, bounded by the same
        window the kill path gives a SIGKILLed child to be reaped, and the pid is
        re-probed after the wait. Any doubt -- the wait timed out, the pid still
        answers, the probe raised -- RETAINS the entries, which is the direction
        every reaper in ``session_pid`` already fails toward.

        The write itself is bound to the process, not the number: once the root
        is gone its number is free, and a replacement root this gateway spawns
        can be handed it before the write lands, so a prefix-matched untrack
        could erase the successor's only durable record. ``_untrack_root_by_identity``
        removes the session line only when its recorded start token is the one
        read at THIS spawn, and the bare root line only when the number is dead
        at the moment of a probe taken under the bare file's own lock -- a live
        holder of the number keeps its line. The root's own lines only: a
        descendant that outlived the root is reparented and still running, and
        its own ``kiro_pids.txt`` line is what the sweep reaps it by.

        Offloaded to a thread because the untrack takes the file locks the sweep
        contends for, and this runs on the event loop.

    # the agent specs BEFORE it waits on the cross-process alias lock, so without
    # ordering a start that read the spec before an edit revoked a grant could
    # return last, become ``_native_skill_projection`` and activate that alias.
    #
    # Two mechanisms close it, and each needs the other:
    #
    # * ``_skill_projection_lock`` serializes preparation AND adoption per runtime,
    #   so preparations read the specs in the order they are adopted. It is held
    #   only across the ``to_thread`` preparation and the in-memory adoption,
    #   never across ``session/set_mode`` (which can take a whole handshake budget
    #   while a switched-to MCP server boots), and never across blocking I/O on
    #   the loop: the file I/O runs in the worker thread.
    # * a generation, issued under the lock before the read, stamps each adopted
    #   projection. Adoption refuses one older than the adopted generation, and a
    #   start whose ``set_mode`` is still pending re-checks it before every attempt
    #   and after the answer: a newer view adopted meanwhile is the one it uses, or,
    #   once the host has already answered for the older alias, the start fails.
    #   The after-answer check first takes the lock itself, so a preparation that
    #   was still running when the answer arrived is adopted before it is judged.
    #   A preparation runs to completion even when its start is cancelled, and its
    #   view is adopted before the cancellation propagates; one that yields no
    #   view (or raises) is recorded as unadopted, and until a later view is
    #   adopted a pending start cannot prove its view current and fails.
    #   The lock is what makes the counter mean "read later": issued outside it, a
    #   later generation could belong to a thread that read the spec first.
    #
    # Lock order (outermost first): ``_skill_projection_lock`` (asyncio, this
    # runtime) -> the alias file lock ``_projection_alias_lock`` (flock, taken in
    # the worker thread) -> the workspace ``cli.json`` settings lock -> the
    # projection lease. Nothing that holds a file lock ever awaits the asyncio
    # lock: the file locks are taken and released inside one synchronous call on a
    # worker thread, so the thread cannot wait on the loop, and the loop never
    # blocks on a file lock. ``_stdin_write_lock`` is never taken while this lock
    # is held, because the send happens after adoption releases it, and the
    # after-answer check takes this lock with no other lock held.

        Reads the frames the reader loop already staged in
        ``_pending_init_notifications`` so a session-start timeout can name the
        servers that never reported, instead of reporting only the elapsed
        budget. Must run BEFORE ``_finish_session_init``, which drops that
        buffer once the last in-flight init closes.

        ``expected`` is the ``mcpServers`` array sent with the request. Its
        entries carry the roster names, and that is what makes the ABSENT
        servers nameable rather than only the present ones.

        The text says what that roster IS. On kiro-cli the array holds only the
        broker stubs Kiro Crew injects (``pooled_session_servers``); the agent
        spec's own servers are started by the backend and are not in it, and
        the backend's session-start steps after MCP init are not observable
        from here at all. A bare ``4/4 MCP server(s) reported`` therefore read
        as "all MCP is up, so MCP is the problem" -- a field report was
        triaged that way on the strength of the suffix alone -- when it only
        ever meant that the four injected servers had spoken. The count is
        now labelled ``session-injected``, and a complete roster is followed
        by what it does and does not cover, so a reader is not sent to chase
        MCP for a stall that is past it.

        Reports are runtime-wide rather than per-session: a request that never
        answered has no session id to match its frames against, so a concurrent
        init is called out in the text instead of being silently folded in. What
        keeps that bounded to the CONCURRENT inits is that a start whose caller
        already gave up keeps its own frames on its :class:`StartCollector`
        instead of here — un-keyed by name, they would otherwise be read as this
        attempt's progress and hide the servers that never reported.

        Guard (A2) — the spawn-flag half of Guard (A) in :meth:`create_session`.
        ``set_mode`` only ever activates an EXPLICIT override (or, on KAS, the
        injected default), so on kiro-cli the agent chosen by ``--agent`` — the
        agent of every ordinary session — reaches no availability check at all.
        It needs one, because that spec can fail to load silently: kiro-cli
        validates ``~/.kiro/agents/<agent>.json`` with ``deny_unknown_fields``
        and, on ANY unknown field, rejects the spec wholesale and runs its own
        default agent instead. :func:`kiro_crew.agent.migrate_agent_specs` exists
        to strip the two keys already known to trip it; nothing validates the
        rest, and a spec written by another tool (or by a product this install
        superseded) can carry more.

        Nothing downstream notices the substitution. The ``set_mode`` response is
        never read back, ``currentModeId`` is never re-compared, and
        :mod:`kiro_crew.acp.mcp_session_report` only LOGS — its own docstring
        forbids reading a missing report as "not mounted". The session then runs
        with NONE of Kiro Crew's control plane, while the global provider
        ``mcp.json`` that Kiro Crew pins off only on specs IT writes stays
        merged. So third-party MCP servers declared there keep working and every
        Kiro Crew tool the injected prompt names — ``learn_add`` among them —
        answers "does not exist", which the agent reports to the user as its
        memory being unavailable.

        Skipped when an override is requested: Guard (A) checks the agent
        ``set_mode`` will activate.

        ``currentModeId`` is read as PROOF, in both directions. A live probe of
        this backend settles what it means: a spec that loads is reported as the
        current mode AND listed in ``availableModes``, while a spec the backend
        refuses is absent from the list and ``currentModeId`` names the backend's
        own default instead. So a non-empty ``currentModeId`` naming something
        OTHER than the spawn agent is positive evidence of the substitution, and
        fails closed even when no advertised list came back. Treating a
        current-mode mismatch as an extra ADMIT is the hole this avoids: a
        ``currentModeId``-only response naming a substituted agent would otherwise
        sail through the compatibility escape.

        That escape is therefore narrow. It applies only when the response names
        NO current mode, where the advertised list is the sole signal and its
        absence is no evidence of a substitution -- so older kiro-cli and the
        offline fake backend behave exactly as before.

        Asked of the harness, which answers yes only for a host whose argv
        actually carries ``--agent``. Never phrased as an inequality: a negative
        test would silently capture every host added later (harness-parity H5),
        and a host that activates its agent by ``set_mode`` already has that
        response as proof -- on KAS the agent travels over the wire as an injected
        custom agent and Guard (A) covers it. Asked of the host rather than of
        "the KAS projection came back None" so the same call serves

        ONE body for both session-start paths (create and resume), because the bracket

        is edited. Any failure terminates *session_id* first: ``session/new`` or
        ``session/load`` already succeeded, so the session exists in the host and a
        plain local unregister would leak it in the shared process.

        A ``set_mode`` naming an agent activates that agent's spec, and the spec it
        activates needs the same bracket the spawn's does. Neither other gate reaches
        here: the spawn gate is keyed to ``self._agent``, so a SHARED runtime spawned
        as one agent and switched to another on this line passes no gate, and a host
        that builds no in-process tool surface never runs ``session_mcp``'s gate.

        WHERE the spec is consumed differs by host, and that decides which snapshot the
        post-check may use -- exactly ONE per consumed load:

        * ``wire_registered`` -- the spec was consumed at ``session/new``, in the wire
          payload built under the projection's own gate; ``set_mode`` activates what is
          already registered and re-reads nothing. A fresh read HERE would judge the
          file while the host holds the payload, so a revocation landing between the
          build and this line would pass that read while the registered definition
          still carried the grants it removed. The post-check compares against the
          payload's OWN snapshot. No gate call on this path: a second snapshot for one
          consumed load is the defect, not a safeguard.
        * otherwise -- the spec is consumed HERE: kiro-cli reads it from disk at
          ``set_mode`` and boots that agent's MCP servers. Gated BEFORE the send,
          because a stale mirror activated here mounts and auto-approves a server the
          default agent does not have.

        After the send returns the host has consumed the spec, which closes the window
        the snapshot opened: a write landing before that point is caught, and one
        landing after cannot change what was already consumed. Same answer as the
        ``initialize`` bracket -- a session that may have activated an unverified spec
        must not survive.

        Returns the array and whether the GRANT may follow it. The two answers are

        leave a switched-off server both named in ``tools`` and pre-approved on the
        very session that is not mounting it, which is the shape
        ``member_dispatch`` already avoids by deriving its flag from its own
        withhold.

        Asked on the resume path as well as on create, and it matters MORE there:
        ``session/load`` re-initializes the session's servers, so an unasked
        question would re-mount a switched-off server onto a conversation whose
        ``session/new`` withheld it.

        Two withholds, each the operator's own, and BOTH spellings of the switch:

        * ``agent.crew_panel`` -- the config ceiling, read through
          :func:`~kiro_crew.members.crew_panel_enabled`, which fails closed on an
          unreadable or degraded config.
        * a whole-server ``disabled`` on ``kirocrew-panel``. ``disabled`` has no
          per-tool or per-call spelling, so a harness handed the server cannot
          refuse a call to it, and the ``tools`` allowlist that keeps a disabled
          server out of a projected array does not reach an entry appended here.
        * a per-tool ``disabledTools`` naming any panel verb. Asked HERE and not
          only on the client sibling, because the two paths serve different
          backends and this one is the only path KAS takes: ``disabledTools`` is a
          hand-editable documented key in the global ``settings/mcp.json`` that
          :func:`~kiro_crew.acp.session_mcp.session_mcp_disabled_tools` reads, and
          the KAS grant that follows this mount puts ``panel_publish`` into
          ``allowedTools`` approval-free. KAS has no wire slot for hooks, so there
          is no later point at which a call to the switched-off verb could be
          refused -- withholding is the only faithful answer, and an operator's
          per-tool switch-off would otherwise be silently undone.

        The per-tool withhold takes the WHOLE server on every runtime-served
        backend rather than only where withholding is the sole deny channel. The
        mount and the grant are one answer here by construction, so keeping the
        mount for a backend that can refuse per call (codex) while withholding the
        grant would need two, and a grant that outlived a withhold is the failure
        this coupling exists to prevent. Withholding a server is an availability
        cost; forwarding an un-narrowed one is a capability the user switched off.

        Asked PER SERVER rather than inherited from the dashboard server's answer:
        the panel and session control are separate capabilities with separate
        switches, so an operator who withdrew session control keeps the drawer
        they never asked to lose, and one who switched the panel off loses only
        the panel.

        in-memory registry read at the call site
        (:func:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.registry.has_mirror`), not an await that
        returns ``None``, because H13 asks the shared construction path to stay a
        synchronous read: kiro and KAS reach their servers natively and must not gain
        an awaited step, a new call frame or a new failure mode in service of an
        adapter. ``load_session`` states the same requirement for its own resume path
        in as many words. The guard below is therefore a second line of defence rather
        than the gate, and it reads the registry rather than naming a backend, so a
        host joining ``providers.mirrors`` inherits the projection.

        A MIRRORED host cannot take the pooled array directly. The projection does two
        things the pooled resolution does not: it WITHHOLDS a broker stub for a server
        the agent's ``tools`` never references, and it returns the per-tool deny set
        the driver enforces at the approval request. Handing the raw array to the
        harness applies neither -- the harness narrows transports and nothing else --
        and a mirrored host approves its own tools internally, so an unprojected stub
        is a live tool surface Crew never granted.

        Both halves of the array go through ONE owner. The stubs are handed down as
        ``stub_elements`` rather than appended afterwards, because a stub carries the
        same ``name`` as the spec entry it rewrites: an append after the projection
        withheld that name un-withholds it, as the UNRESTRICTED server of the two.

        The stub token is minted BEFORE the projection, so it rides the stubs the
        projection keeps and no spec-translated element ever carries it -- the token
        names this session's brokered servers, and :meth:`_own_stub_session` would
        stamp every element of an array it was handed.

        ``session_key`` and ``channel_id`` reach the ELEMENT because they cannot reach
        the child any other way: a codex stdio server starts from ``env_clear()`` plus
        an allowlist and inherits nothing, so Crew's own control plane comes up with no
        session to act on unless the element carries the identity.

        ``permission_surface_owned`` is False because this runtime authors no native
        permission file. That is the fail-CLOSED direction: a mirror in claude's class
        -- one whose tools could be pre-approved in a file Crew does not own, where
        Crew's gate never fires -- withholds its array here rather than delivering it.

        Blocking work (an agent-spec parse, an overlay read) runs off the loop, the
        same as the pooled resolution it replaces.

        Every OTHER identity channel a Crew MCP child has is keyed on the process
        tree, and this runtime multiplexes N sessions over ONE kiro-cli process, so
        each of them resolves a ``spawn_run`` subagent's server to the PARENT slot
        and lets a parent re-claim overwrite it. The token is the per-SESSION name
        that tree cannot supply.

        Minted UNCONDITIONALLY. A reachable gatewayd socket is not a precondition,
        because gatewayd is not the token's only reader: the token -> session-key
        mapping is published to a MAC-signed file that the strict identity resolver
        reads with no daemon (:mod:`kiro_crew.session_token_sig`). The socket gates
        the CLAIM alone — with the gateway off, ``entries`` is empty and this still
        returns a live token for the control-plane elements to carry.

        Publication happens here, before ``session/new``, and off the event loop:
        a child launched while that request is served may resolve its identity
        before the first turn's republication, so the mapping has to exist by the
        time the element does.

        When the owning session key is already known, the claim is pushed HERE,
        before ``session/new``, and awaited: kiro-cli launches this session's
        stubs while serving that request, so a claim sent afterwards would race
        the register it exists to inform. Best-effort — ``send_claim`` swallows a
        missing/wedged gatewayd under its own timeout and returns False, and a
        session whose key is not known yet (a warm-pool worker, claimed later)

        ``rekey()`` claim then carries the token.

        ``member_session_key`` marks a crew member's DM session and carries its
        session key: the dashboard session-control server is mounted as a
        session-level entry (identity via ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY``), and the
        KAS wire agent's projection widens to grant its tools. Empty — every
        non-member session — leaves both paths byte-identical to before.

        ``channel_id`` is the channel this session belongs to, and it reaches a
        MIRRORED host's ``mcpServers`` ELEMENTS rather than the process env: a
        codex stdio server starts from ``env_clear()`` plus an allowlist, so a
        server that reports its caller's channel can only learn it from the
        element. Empty — and unread — for a host with no mirror.

        ``session/new`` runs under the loop's :class:`SessionStartGate`
        (``agent.session_start_concurrency``). ``on_gate_queued(queue)`` fires
        immediately before the wait for a permit begins and
        ``on_gate_acquired(queue_wait_ms, queue)`` at gate EXIT, so the caller can
        PAUSE its own clock for exactly the span spent queued and resume it at
        acquisition: the queue wait is not start time. ``start_priority``
        orders this start in the gate's queue (rule: ``kiro_crew.start_priority``);
        the callbacks receive ``queue`` = :data:`START_QUEUE_SESSION_NEW`. On a ``session/new`` timeout the request
        is NOT abandoned: a :class:`StartCollector` keeps it for
        ``agent.start_collect_timeout_secs`` and either hands the late session
        to ``late_adopter`` (which returns True to keep it) or tears it down;
        the raised :class:`AcpSessionStartTimeout` carries that collector. The
        gate permit is released exactly once on every path.

        A session's ``availableModels`` is captured once, from its own
        ``session/new`` response, and the backend resolves that answer from the
        account state it holds at that instant — a lookup racing a token refresh
        or a cold start can answer with the default (free-tier) set. A long-lived
        session holding such an answer refuses models the account actually has,
        and nothing ever corrects it. This re-asks the question on the SAME live
        process with a throwaway minimal session (no MCP servers, no mode
        activation), terminated before returning.

        Single-flight + short TTL, on TWO clocks. A non-empty SUCCESS is replayed
        for :data:`_ENTITLEMENT_PROBE_TTL_SECS` (its result clock); an empty or
        FAILED attempt replays as ``[]`` (no evidence) for the same window (its
        attempt clock) without re-opening a session, so a burst of failures on
        the picker read path costs one round-trip. A failure never revives an
        expired success — the two clocks are independent.

        ``force=True`` skips ONLY the attempt-clock replay: a USER ACTION (an
        explicit ``set_model`` pick, the spawn-time pin withhold) must earn a
        fresh probe rather than be refused on a recent no-evidence failure: an
        explicit action always earns a real answer. It still honours the
        result-clock replay of a recent non-empty success (fresh evidence —
        nothing is gained by re-probing) and still serializes on the
        single-flight lock. The picker read path leaves ``force=False`` so it
        keeps the burst cap.

        ``not_before`` is a freshness floor on the result-clock replay: a caller
        passes the monotonic time of the snapshot it already holds, and a replay
        never answers with a result older than that snapshot. The shared result
        cache spans every session on this process, so without the floor a broad
        answer cached before an entitlement downgrade would overwrite a newer
        session's correctly narrower ``session/new`` snapshot. A cached result
        older than the floor is not evidence for that caller: the attempt-clock
        logic below decides between ``[]`` and a fresh probe, whose result is
        always newer than the floor.

        Returns the normalized advertised list, or ``[]`` when the probe fails
        or advertises nothing. An empty return is NOT evidence about
        entitlement — callers must keep whatever snapshot they already hold.

# Compatibility facade. The module-level code for the RSS and process-table helpers
# and session-start admission lives in the owner modules imported above, and every
# name that moved stays readable as ``kiro_crew.acp.runtime.<name>``:
#
# * A moved name this module's own code reads, and that nothing patches through
#   this module, is an ordinary import above: the owner's object, bound here.
# * Every other moved name is FORWARDED. ``__getattr__`` reads it from its owner,
#   and ``_ReExportModule`` sends a write or delete there, so a patch of
#   ``kiro_crew.acp.runtime.<name>`` reaches the owner's own callers. A forwarded name
#   is absent from this module's namespace on purpose -- a binding here would
#   shadow the owner for every later read -- and this module's code reads it as
#   ``<owner>.<name>``.
# * The modules the moved code probes with (``os``, ``platform_compat``,
#   ``subprocess``, ``sys``, ``time``, ``weakref``) and the two session-handle names
#   the start collector uses stay bound here. Each helper listed in the facade
#   test's ``_SEAM_IMPORTS`` imports them from this module when it runs, so a test
#   that rebinds one on ``kiro_crew.acp.runtime`` reaches the moved caller as it did
#   before the move.
#
# ``test/test_acp_refactor_facade.py`` pins both halves: a name a test patches
# through this module is forwarded, and a forwarded name is never bound here.
