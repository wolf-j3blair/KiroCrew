"""Kiro agent spec -> the ACP ``session/new`` ``mcpServers`` array.

For a harness in :data:`~kiro_crew.acp_backends.ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_MCP_ARRAY`,
the ``session/new`` / ``session/load`` ``mcpServers`` parameter is where Kiro
Crew's MCP servers come from and the only place: neither claude-agent-acp nor
codex-acp reads ``~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json``. kiro-cli reads native servers
through ``--agent``; managed control planes can also receive per-session
overrides solely to carry ordinary identity. Without
the translation here such a session runs with ZERO Kiro Crew tools -- the harness
itself works (prompts, streaming, permissions) but ``send_message``,
``spawn_run``, ``cron_add`` and every user-installed server are simply absent.

Nothing here is Anthropic-specific by design: the module is keyed on the
capability, not on the harness, so the next adapter that reads no agent spec of
Crew's joins the set rather than growing a second translator. What is genuinely
per-adapter stays with that adapter's mirror -- codex narrows this output in
:mod:`kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.codex` (it drops any transport this session's
adapter did not advertise, and its child processes inherit no environment), and
the shape notes below are claude-agent-acp's own zod schema.

The agent spec stays the single source of truth; there is no second,
claude-shaped registry to keep in sync. It is read per spawn, so installing or
toggling an MCP server takes effect on the NEXT session with no gateway restart.
Nothing here raises: a missing or malformed spec degrades to Crew's own control
plane, never to a failed spawn.

Shape notes -- these are claude-agent-acp's zod schema rather than anything in
the ACP spec at large:

* ``env`` (stdio) and ``headers`` (http/sse) are REQUIRED arrays of
  ``{"name", "value"}`` objects. Omitting either fails ``session/new`` outright
  with ``-32602 Invalid params (expected array, received undefined)``, so they
  are always emitted -- empty when there is nothing to carry.
* A url-bearing entry is routed by ``type``. Without one the adapter takes the
  stdio branch and rejects the entry for having no ``command``, so the transport
  is always spelled out.
* kiro-cli-only keys (``timeout``, ``disabledTools``, ``autoApprove``) cannot
  ride along in an element. ``disabledTools`` is a RESTRICTION, so dropping it
  outright would widen the tool surface; it comes back as a
  ``permissions.deny`` rule instead (see :func:`session_mcp_deny_rules`).
  ``autoApprove`` is dropped deliberately, not for want of a mapping:
  Claude's nearest equivalent is a ``permissions.allow`` entry, and a
  pre-approved tool is one Claude never asks about -- so the call never reaches
  the host ``canUseTool`` gate that carries the deny floor, the sensitive-path
  check and the governance ceiling. Every MCP call on this backend is gated.

**The governing rule, stated once because each corner of it is easy to argue
separately: this module matches kiro-cli, and deviating in EITHER direction
is the defect.** Granting what kiro-cli would drop widens the session's tool
surface behind the user's back; withholding what kiro-cli would keep removes
capability from a session with no error to explain it. Two consequences that are
otherwise easy to argue backwards:

* **Which specs are resolved.** kiro-cli resolves ``--agent`` against the project
  checkout's ``.kiro/agents/*.json`` as well as ``~/.kiro/agents/``, so this
  module must too, project-nearest first. Resolving only the user level looked
  conservative and was the opposite: a project-only agent found no spec, so its
  ``tools`` allowlist never ran and the control plane mounted unrestricted --
  a user-declared restriction dropped silently. See :func:`_agent_spec_for`.
* **What the registry ceiling governs.** Registry mode withholds every
  SPEC-DECLARED server, because nothing here can resolve a marker against the
  admin's catalog. It does NOT withhold Crew's own control plane, which is
  re-derived from the managed source rather than read from the spec. That is
  kiro-cli parity, not an exemption: ``agent._install_agent_spec`` stamps the
  managed servers with ``"type": "registry"`` precisely so the client keeps them
  under registry mode, and ``agent._mcp_registry_mode`` records their
  disappearance as the defect ("the features they carry (``spawn_run``,
  ``cron_add``, ``learn_add``, ...) disappear with no local error"). Withholding
  them HERE would make this backend stricter than kiro-cli and reproduce that
  failure on the installs least able to diagnose it. The control plane is still
  subject to the ``tools`` allowlist, which is the restriction that does apply.

# server the admin's catalog governs.
#
# PUBLIC on this module because the codex projection carries this session's
# identity onto these entries; an opt-in dashboard mount is rebuilt separately
# by the Codex mirror before receiving identity. The safety of that
# carriage rests on this being the set the loop below REPLACES from the managed
# source: the element's command, args and env are Crew's own by construction, not
# the spec's. The definition sits in the leaf so a consumer the agent-SDK import
# boundary keeps off ``kiro_crew.acp`` -- the broker-stub ceiling in
# ``mcp_gateway.session_servers`` -- reads the same tuple rather than a second
# copy of it.

# Every managed Crew server that must be handed the session's IDENTITY when it
# is mounted -- a wider set than the control plane above, and a different
# question. The control plane is what a session gets whether or not its spec
# names it; this is what a session's tool calls on any Crew server need to
# succeed. Each of these servers runs through ``mcp_shared.run_mcp_stdio_loop``,
# whose ``tools/call`` reads the session's tool policy from the gateway, and the
# gateway reads a declared session key only behind an attestation. A server that
# is granted (``@kirocrew-dashboard`` in ``tools``) but carries no token comes up
# present-but-unusable: it resolves the session key through the pid sidecar and
# then refuses every call as ``identity_unattested``. On the kiro backend the
# runtime is session-unbound, so identity travels per MCP element
# (:func:`kiro_control_plane_servers`), and that carriage has to cover the
# opt-in servers too, not only the two always-on ones.
#
# Derived from the managed set rather than spelled out so a server added to it
# later is covered by construction; gatewayd mirrors this for its per-frame
# token hand-off (``CONTROL_PLANE_BACKENDS``) and a ratchet test pins the two.
# The control plane leads, in ITS order: a session that grants only the two

    ``session/load`` response -- that the default spec did not change in between. A
    caller that dropped it would have the gate and the projection but no way to close
    the window between them.

    **Project-nearest first.** kiro-cli resolves ``--agent`` against the project
    checkout as well as the user level, so a project-only agent must not read as
    "no spec": that dropped its ``tools`` allowlist and mounted the control plane
    unrestricted, which is a user-declared restriction lost rather than a default
    applied. The project spec therefore wins when both declare the name, the way
    a nearer config layer normally does.

    **An untrusted checkout never picks the servers.** With *mirrored_session*,
    a project spec that :func:`_project_mcp_trusted` refuses yields the
    user-level spec of the same name -- the one the user wrote; the checkout's
    ``tools`` filter is nothing the user granted -- with the project's switch-off
    keys (:func:`_project_restrictions`) layered on. With no user-level spec it
    yields the project spec with ``mcpServers`` cut down to those switch-off keys,

    and no project server launches. The verdict is taken inside this one read: a
    second scan of the checkout would let a spec that appears between the two
    reach the array unchecked.

    Materializes first: a source checkout that skipped setup has no spec on disk
    at all, and the claude spawn path -- unlike kiro-cli's ``--agent`` one -- has
    no other reason to write it. Best-effort and never raises.

    A DERIVED agent (``kirocrew-worker``) is answered from the freshness gate's own
    snapshot and reads nothing here -- see the comment at that branch for why a read
    after the gate is a second observation rather than a tighter one.

    Reads through ``agent_discovery._read_agent_spec``, the module's documented
    ONE reader, rather than parsing the file here: the agents directory is
    user-writable and shared with other tools, so the guards it applies are the
    point -- a symlink whose resolved target is sensitive
    (``kirocrew.json -> ~/.aws/credentials``) is refused and audited, an oversized
    file is refused at the size cap instead of being read into memory during a
    spawn, and non-UTF-8 bytes or non-object JSON come back as ``None``. The
    labels name THIS surface so a refusal is attributed to the session-MCP

    The sibling of :func:`session_mcp_deny_rules`, for a backend that has no file

    RESTRICTION, and a backend that forwards the server while dropping it widens
    the session's tool surface behind the user's back -- the dashboard writes that
    key on an ordinary tool-off action, and this repo already treats losing it as a
    defect ("dropping ``disabledTools`` on a save would silently widen the agent's
    tool surface").

    Claude re-applies the restriction as ``permissions.deny`` rules and so may keep
    the server. A backend with no deny channel has only one faithful option, which
    is to not mount the server at all -- so this returns the NAMES and lets that
    backend omit them. Withholding a server is an availability cost; forwarding an
    un-narrowed one is a capability the user switched off.

    **Crew's own control plane is exempt from WITHHOLDING, not from the
    restriction.** ``kirocrew-core`` / ``kirocrew-cron`` are re-derived from
    ``managed_mcp_spec_entry``, which emits only command/args/env, so a
    ``disabledTools`` on their spec entry never reaches the element -- and
    withholding the whole server on the strength of it would leave the session
    unable to report back to its channel at all, which is the exact defect this
    module exists to fix. The restriction itself is still honoured, on the one
    channel this transport does have: every call to one of these servers reaches
    Crew as a ``session/request_permission`` (their tools carry no annotations, so
    codex prompts for each), and the client answers a call to a switched-off tool
    with the adapter's reject option before anything runs. The pairs it checks
    come from :func:`session_mcp_disabled_tools`, on the same parse as this set.
    That channel is complete for the control plane and NOT for a third-party
    server -- a tool annotated ``readOnlyHint`` is auto-approved inside codex and
    never prompts -- which is why the two are treated differently here rather
    than both being mounted.

    ``disabled`` is deliberately NOT part of this. A disabled server is already
    absent from the array by a different mechanism: ``agent.build_agent_config``
    strips its ``@alias`` from ``tools``, and the allowlist filter in
    :func:`session_mcp_servers` mounts nothing ``tools`` does not name. Re-checking
    it here would be a second spelling of a rule that already holds.

    Derived from the ``(server, tool)`` PAIRS :func:`session_mcp_disabled_tools`
    resolved, never from the spec on its own, so the two decisions a restriction
    drives -- withhold the server, or refuse the call -- read the same sources. The
    dashboard's tool-off action writes to the global settings file and not to the
    spec, so a withhold set read from the spec alone would miss a third-party server
    narrowed the ordinary way; that server would mount, and the per-call refusal
    cannot reach it (a tool annotated ``readOnlyHint`` is approved inside codex
    without asking), so the switched-off tool would run. Its one caller is
    :func:`session_mcp_projection`, which hands in the pairs it already resolved

    per-session element cannot carry a kiro-cli-only setting -- a mute, a

    :data:`_NATIVE_ELEMENT_KEYS` -- and dropping one would widen the session's

    stays native and the element is withheld. Crew's own marks on an entry are

    being there. They split the sources by what each one is. The projection
    judges the agent spec's entry at preparation, over no settings source, since
    a restriction authored there is static for the view's life; the mount is the
    ONE reader of the settings files, at each session start, and a runtime that
    refuses a session for what a file says refuses it on the mount's verdict
    rather than on a read of its own. A projection judging the spec by a rule
    of its own would promise an element the mount then withholds, and
    ``session/new`` would fail with an error pointing at the wrong file; so both
