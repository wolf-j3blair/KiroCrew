"""The append-only crew log store: one file per unit, the gateway the only writer.

Layout, resolved against the live data home on every call (never captured at
import, so pod isolation and test isolation both keep working)::

    <data home>/crew-log/crews/<store name>/log.jsonl
    <data home>/crew-log/sessions/<store name>/log.jsonl
    <data home>/crew-log/members/<store name>/log.jsonl

``<store name>`` is the readable-plus-digest fold of the unit id that
``session_ledger`` and ``work_ledger`` already use, and the raw id lives in the
header (see :func:`crew_log_dir` for why the id is not the directory name). Both
files carry a ``.lock`` sibling in the same directory.

One dedicated ``crew-log`` root, holding every kind, is what carries the
protection: the leaf is hidden from a sandboxed process by the OS and fenced from
the agent's own file tools, and both fences are stated per leaf, so every kind
under this root inherits them and a new kind cannot be left out by omission. A
record a conductor is meant to trust as authority must not be forgeable by
anything that can call ``open()``, and a tool gate does not answer a subprocess --
which is why the session half does NOT live under the ``sessions`` transcript
root it would otherwise have shared.

Three properties are the whole design.

**Append only.** A line, once written, is never rewritten. There is exactly ONE
mutation: on ``open``, trailing bytes that are not a complete line are dropped.
Everything else -- a damaged interior line, an unknown envelope key, a type from
a newer writer -- is handled on the READ side by skipping or ignoring, never by
repairing the file. So two readers of the same bytes always agree, and a reader
is never the thing that changes history.

**Torn is decided by termination, not by taste.** Every append writes
``line + "\\n"`` and fsyncs, so a file that does not end in a newline was
interrupted mid-write. Those trailing bytes are the crash artifact and are
truncated -- unless they happen to parse whole, in which case only the newline
was lost: the record is kept and the next append re-supplies the separator. A
line that IS newline-terminated but does not parse is damage *inside* history,
so it is skipped on read and left on disk. Nothing else can be torn, which is
why this rule needs no heuristics.

**Seq comes from the file, under the lock.** ``seq`` is read back from the tail
inside the critical section on every append rather than trusted from the
in-process cache, so two writers cannot both believe they own the same number.
The read is a bounded window at the end of the file (``_TAIL_WINDOW``), not a
scan, so it costs the same on a crew log with ten lines and one with a million.
``.last_seq`` serves the cached value for callers that only want to look.

    The ONE spelling of deletion in this package, called by the retention sweep
    and by each permanent-delete funnel that reaches it -- a session's, and the
    dashboard's crew-member route -- for the reason the work crew log's
    ``purge_matching`` docstring gives: two callers deleting the same tree two
    ways is two chances to get the order wrong, and the order is the whole
    correctness argument.

    **Ownership first.** Removal goes THROUGH the lease, taken non-blocking and
    ``sole`` so it is shared with nothing: ownership is what stands between this
    and unlinking the segments a live writer is appending to. ``sole`` is not a
    detail -- the lease is refcounted per process, so a plain claim against a
    unit this process is already writing would SUCCEED by joining that count and
    prove nothing (see :func:`lease.acquire`). Either kind of contention answers
    ``owned``: this pass does nothing, and nothing is written either, so a unit
    whose writer outlives the sweep is simply collected by a later one.

    **Then the caller re-decides, INSIDE the hold.** *guard* is REQUIRED and is
    called as ``guard(directory)`` once ownership is held; the unit is removed
    only if it answers true. The lease alone is not enough, and the gap is the
    same one ``purge_matching`` documents: a selection made outside it is a
    SNAPSHOT, and ownership deliberately ends BETWEEN turns, so a session can be
    revived, append, finish its turn and release the lease in the window between
    the decision and the delete -- after which the removal would take a live
    conversation's log while contending with nobody. Re-reading under the hold is
    what makes the decision current, which is why the guard is a callback rather
    than a filter the caller applies first, and why there is no default that
    skips the re-decision. A caller whose precondition is not a property of the
    file passes ``lambda _dir: True`` and says at the call site what does decide.

    **A caller with a companion file OUTSIDE the unit passes ``in_hold``, and it
    runs while this lease is still held, BEFORE anything here is destroyed.** Some of
    a unit's meaning lives outside its directory -- a member's pre-log activity source
    is the case -- and a caller that removed such a file after this function RETURNED
    would do it in the window between the release here and its own next line, where
    another PROCESS can create the unit afresh and fold that source back in. The lease
    is taken ``sole`` and so cannot be shared, which is why the caller cannot simply
    hold it itself; a hook inside the hold closes that window without a second
    spelling of deletion. Optional, so a caller with nothing outside the unit passes
    nothing and is unaffected.

    It runs FIRST, and a false answer stops the removal with ``failed`` and nothing
    here touched. The gate that stops such a companion being read again can live
    inside THIS unit -- a fold marker does -- so a unit destroyed while its companion
    survives is not a partial success but an armed one: the survivor becomes readable
    again with its gate gone, and nothing revisits the unit to notice. In this order a
    refusal leaves both in place and both still gated, and the unit stays
    identifiable for a later pass to aim at again.

    **Then order, with IDENTITY LAST.** Segments carry the header, so they are the
    history and they go first; the per-append lock file next; then any other
    entry, none of them followed if it is a link. The ``.lease`` file is removed
    LAST and only by its holder, which is what keeps ``lease``'s inode check a
    fact about this code: while it exists, the lease path names the file whose
    lock proves ownership, and a lease unlinked before the segments would let a
    second remover take a lock on a fresh inode and unlink the same files
    concurrently. Windows refuses an in-hold unlink and gets it after release
    instead, which is safe there precisely because it fails while any handle is
    open -- the same asymmetry :func:`session_ledger.unlink_lock_in_hold`
    documents, so that function is reused rather than copied.

    **Nothing is written to a crew log that is about to go.** No "pruned" entry, no
    tombstone: removal is not rotation and not a format change, and a reader
    holding a citation into the unit already has its answer from
    ``Ref.resolve``, which reports ``gone`` for a pointer into a unit that has no
    crew log at all.

    Failures are COUNTED, not ignored, and reported for what they are. A unit
    that could not be fully removed answers ``failed`` rather than being reported
    as collected, and stays addressable so the next pass can aim at it again --
    but ``failed`` does not promise its history survived. Segments go first, so
    the ordinary partial removal is history already gone with something else left
    standing; the log line says which of the two happened rather than claiming
    the segments were kept.

      resolves it, and it is accepted only if it folds BACK to this directory's
      own name. A directory no id addresses is not removed, because the removal
      would be aimed by id and would resolve somewhere else.
    * **A trash hold** (:data:`TRASH_HOLD_FILE`). The unit is live while the rest of
      its session waits in the trash, so the user can still restore it whole.
    * **A torn tail.** Unterminated trailing bytes are what
      ``open(repair=True)`` truncates, and the sweep cannot tell a dead writer's
      crash artifact from an append that has not yet reached its fsync -- the
      bytes are identical. Deleting the unit would destroy the history the repair
      exists to recover, so the repair gets it and retention does not.
    * **The newest lifecycle entry is not a ``session/closed``.** An OPEN session
      is never touched, whatever its age, and this is the check that decides it.
      The pair ``session/opened`` / ``session/closed`` is what moves a unit
      between the two states, so the newest of the PAIR is the answer -- not the
      newest close on its own. A resumed session appends to the crew log it already
      had, so ``... closed ... opened ...`` is a legitimate file whose session is
      running right now. The read is bounded, so the deciding entry could in
      principle sit further back than the window -- but only entries written after
      it can push it out, and once a unit is closed the emitter writes nothing but
      a handful of in-flight closers unless the session was revived, which appends
      its own ``session/opened``. So a lifecycle entry outside the window means a
      live session, which is exactly the unit that must be kept: the bound fails
      closed rather than needing a full scan of every crew log on every pass.
    * **A segment that vanished mid-read.** Another remover -- the delete funnel,
      or a second pass -- got there first, which is the outcome this sweep wanted.
      It reads as "nothing to do" rather than as a failure, because the caller's
      failure tally is what an operator reads as "these units still hold
      history", and counting a race that already collected one would make that
      number a lie.

    The age comes from the LAST ``session/closed`` entry's own ``time``, falling
    back to the newest segment's mtime only when that field is unusable. The
    entry wins because it is the writer's own record of when the session ended
    and nothing rewrites it, while mtime is metadata a copy, a restore or a
    backup tool resets -- a restored tree would read as freshly closed and never
    expire. The fallback is kept rather than skipping the unit because a damaged
    ``time`` still proves the session ended, and mtime is then the best available
    bound on when writing stopped; it can only be at or after the real close, so
    it errs toward keeping the file.

    Four numbers, each closing a different way the answer could go stale:

    * the directory's own mtime, which moves when a segment is ADDED or REMOVED -- a
      rotation, or retention taking the oldest;
    * the number of segments, because two changes inside one mtime granularity can leave
      the directory looking untouched while its contents are not;
    * the newest segment's size and mtime, which move on an APPEND -- the one change that
      does not touch the directory at all, and the one that can add a decision.

    Deliberately NOT a content hash: this runs per unit on a boot path, and the whole
    point is to be cheaper than reading the bytes. It is a staleness check, not proof of
    identity -- so it is used only to skip re-deriving a NEGATIVE verdict, where being
    wrong costs a decision that is re-read on the next change, and never to admit an edge
    that no read produced.

    What a cold rebuild needs, and the reason it cannot use the tail window alone: a
    decision is silently lost when the log grew past that window after it was written,
    and the consequence of losing one is not a missing edge but a WRONG one -- the
    sidebar restores the creating edge and shows a session under a parent that gave it
    up, with nothing to correct it. A bounded read is the right cost for a live unit and
    the wrong answer for a rebuild that has no checkpoint to fall back on.

    Segments are searched NEWEST FIRST, and the first one that answers wins: a decision
    in a newer segment supersedes anything an older one holds, so the walk stops at the
    first hit rather than reading the rest. A unit that has never rotated therefore
    costs exactly what the tail read costs, which is the ordinary case; a rotated unit
    costs one read per segment until its newest decision is found, and a unit that
    records none costs one read per segment once.

    Inside a segment the search is still the windowed one for the LAST window, then the
    whole file when the window did not reach its start -- so a decision anywhere in a
    rotated log is found, and the common case pays the cheap read first.

        ``child_gone`` narrows what ``repair`` is allowed to conclude, and is the
        only thing that lets it close an unmatched ``subagent/spawned``. A child
        outlives its asking turn by design, so an unmatched opener does NOT mean
        the child is finished -- a writer torn down inside a live process can leave
        one still running and still able to file its own real terminal, which would
        put two outcomes for one ``agent_id`` in a file nothing rewrites. No fact
        derivable from the file answers this, and no flag does either: what settles
        it is the live subagent registry of the process doing the repair, so the
        caller that holds one passes a predicate over ``agent_id``. Omitted, no
        child is closed -- the direction that leaves a reader behind rather than
        wrong.

        A zero-byte file answers ``no_ledger``, the same answer ``create`` gives
        it. One meaning for an empty file across both paths is what keeps them
        from disagreeing: a create that could not finish leaves nothing behind,
        and a retry succeeds instead of being refused by the fragment.

        ``repair`` is what closes an INTERRUPTED TURN, and it is opt-in because
        the callers of ``open`` want opposite things. A RESUME -- the gateway
        finding a session log whose writer is gone -- wants the open turn
        closed, and passes ``repair=True``. A live writer RECONNECTING to its own
        crew log must not: its turn is still running, and closing it would append a
        ``turn/completed {interrupted}`` in the middle of a turn that then keeps
        writing, so the record would claim an outcome the turn never had. A
        reconnect happens for reasons that have nothing to do with the writer's
        health -- a handle evicted from a bounded cache is enough -- so repair
        cannot be inferred from the fact that an ``open`` is happening at all. The
        third caller is a SUPERSEDE, which wants the same thing a resume wants but
        for a store that is not its own, and reaches it through
        :meth:`repair_interrupted_turn` rather than this flag so it can report how
        many closers landed. See :func:`_close_interrupted_tail`; the torn-tail
        truncation below is unconditional because trailing bytes that are not a
        complete line are not a record, so nothing can be reading them.

        line becomes several ``message/chunk`` entries plus the entry that CITES
        their seqs, and appending those one at a time leaves a window where a hard
        kill puts the chunks on disk with nothing pointing at them -- the body is
        stored and unreachable, and the citing entry that would have explained it
        never exists. Written together, a crash leaves either the whole group or a
        torn tail, and the tail is what the next append truncates.

        *cite* is how a citation is made unable to disagree with the allocation. The
        caller passes ONLY the cited entries in *items* and a callable; this method
        calls it INSIDE the lock, with the seqs it has just allocated for those

        read another handle -- a resumed session, a second process -- can append and
        shift the whole run, after which the citation names seqs belonging to the
        intruder. Nothing detects that later: the seqs exist and parse.

        joins -- so a rejected group leaves the file identical. One lock, one
        ``write()``, one ``fsync``.

        ``thread`` is deliberately not accepted here. A group is self-contained by

        *known* is the reader DECLARING the types it can interpret, and passing
        it is what turns this read into a reconstruction rather than a listing.
        Then an entry whose type is not in *known* either is skipped, when the
        writer marked it ``ignorable``, or raises ``unknown_entry_type`` when it
        did not: a required entry the reader cannot interpret may change the
        meaning of every entry after it, so a fold that continued past one would
        produce a confident wrong answer instead of an admitted failure.

        The default, ``None``, means "I understand everything" and is exactly the
        behaviour every caller had before the marker existed -- no refusal, every
        entry yielded. The gate is opt-in because only a caller that FOLDS state
        is harmed by a line it skipped; :meth:`page` deliberately has no such
        parameter, since paging renders history for a human and showing an
        unfamiliar line is not a wrong answer.

        Reads across SEGMENTS, oldest first, and requires seq to stay contiguous
        over each boundary -- a gap between segments is damage or a partial copy,
        and yielding across it would hand a fold a hole it cannot see. A gap at the
        FRONT is not damage: that is retention, so a first segment starting above 1
        is read as it stands.

        Every WALKED entry -- including the ones below *seq* that are never
        yielded -- must carry a seq strictly greater than the entry before it.
        A duplicate or backward seq is refused with ``bad_data``, the same
        verdict :func:`~kiro_crew.crew_log.projection.advance` gives it, so an
        incremental read and a fold from the start agree on a damaged file
        instead of one refusing and the other silently skipping the record.
        The append-only writer cannot produce a non-advancing seq, so one in
        the file is external damage, not history. A forward GAP stays
        tolerated: inside one file it is a damaged line ``_iter_entries``
        skipped on purpose, and this check deliberately does not harden into
        a contiguity requirement.

        *strict_seq* is that refusal, and ``False`` is for the RENDERING
        callers only: a page shows history to a human, so refusing every
        intact line of a unit because one damaged line exists elsewhere in it
        would take the history away exactly when damage makes it most worth
        reading. A caller that FOLDS state must keep the default -- tolerating
        a non-advancing seq there is how two reads of the same bytes disagree,

        entry from that independent file becomes authoritative. The filename's first
        seq is a second provenance claim and must agree with the physical first entry
        when that record is readable.

        Seq continuity remains a boundary-only check. Inside one file a missing seq
        means a damaged line, which ``_iter_entries`` skips on purpose -- one
        unreadable record must not make the rest of the file unreadable. Across two
        files a gap is a different thing: a half-finished copy or deleted middle

    A body too large for one line is written as chunks plus the entry that cites
    their seqs, in one batch. A hard kill during that write can still tear the tail,
    and the citing entry is the LAST line -- so what survives is chunks nothing
    points at. The body is on disk and unreachable: no entry names those seqs, and
    the message the group belongs to has no record at all.

    Dropping them is the honest repair. It costs the one message that was mid-write,
    which is the same residual as any single entry lost to a hard kill, and it leaves
    the file free of lines whose only purpose was to be cited by an entry that does

    yield stops matching the file at the first oversized record and every offset

    valid history, which is the one thing this file's rules forbid. So a record that

    Three kinds of opener can be left unbalanced, and they are NOT scoped alike.

    A ``turn/started`` with no later ``turn/completed`` means the writer stopped
    mid-turn. Unmatched ``tool/called`` and ``approval/requested`` entries are
    collected only from INSIDE that turn: both are turn-scoped by construction --
    a call completes within its turn, and an approval is decided in the same
    ``finally`` that the turn's own path runs through -- so an unmatched one in a
    turn that DID complete is a different anomaly, and inventing an outcome for it
    here would be this reader editing history it was not asked about.

    An unmatched ``subagent/spawned`` is collected across the WHOLE file instead,
    because a child is deliberately not turn-scoped: it starts, steers and reports
    long after its asking turn ended, so the ordinary dangling case is a child
    whose turn completed normally. Scoping it to the open turn would close only the
    rare child that died inside its own turn and leave every common one open
    forever.

    Children are kept only when *child_gone* says so, and that asymmetry is the
    point. "The writer is gone" is what a repair knows, and for a turn-scoped
    opener that settles it -- the turn died with its writer. It does NOT settle a
    child: a child outlives the turn that asked for it BY DESIGN, so a writer
    torn down inside a live process can leave a child still running, still able to
    file its own real terminal. Closing it from here would put two outcomes for one
    ``agent_id`` in a file nothing rewrites. Nothing in the file distinguishes the
    two, so the question goes to the caller's live subagent registry; with no
    predicate the answer is "still running" and the opener stands.

    This fold feeds a mutation, so it reports every record the ordinary reader
    would skip. A repair cannot distinguish a truly open turn from one whose real
    completion is damaged, and appending a closer after such a skip would make a
    false outcome permanent.

    special case: is this still running, or did its writer die? Closing the tail
    when the crew log is LOADED after an interruption answers that once, in the
    record, instead of in each reader.

    Two openers are closed on any repair, each with the "not knowable from the
    record" word its own type already uses: an unmatched ``tool/called`` and an
    unmatched ``approval/requested``, both turn-scoped, both settled by the one
    thing a repair knows -- that the writer is gone.

    A third, ``subagent/spawned``, is closed only for an ``agent_id`` the caller's
    *child_gone* predicate reports finished. A child is not turn-scoped, so a
    writer torn down inside a LIVE process can leave a child still running and
    still able to file its own real terminal; closing it from here would put two
    outcomes for one ``agent_id`` in a file nothing rewrites. Only the repairing
    process's own registry of running children can rule that out. This can
    therefore fire on a file whose newest turn completed normally and whose only
    open thing is a child that outlived it.

    "Loaded after an interruption" is the whole precondition, which is why this is
    never reached from a plain ``open``. An open turn is indistinguishable from a
    dead one by looking at the file, so the CALLER's situation is the only thing
    that can tell them apart: a resume knows the previous writer is gone, and a
    live writer reconnecting to its own log knows it is not. Closing a turn
    that is still running would append an outcome it never had and then let the
    turn keep writing past its own completion.

    It stays append-only -- nothing is rewritten, seq continues -- so a reader that
    already folded the file sees only new lines.
