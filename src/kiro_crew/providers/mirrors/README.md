# Agent-config mirrors

One agent spec (`~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json`) is the single source of truth for
every backend Kiro Crew drives. No two backends read it the same way. A **mirror**
projects that spec onto one backend's native configuration.

Design and rationale: `docs/request-for-change/rfc-agent-config-mirror.md`.

## Why this folder exists

The same defect shipped twice. A session came up holding
`tools: ["@kirocrew-core", ...]` with nothing defining `kirocrew-core` — refs
naming nothing, every Crew tool silently absent, the harness otherwise working and
no error anywhere. KAS hit it first and fixed it in `acp/kas_agents.py`;
claude-agent-acp hit the identical thing later and it was diagnosed again, from
scratch, by someone who did not know the first had happened. Then a fourth backend
(codex) arrived and got a copy-paste twin of claude's override hook.

Nothing in any of those files said "this is a projection of the agent spec, and
every backend needs one." That sentence is what this folder is.

## Runtime guard

A mirror is the fix for one backend. `agent_sdk/mcp_refs.py` is the detector, so a
fourth occurrence cannot be silent. At each point where the
`session/new` / `session/load` `mcpServers` array is final — spec projection plus
the gateway's broker stubs — `acp/mcp_ref_guard.py` compares the spec's `@server`
refs against Crew's projection for the session (the array it is about to send), and
logs ONE structured warning naming the backend, the agent, the unresolved refs and
whether the shared gateway is on. The line claims only what the wire proves: Crew's
projection delivers none of those servers, and the harness may mount a same-named
server from its own configuration, so a listed ref may still be served and the line
cannot tell which. It also records them on the session's MCP report
(`unresolved_refs`), beside the buckets saying what a configured server reported —
a different claim, because a server nothing configured has no row there to be
missing from.

The runtime guard is installed at both final-array composition points:
`AcpClient._guard_unresolved_mcp_refs` and
`AcpRuntime._guard_unresolved_mcp_refs`. Both use the same resolver and record
`unresolved_refs` on the session report, so KAS and the shared-runtime paths are
covered as well as direct client sessions.

The resolver sits in the SDK rather than in the ACP layer because the question is
not an ACP question: spec in, wire array in, backend id in, refs out. That is what
lets `kirocrew doctor` evaluate the same function per selectable backend, before a
session exists, without taking an ACP edge (`agent_spec_mcp_refs` in
`agent_sdk/drivers/acp.py` supplies it the spec and each backend's projection).

It never changes the array and never fails the session: a ref naming nothing is a
configuration fact, and the complaint about this defect class was that it was
invisible, not that it was tolerated. Two rules keep it from crying wolf — kiro-cli
reads the spec itself via `--agent`, so its refs resolve against the spec's own
`mcpServers` rather than the (deliberately empty) wire array; and `@builtin` and
bare tool names are not server refs. Backends without a complete spec projection
still receive the same non-fatal diagnostic when an `@server` reference is
unresolved.

## What a mirror must do

Implement `AgentConfigMirror` (`base.py`) in a file named after the backend, and
register it in `registry.py`.

- **`rulings()` is mandatory.** For every `Concern`, state one of four
  dispositions with a reason. It is abstract so a new backend cannot inherit
  silence.
- **`session_params()`** — the wire face, for params merged into `session/new` /
  `session/load`. Must be a pure in-memory read at the call site: that site is
  shared with kiro-cli, and adapter work must not add a scheduling or failure
  point to kiro-cli's construction path (harness-parity H13). Warm a cache on the
  spawn path.
- **`session_projection()`** — the structured face the CLIENT actually calls:
  the wire params plus any obligation the same spec parse hands the client
  (`SessionProjection.denied_tools`, the `(server, tool)` pairs the client must
  refuse when the backend asks permission for them). The default returns the
  wire params with nothing off-wire, so a mirror that has no such obligation
  implements only `session_params()`. A mirror that does (codex) overrides this
  and defines `session_params()` as its `.params`, so the two faces cannot drift.
  Also the seam the gateway's pooled stubs come through (`stub_elements`): the
  client's shared append is inert for every mirrored backend, so a mirror that
  does not place them ships a backend the gateway cannot pool onto.
- **`write_files()`** — the file face, for native config the harness loads itself.
  **Create-or-decline**: create the file, or leave the path entirely alone. Never
  read, merge into, rewrite or delete a file Crew did not author.

Implement either face, both, or neither. Claude Code uses both.

## The four dispositions

| Disposition | Means | Is it a gap? |
|---|---|---|
| `delivered` | reaches the backend in the spec's own shape | no |
| `translated` | reaches it under another name or vocabulary | no |
| `no-channel` | the backend HAS the capability, this transport cannot carry it | **yes** — a backlog item, and `channel` must name where it would go |
| `withheld` | deliberately not sent, with a reason | no — a decision |

`no-channel` and `withheld` are the two that matter. Conflating them is the
documented cause of the `hooks` regression: see `UNSUPPORTED_SPEC_KEYS` in
`acp/kas_agents.py`, whose comment states the rule this vocabulary generalises —
*no slot on the wire is not no such capability in the backend*.

## The five projection kinds

A disposition answers "what happens to this concern"; a **kind** answers the prior
question, "how does anything reach this backend at all?". Every backend id this
build can spell has one `McpProjection` in `registry.py`, and the kind is what a
test can read.

| Kind | Means | Required fields |
|---|---|---|
| `native` | the backend reads `~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json` itself, so there is nothing to project | `reason` |
| `mirror` | a mirror in this folder projects it; must have a class in `MIRRORS` | `reason` |
| `external` | Crew projects it, from a module outside this folder | `reason`, `projection`, `tracking` |
| `no-channel` | no transport this backend advertises can carry Crew's servers | `reason`, `channel`, `tracking` |
| `broker-only` | the shared broker reaches the backend, but the agent spec's own servers and per-tool deny set do not | `reason`, `tracking` |

`no-channel` is the only kind under which a session legitimately holds none of
Crew's tools, and it is the one the prose form could not distinguish from a
backlog item. A paragraph can explain a gap without ever giving it an address, and
a gap with no address is indistinguishable from a decision — so the three kinds that
are not finished states are required to be ADDRESSABLE, by the constructor rather
than by a reviewer. `channel` names what would have to exist; `projection` names
the module a reader goes to; `tracking` is an issue URL or a repo-relative
`path#anchor` the parity test resolves.

A `native` or `mirror` declaration may carry neither, and its `reason` may not read
as a schedule: the parity test rejects "pending", "not yet moved", "unwritten" and
their relatives on those two kinds.

Every kind is additionally cross-checked against something outside its own text,
so no kind's honesty rests on how its reason is worded. `mirror` needs a
registered class and an `mcpServers` ruling of `delivered` or `translated`;
`external` needs an importable module; `no-channel` needs a channel, a resolvable
tracking pointer and an onboarding row; `broker-only` needs a resolvable tracking
pointer; and `native` and `external` are checked
against `agent_sdk/mcp_refs.py`, which has to know the same fact to resolve a
`@server` ref at all — it satisfies a ref from the spec's OWN `mcpServers` for a
backend whose spec servers reach the session off the wire
(`ACP_BACKENDS_SPEC_SERVERS_OFF_WIRE`: the harness reads the file itself, or Crew
projects it down a channel that is not the array) and from the wire array for
every other. A declaration and the resolver acting on it may not diverge, in
either direction. A selectable backend
whose projection was not written could previously sit under one name with an
explanation of when it would be, and every check stayed green — which is the
structural reason the same missing-tools defect shipped on four harnesses in a row.

## Adding a backend: checklist

1. **Decide the kind.** Read its `initialize` result before deciding: what the
   harness advertises is the answer, not what it resembles. A harness that
   advertises no transport the `session/new` array can use is `no-channel`, and
   that is a legitimate destination — named, not implied.
2. **Write the mirror, or write the declaration.** `mirror` means a
   `<backend>.py` here with a mirror class and its `rulings()`, registered in
   `MIRRORS`. Every other kind means an entry in `PROJECTIONS` with the fields its
   kind requires. A backend in neither table raises.
3. **Route it.** For a `mirror`, point the backend's session-params hook on
   `AcpClient` at the mirror so the declaration and the wire agree.
4. **The parity test then holds you to it** (`test/test_provider_mirrors.py`):
   one declaration per known and selectable id, `mirror` only with a class,
   `mcpServers` ruled `delivered` or `translated` on a mirror, `native` and
   `external` only for an id `agent_sdk/mcp_refs.py` resolves against the spec
   itself and every other kind only for one it resolves against the array, a resolvable
   `tracking`, an importable `projection`, and every concern answered with a
   reason.
5. **The doctor row.** A selected `no-channel` backend prints one informational
   row naming its `channel` and `tracking`, so the operator who chose it learns
   that Crew's tools are absent by declaration rather than by diagnosis.
6. **The onboarding table row.** A selectable `no-channel` backend must also be
   named in `docs/system-specs/modules/harness-onboarding.md`, and the parity test
   checks it. The declaration is what code reads; the onboarding table is what a
   human reads BEFORE writing any of this, so a gap recorded in only one of the
   two is a gap the next author misses.
7. **Measure the adapter, in the lane.** Anything you learn by driving the real
   adapter belongs in a guarded contract test, and those run in CI's `Real Adapter
   Contract Tests` lane: it runs `npm ci` on the locked manifest in
   `test/real_adapters/` and sets `KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE=1`, so an absent adapter
   fails the lane instead of skipping it. Mark the new test `@pytest.mark.real_adapter`,
   call the gate in its body, and add the adapter's exact version to that manifest
   (then `npm install --package-lock-only` there and commit both files); a
   measurement no lane runs is a measurement that stops being true without telling
   anyone. Dependabot bumps the manifest weekly, and that bump PR's run of the lane
   is where a new release's drift shows up -- re-measure there, never relax.
8. **Fill the card.** Nothing to write — the section below is what the declaration
   you just wrote already renders. Read it back as the operator will, because that
   is the step that catches a kind or a reach you did not mean.

The folder makes a mirror easy to find and easy to copy. The test is what asks
the question. Both are needed — a folder alone is just a tidier place to forget.

## Fill the card: what this declaration shows the operator

Every field of the declaration above is read back to the person CHOOSING the
backend. That is the last step of onboarding a harness here, and it costs nothing
to write: the card is a projection
(`src/kiro_crew/agent_sdk/backend_mcp_ability.py`), so a harness with a
`PROJECTIONS` entry has a complete card and a harness without one has a card that
says nothing rather than a card that is quietly wrong.

It renders in two places, from one projection, and they carry DIFFERENT amounts of
it — the card is narrower than the record on purpose:

- **Settings > Agent Harness**, in the detail for the highlighted harness, and only
  where switching costs the reader something: the deny reach as a rule with its
  exception, and the spec settings that will not take effect. Not the projection KIND
  — `native`/`mirror`/`external` names the route Crew takes, which no reader can act
  on. Labels are keyed by `PerToolDeny` reach and by `Concern`, never by backend,
  which is why a new harness needs no frontend edit and no locale edit.
- **`kirocrew doctor`**, in two lines rather than a table: the ability card of the
  harness IN USE — naming the withheld concerns by the key the agent spec itself
  spells (`permissions.defaultMode`, not the card's machine id), because the reader
  there is holding the file — and one sentence naming every harness where a tool-off
  can withhold Crew's own control plane, which is the fact a chooser needs before
  switching. The row
  prints declared values; the sentence says what the `whole-server` reach COSTS,
  because that consequence reaches Crew's own control plane and no reading of the
  value supplies it. The full per-harness comparison is the panel's: it has the room,
  and a row apiece on every terminal run is a section readers learn to skip.

Six things reach the card, and one deliberately does not:

The admission rule is one line: a fact reaches the CARD only where switching to this
harness costs the reader a feature, adds a risk, or makes one of their own agent-file
settings ineffective. Everything else the declaration knows is true, useful to a
maintainer, and stays in `kirocrew doctor` and this file.

| On the card | From | Reads as |
|---|---|---|
| **Not** the projection kind | `McpProjection.kind` | the route Crew takes — no feature lost, no risk taken, no setting of theirs stopped. `kirocrew doctor` states it |
| The per-tool deny reach | `McpProjection.per_tool_deny` | what switching ONE tool off costs here — that tool, or the whole server |
| Whether that reach costs a whole server | `COSTS_WHOLE_SERVER` in `backend_mcp_ability.py`, shipped beside the reach as `costs_whole_server` | which reaches earn the prominent slot, decided once for every surface rather than re-derived per renderer — true of `whole-server` and of `per-call`, which withholds any non-Crew server whole |
| Whether it costs CREW's servers | `McpAbility.costs_control_plane` in `backend_mcp_ability.py`, read by the terminal report and not shipped | the narrower question: only `whole-server` takes `kirocrew-core` with it, which is what leaves a session unable to report back. `per-call` refuses per tool on Crew's own servers, so it costs a third-party server and not the channel |
| Concerns ruled `withheld` | the mirror's `rulings()` | a settled decision that a part of the spec is not sent |
| Concerns ruled `no-channel` | the mirror's `rulings()` | a gap the transport cannot carry yet, with an address recorded for it |
| **Not** the `reason` prose | — | written for the reader of this folder, at this folder's length. A user-facing reason would be a NEW field every mirror fills in, not this one re-registered |

Two facts an operator might expect are absent on purpose. **Transports** are not a
per-backend constant and must not be rendered as one: they are read from the live
session's `initialize` answer (`codex.drop_unadvertised_transports`), precisely so a
released adapter that gains or drops one is not silently contradicted by a table.
And the card is **advisory** — it does not refuse a selection. Per-tool MCP deny is
not a requirement on every provider, so declaring which form a harness carries before
a session runs is the whole obligation; enforcing a per-call deny on a transport that
has no per-call identity is not.

`test/test_backend_mcp_ability.py` holds this: every selectable backend answers,
every `Concern` is either on the card or recorded off it with a reason, and every
kind and reach reaches a reader. A concern added to the vocabulary fails that test
until somebody decides which of the two it is.

## Where the translation logic lives

Beside the mirror, not inside it, when it is substantial:

- `acp/session_mcp.py` — the spec-entry to array-element translation, the `tools` allowlist and the registry filter. Shared: both session-array backends read it, and what is genuinely per-adapter stays in that adapter's mirror (codex's `codex_elements` narrows this output).
- `acp/kas_permissions.py` — KAS's `allowedTools` to `permissions` mapping.
- `agent_sdk/mcp_refs.py` — the provider-agnostic unresolved-ref resolver above,
  and the one reader of the `tools` ref vocabulary that `session_mcp` mounts
  through. `acp/mcp_ref_guard.py` is its one-line-of-log half, at the session
  call sites.

A mirror declares and routes; a helper translates.

## Current state

Declared in `PROJECTIONS` (`registry.py`); this table is a reading of it, not a
second source.

Two columns, because a reader wants two different things: `Kind` says whether the
spec reaches the backend at all, and `Per-tool deny` says how much of a *restriction*
survives the trip. The second is a `PerToolDeny` member on the same record
(`registry.py`), declared per mirror and cross-checked against behaviour by
`test/test_provider_mirrors.py::TestPerToolDenyIsDeclaredAndTrue` — so it is a
checkable claim rather than prose that can rot. **Per-tool MCP deny is not a
requirement on every provider**; the point of declaring it is that a reader learns
which of the three states they are getting before a session runs, rather than after
a tool they switched off answers anyway.

- `settings-file` — the restriction becomes a per-tool rule in a file Crew writes,
  so the narrowed server stays **mounted** and the harness refuses the tool.
- `per-call` — no per-tool slot on the wire, but the backend asks permission per MCP
  call with an identity Crew can match, so Crew refuses the call. The narrowed server
  may stay mounted where that channel is complete.
- `whole-server` — no channel at all. The only faithful action is **withholding the
  whole server**, so the restriction costs availability rather than being dropped.

| Backend | Kind | Per-tool deny | Where it goes, and what is outstanding |
|---|---|---|---|
| `` (kiro-cli) | `native` | — | reads the spec itself via `--agent`. Its only native-config write is the small `cli.json` overlay, whose home is a separate decision |
| `claude` | `mirror` | `settings-file` | `claude_code.py`, both faces; `hooks` is its one open `no-channel` disposition |
| `codex` | `mirror` | `per-call` | `codex.py`, wire face only — Crew writes no codex file, so the `session/new` array is its whole channel. `hooks` is its one open `no-channel` disposition; `disabledTools` is honoured by withholding a third-party server it narrows, and by refusing the call at the approval request for Crew's own control plane; the array, the withhold set and the deny pairs all come from one spec parse |
| `kas` | `external` | — | `acp/kas_agents.py` (+ `acp/kas_permissions.py`), travelling as `_meta.kiro.customAgents`. The most complete projection of any backend, down a real channel — what is outstanding is only WHERE the code sits, and the RFC schedules that as a pure relocation of its own so a live harness's projection is not moved and changed in one diff |
| `opencode` | `mirror` | `settings-file` | `opencode.py`, wire face plus the permission routing — the `session/new` array is its whole MCP channel, because Crew's one config write there (`OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`) MERGES with the user's config and declaring a server in both channels double-mounts it. `hooks` is its one open `no-channel` disposition. This entry read `no-channel` until the claim was MEASURED: its `initialize` advertises `http` and `sse` and no stdio, which was taken as a refusal — but ACP's `McpCapabilities` has only those two fields, so no conforming agent can advertise stdio and the array carries them fine. The stdio `type` tag the shared translator emits is DROPPED here rather than left to the adapter to discard. `disabledTools` becomes a `deny` rule in that same routing block, `{"*": "ask", "<server>_<tool>": "deny"}`, keyed on the id the harness gives an MCP tool (`opencode_tool_id`): it hides that one tool while the server, Crew's control plane included, stays mounted and its other tools still ask. The harness lets the LAST matching rule win, and a lower config source that already names the tool keeps its earlier place behind the seed's `*`, so the routing read-back evaluates the resolved rules the way the harness does (`_opencode_unenforced_denies`) and a server whose rule did not hold is withheld whole, with a warning. An id the harness re-maps to a builtin rule (`apply_patch` and five more) is withheld the same way |
| `pi` | `no-channel` | — | `pi-acp` accepts the session array but does not forward it to the pi process, so the session receives none of Crew's tools; the required channel and tracking pointer are declared in `registry.py` |
| `goose` | `mirror` | `per-call` | `goose.py`, wire face only — a live adapter round trip proves stdio tools are reachable. `disabledTools` is refused per call: goose asks `session/request_permission` for every MCP call under `GOOSE_MODE=approve`, a `readOnlyHint` tool included, and names the pair as `_meta.goose.toolCall.{extensionName,toolName}`, so the projection hands the client every switched-off pair and a narrowed server stays mounted — unlike codex, a third-party one too. Two measured gaps withhold a server whole instead: a server name outside `[a-z0-9_-]`, which goose reports under a folded spelling no refusal could match; and a tool goose's own `permission.yaml` lists under `always_allow`, which runs without asking at all (`goose_always_allowed`; an unreadable file counts as allowing everything). That file bypasses Crew's permission gate for ANY tool it lists, not only a switched-off one; the projection only checks the switched-off ones |
| `deepseek` | `broker-only` | — | the shared broker's stdio stubs are reachable, but the agent spec's own servers and per-tool deny set are not projected; `registry.py` tracks the missing projection |

## Verify against the adapter, not against the last mirror

Codex is the reason this section exists. Its hook sat at `[]` behind a docstring
that stated, as the one established constraint, that codex-acp answers `-32602`
for the whole `session/new` when it meets a transport it does not advertise. A
real adapter answers by the element's SHAPE, and both answers are measured. A
malformed stdio element — and even an array member that is not an object — leaves
`session/new` succeeding with that element dropped. An `sse` element the adapter's
own `mcpCapabilities` marks unsupported is refused with `-32600` when it is
schema-complete (carrying its `headers` array, the shape Crew's translation
emits), and the refusal fails the WHOLE `session/new`; the same element without
`headers` falls to the untagged variant and leaves `session/new` succeeding with
that server accepted and never wired, exactly as a deliberately meaningless
`{"type": "nonsense-type"}` control does. So the fear was wrong in its code and
its scope, and half-wrong in its direction — and the fail-OPEN half is the
expensive one: a healthy session with a silently missing tool, which nothing
downstream reports. Client-side transport narrowing is therefore both a defence
against a fatal refusal AND the only guard that the array Crew sends is the array
the adapter honours, and that argument had been load-bearing for a whole
harness's tool surface in one direction only.

So a new mirror's transport and environment rules are MEASURED. `codex.py` cites
what was run and `test/test_codex_session_mcp.py` pins it against an installed
adapter, skipping cleanly when there is none. Copying the neighbouring mirror's
shape is the cheap half; only the adapter can tell you whether it is accepted.

opencode is the same lesson in the OTHER direction, and it is the more expensive
half. Codex's docstring over-feared a refusal and shipped an empty array behind an
explanation; opencode's declaration inferred a refusal **from an advertisement that
cannot express the thing** — `mcpCapabilities` has exactly two boolean fields,
`http` and `sse`, so the missing `stdio` flag was never a flag a conforming agent
could have set. That reading made a whole harness's tool surface empty, kept every
check green, and even contradicted the shipped code beside it: the shared gateway's
broker stubs are stdio elements too, and `_pooled_mcp_servers` had been appending
them to that same array for opencode all along. So the rule is narrower than
"measure a refusal": **an absence in a capability advertisement is not evidence
until you have read the schema that would carry it.**
