"""opencode's agent-config mirror (``opencode acp``).

The wire face only, and it exists because the reason opencode had no projection
was WRONG. The previous declaration read the harness's ``initialize`` result --
``mcpCapabilities: {"http": true, "sse": true}`` -- as evidence that the
``session/new`` ``mcpServers`` array could not carry a stdio server. It carries
them fine. ACP's own ``McpCapabilities`` schema has exactly two boolean fields,
``http`` and ``sse``, and no ``stdio`` field at all, so a conforming agent CANNOT
advertise stdio and ``{"http": true, "sse": true}`` is what full support looks
like. The absence proved nothing, and reading it as a refusal left every opencode
session with none of Crew's own tools -- no ``spawn_run``, no ``cron_add``, no
``send_message`` -- on a harness that is selectable, working in every visible
respect.

Measured against opencode 1.18.30 rather than re-inferred
(``docs/request-for-change/rfc-agent-config-mirror.md``, and the ratchet in
``test/test_opencode_session_mcp.py``):

* The element ``acp/session_mcp.py::acp_server_element`` already emits --
  ``{"name", "command", "args", "env": [{"name","value"}], "type": "stdio"}`` --
  is ACCEPTED, the child is spawned, its tools are listed and the element's ``env``
  reaches it. Dropping the ``type`` key gives a byte-identical result.
* ``type: "stdio"`` is TOLERATED AND DISCARDED, not honoured -- and this
  projection DROPS IT anyway rather than relying on that. The adapter's ACP union
  is ``http`` and ``sse`` as tagged members plus an untagged stdio member, and zod
  strips unknown keys, so the tag fails the two tagged members and matches the
  untagged one, which has no ``type`` field. But the mapping function then
  discriminates on the mere PRESENCE of ``type``, so a tag that SURVIVED would take
  the element down the remote branch and throw on its ``headers``. Sending the tag
  therefore makes every session start depend on one third-party implementation
  detail -- a schema switched to passthrough or strict -- and on this harness the
  penalty is not one missing server but ``-32602`` for the whole ``session/new``.
  Removing it costs nothing (measured byte-identical with and without) and removes
  the dependence, so :func:`opencode_elements` removes it.
* ``env`` and ``args`` are REQUIRED arrays, and a malformed element fails the
  WHOLE ``session/new`` with ``-32602`` -- not just that server. That is why
  ``acp_server_element``'s skip-and-log discipline is load-bearing here rather than
  merely tidy, and it is the opposite of codex, where a malformed stdio element is
  dropped and the request succeeds.
* ``http`` and ``sse`` elements are BOTH accepted, so this backend needs no
  analogue of codex's :func:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.codex.drop_unadvertised_transports`.
  One caveat worth stating rather than discovering: the adapter maps ``sse`` onto
  its own ``remote`` kind, which is streamable HTTP, and it has no SSE-specific
  path -- so an SSE-only server mounted here is spoken to over the wrong shape.
  That is the harness's mapping, not something a projection can correct.
* The MCP child INHERITS the ambient environment (133 variables in the probe); it
  is not ``env_clear()``ed the way codex's is. The element ``env`` is still the
  right carrier for ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY``, but for a different reason -- it is
  what makes the value THIS session's rather than the gateway's.

Crew writes no opencode config file of its own beyond the permission routing
(``AcpClient._opencode_routing_config`` seeds ``OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`` with the
one setting ``tool_gate`` demands, plus one ``deny`` rule per switched-off MCP tool
-- see :func:`opencode_projection`), and the MCP servers deliberately do NOT travel
there. That channel works, but ``OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`` MERGES with the project
and user config rather than replacing them, and declaring the same server in both
the config block and the array DOUBLE-MOUNTS it: both children spawn, because the
array does not go through config resolution at all. So the array is the one
channel, and this module is the whole of it.

    **The identity env goes on Crew's OWN CONTROL PLANE and nowhere else.**
    ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` is the credential Crew's internal API authenticates a
    session-directive claim with, so it may ride only an element Crew itself
    derived. ``kirocrew-core`` and ``kirocrew-cron`` are exactly that: the shared
    translation REPLACES them from ``managed_mcp_spec_entry``, so their command,
    args and env are Crew's own by construction and no part of the hand-editable
    spec reaches the child. Everything else in the array gets NO Crew identity,
    because an element the spec describes is one whose command, args and env the
    spec chose -- handing it this session's credential would let a hand-edited line
    drive the session it was mounted into.

    The carriage is needed for a DIFFERENT reason than codex's, and the difference
    is worth keeping straight because it decides what happens if the rule is
    dropped. codex-rs ``env_clear()``s its stdio children, so without the element
    ``env`` codex's control plane has no session key at all. opencode's children
    inherit the ambient environment, so a gateway-level ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY``
    would reach them -- and it would be the WRONG one, the gateway's rather than
    this session's. Dropping the rule here therefore mis-scopes rather than
    empties, which is the harder failure to notice.

    **The stdio ``type`` tag is REMOVED, and that is not tidiness.** The adapter
    tolerates it only because zod strips unknown keys before its union matches the
    untagged stdio member -- and its ACP-to-native mapping then branches on whether
    ``type`` is PRESENT, so a tag that survived would be routed as a remote server
    and throw on its absent ``headers``. Keeping it would make every opencode
    session start depend on that stripping behaviour, and the penalty here is the
    whole ``session/new`` failing with ``-32602`` rather than one server going
    missing. Measured byte-identical with and without
    (``test_real_opencode_acp_accepts_the_crew_stdio_element`` drives both shapes),
    so the safe form is free. Only the stdio tag goes: ``http`` and ``sse`` elements
    need theirs, because for them the tag is what the adapter's union matches on.

    **No name folding, and that is a measured absence rather than an omission.**
    codex registers a client element under
    ``name.replace(whitespace, "_")``, so its mirror has to reproduce the fold or
    its own session report names a server that does not exist. opencode registers
    the name as given (``mcp.add({directory, name, config})``); the sanitising it
    does do is on the TOOL id it shows the model
    (``sanitize(server) + "_" + sanitize(tool)``), which is a display spelling this
    projection does not compare against. With no fold there is no collision this
    projection could manufacture, and the translated half is already keyed by name.

        ``permission_surface_owned`` is accepted and IGNORED (it arrives in
        ``kwargs``), which is the documented behaviour for a mirror outside
        claude's class. The flag exists because claude's permission surface is a
        file Crew may not own, so a pre-approved tool there never sends
        ``session/request_permission`` and Crew's gate never fires. opencode has no
        such file in play: its routing is seeded on ``OPENCODE_CONFIG_CONTENT`` and
        then READ BACK from the harness's own config resolution, so a session whose
        resolved value is not the required one is refused before its first prompt.
        Failing closed on the flag here would withhold every Crew tool from every
        opencode session on the strength of a condition that does not describe this
        backend.

        ``session_key`` and ``channel_id`` are the caller's, because a mirror
        cannot discover them. On this harness they scope rather than supply: the
        MCP child inherits the ambient environment, so without them a
        control-plane child would come up holding the GATEWAY's session key
        instead of this session's.

        ``work_dir`` is the session's project checkout and is required for
        CORRECTNESS, not convenience: kiro-cli resolves ``--agent`` against
        ``<work_dir>/.kiro/agents`` as well as the user level, so omitting it makes
        a project-only agent read as "no spec" and drops the ``tools`` allowlist
        that spec declared.

        ``stub_elements`` are the shared gateway's broker stubs for this session,
        which the caller holds (it owns the overlay) and this mirror places, so the
        withhold rule covers both halves of the array -- see
        :func:`opencode_projection`.

        Blocking -- it reads the agent spec. The caller warms this on the opencode
        spawn path and serves the shared ``session/new`` call site from that cache
        (harness-parity H13).
