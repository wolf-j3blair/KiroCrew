"""The agent-config mirror contract: one declared projection per backend.

One agent spec (``~/.kiro/agents/<name>.json``) is the single source of truth for
every backend Kiro Crew drives, and no two backends read it the same way. kiro-cli
is handed ``--agent`` and reads the file itself; KAS takes client agents over the
wire as ``_meta.kiro.customAgents``; claude-agent-acp takes MCP servers as a
``session/new`` parameter and other settings from a file it loads on its own.

Projecting the spec onto those shapes is a thing every backend author has to do,
and until this module nothing said so. The cost was paid twice: KAS shipped with
its ``mcpServers`` block omitted, leaving a session holding
``tools: ["@kirocrew-core", ...]`` with nothing defining ``kirocrew-core`` — refs
naming nothing and every Crew tool silently absent — and claude-agent-acp arrived
later with the identical defect, diagnosed a second time by a second
investigation that did not know the first had happened.

What this module adds is not translation logic (that stays with each backend, in
its own file beside this one) but a **declaration that a reviewer can read and a
test can assert**: for every concern the spec carries, each backend states which
of four things happens to it. ``no-channel`` and ``withheld`` are the two the
previous code could not tell apart, and conflating them is the documented cause
of the ``hooks`` regression — see ``UNSUPPORTED_SPEC_KEYS`` in
:mod:`kiro_crew.acp.kas_agents`, whose comment states the rule this vocabulary
generalises: *no slot on the wire is not no such capability in the backend*.
