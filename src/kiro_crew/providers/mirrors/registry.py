"""Which backend projects the agent spec how — as a typed declaration, per backend.

The point of a registry rather than a lookup that returns ``None`` on a miss is
that **absence has to be a statement**. A backend with no entry here fails the
parity test; a backend that genuinely needs no projection says so, in a record a
test can read.

A free-text reason was not enough to carry that distinction. "Declared not to
need one" and "nobody got round to it" were both spelled as a paragraph of prose
under one name, so a selectable backend could sit there with an explanation of
why its projection had not been written and every check stayed green. That is the
structural reason the same missing-tools defect shipped on four harnesses in a
row. :class:`McpProjection` replaces the paragraph with a KIND, and the kinds
that are not finished states carry the fields that make them addressable — what
would have to exist, and where the work is tracked.

The declaration lives here rather than in :mod:`kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backends`,
which owns the capability sets, for one mechanical reason: that module is a leaf
that imports neither ``kiro_crew.acp`` nor ``kiro_crew.providers``, and
``config.loader`` reaches it from inside ``KiroCrewConfig.load()``. A table
naming this folder's mirror classes would put that cycle back. The projection
vocabulary (:class:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.base.Concern`,
:class:`~kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.base.Disposition`) already lives in this
folder, so the declaration that selects between them belongs beside it.

    This is a DECLARATION, not a requirement. Per-tool MCP deny is not something
    every provider can offer, and this folder's thesis is that an honest "this

    Three members rather than the one flag its shipped reader branches on
    (``doctor_checks.mcp`` acts on ``WHOLE_SERVER`` alone), and the reason is the
    drift test rather than a future renderer: the three states are told apart by two
    INDEPENDENT observations -- whether a narrowed server stays mounted, and whether
    the projection hands the client a deny set -- so the test catches claude
    silently ceasing to write its deny rules and codex silently ceasing to hand over
    its pairs. A boolean cannot express either: both would read false and stay
