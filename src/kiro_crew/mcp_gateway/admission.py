"""Daemon-global admission around backend spawn + initialize.

Before this module the gateway daemon had no bound on how many backend
processes it would fork and hand an ``initialize`` at the same time. A pooled key
was deduplicated per key and capped as a RESIDENT count by ``max_backends``; a
private backend was bounded by nothing. A wide session fan-out therefore turned
into hundreds of concurrent ``create_subprocess_exec`` calls on one event loop,
every one of them reading the same interpreter tree off a saturated disk, and
the daemon's own liveness ping missed while it was doing so.

:class:`SpawnGate` is the one bound: a daemon-wide count of spawns in flight,
where "in flight" runs from just before the fork until the backend's first
``initialize`` has resolved (or provably will never arrive). Callers past the
count wait in FIFO order. It does not replace ``max_backends`` (resident
ceiling, still enforced by the pool) or the circuit breaker (per-key crash
loop); it sits INSIDE both -- acquired after the per-key spawn lock and after
``CircuitBreaker.allow`` -- so a permit is never held during a breaker cooldown
and no pool lock is held while queued.

Two things about a :class:`Permit` are deliberately separate:

* ``settle(outcome)`` records what the spawn told us about the host --
  ``success`` (initialize completed), ``failure`` (fork or initialize failed
  for a reason that looks like congestion) or ``neutral`` (nothing learned: the
  caller was cancelled, a prewarmed backend nobody initialised, a client that
  never sent ``initialize``). It is exactly-once: the first outcome sticks.
* ``release()`` frees the slot. Idempotent, and it settles ``neutral`` first
  if nothing was recorded, so a permit can never leak a slot or a verdict.

Capacity is FIXED in this module: ``set_capacity`` is the seam the adaptive
controller plugs into later, clamped to ``[floor, ceiling]``. Raising capacity
wakes queued waiters; lowering it lets in-flight spawns finish and simply admits
fewer afterwards. Outcomes are counted so the controller has its signal.

``close()`` is the drain hook: every queued waiter is failed with
:class:`SpawnGateClosed`, every initialize watcher is cancelled (releasing its
permit as neutral), and later ``acquire`` calls fail immediately. Cancellation
at any boundary is neutral: a caller cancelled after its grant but before it
resumed gives the slot straight back.

    many subagents could get started. Raising the ceiling to the subagent
    ceiling lets the adaptive controller grow the gate to one backend
