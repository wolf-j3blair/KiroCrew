"""``AdaptiveController``: samples the host, runs the policy, drives the actuators.

One asyncio task on the gateway event loop. Every ``controller_sample_secs``
(5 s) it

1. measures event-loop lag (how late its own timer fired), reads host memory,
   RSS and open fds off the loop (``asyncio.to_thread``), and asks the MCP
   gateway daemon for its ``stats`` frame (spawn gate + host budget) -- also
   off the loop, over a fresh control connection with the manager's own
   timeout;
2. folds the evidence the hooks below recorded since the last tick (session
   start latencies, attributable timeouts, provider throttles, completions)
   into one :class:`~.signals.Sample`;
3. hands it to :class:`~.policy.AdaptivePolicy` and applies the
   :class:`~.policy.Decision`: the execution cap through
   ``SubagentManager.set_effective_cap`` (natural shrink -- in-flight work
   finishes, nothing is killed) and the spawn-gate capacity through
   ``GatewayManager.set_spawn_capacity`` (the daemon clamps to its own
   floor/ceiling and lets in-flight spawns finish). The execution cap moves on
   work evidence only; loop lag and free memory shape the spawn gate alone.

The controller never blocks the loop and never raises out of its task: a
failed sample is logged and the previous caps stand. Its state is a plain dict
(:meth:`AdaptiveController.state`) that ``resource_status`` renders, and every
decision that changes something is a bounded counter
(:data:`~kiro_crew.metrics.events.ADAPTIVE_DECISIONS`).

Hooks for the evidence the sampler cannot see on its own live on the
controller: ``record_start`` (session/backend start latency and whether it
timed out for a congestion reason), ``record_provider_throttle`` (a typed 429
from the ACP stream, scoped to its provider), ``note_gate_outcome`` (the
``SpawnGate(on_settle=...)`` seam when the gate is in-process). Completions are
observed by diffing the subagent manager's run table each tick, so no hook in
the run loop is required.
