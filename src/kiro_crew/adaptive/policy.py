"""``AdaptivePolicy``: the deterministic AIMD state machine (RFC §5.2).

Pure. It reads :class:`~.signals.Sample` objects (each carrying its own
timestamp) and returns :class:`Decision` objects; it owns no clock, no task, no
socket. The controller in :mod:`.controller` is the only thing that acts on a
decision, and the tests drive the policy with hand-built samples.

Two tracks, two kinds of evidence, one decision per sample. The gateway's
execution cap (subagent and runner-lane starts) and the daemon's spawn gate
(backend forks) have different bounds -- ``user_max`` / ``floor`` /
``user_max`` and ``spawn_concurrency_initial`` / ``_min`` / the gate ceiling --
and they read different evidence (:mod:`.signals`):

* the **execution cap** reads WORK evidence only: attributable timeouts, slow
  starts, failing MCP servers, spawn-gate init failures, fd and process
  exhaustion, a low completion rate. It never reads the gateway's loop lag or
  free memory. Memory is the per-start spawn floor's (``agent.spawn_min_memory_gb``),
  which prices every start against what it will settle at; a count cap moved
  by memory or lag on top of that floor is what throttled one chat's subagents
  behind another's. Nothing is sufficient alone for it: a cut needs two
  distinct work signals in one sample. It is never paused.
* the **spawn gate** reads every signal, host-only ones included: loop lag
  (>= 250 ms) and memory at the critical line are each sufficient alone, and
  severe pressure pauses it at its floor. It bounds how many backend processes
  fork and initialize at once, which IS a host question.

Each track earns its increases on its own evidence (completions for the exec
track, successful backend inits for the gate) and only when demand is actually
at its limit, so an idle track never drifts up.

Rules, with fixed tuning constants owned by this module:

* **Decrease** (multiplicative). Only on CORROBORATED pressure for that track.
  Exec: ``max(ceil(cap * 0.5), healthy_in_flight)``, at most ``cap - 1``, never
  below the floor: halving is the lower bound, but a cut below the work that is
  currently succeeding frees nothing (nothing is ever killed) and would only be
  undone. That is what turns 10 concurrent starts with 4 timing out into 6, then
  4. Gate: ``ceil(cap * 0.5)`` at most ``cap - 1``, never below its floor.
  Cooldown 30 s between decreases, per track; the successes counted before a
  decrease are discarded on the track that was cut, and only there -- a track
  that did not move keeps the successes it has earned.
* **Increase**. Two regimes, one rule each. The exec bound is the user's
  configured ceiling (``exec_ceiling``: an explicit ``max_subagents``, or
  ``agent.subagent_auto_max`` when it is 0), which stands in for provider
  concurrency and fd/PID limits; no host prediction sits under it.

  * **Slow start**, until this process meets its first corroborated pressure or
    pause: ``x2`` per clean sample window (``slow_start_clean_secs``, 5 s),
    once ``slow_start_successes`` (1) completions land and demand is at the
    cap. Only a cap below its ceiling uses it -- the exec track STARTS at the
    ceiling -- so it is what a lowered cap or a raised ceiling climbs with.
  * **Congestion avoidance**, afterwards: ``+1`` per ``increase_clean_secs``
    (30 s) window, once demand is at the cap and enough work has landed:
    ``min(increase_successes, cap)`` completions on the exec track -- one full
    wave of the CURRENT cap -- and ``increase_successes`` on the gate, whose
    counter is backend inits rather than finished runs.

  Each track also requires the sample to be clear of ITS evidence and at least
  one window since its last pressure: the exec track no work signal, the gate
  no signal at all plus the hysteresis band (lag < 100 ms, memory >= the
  pressure line).
* **Idle recovery**. A cut is evidence about the work that was running when
  it fired. Once the exec track has had no demand at all (nothing running or
  queued) and no work signal for ``idle_recovery_secs`` (60 s), that evidence
  is stale, yet the earn rules above can never retire it: they need demand at
  the cap and completions, and an idle track -- or one whose load runs on the
  runner lane, which the exec track does not count -- produces neither. So a
  cap below the fresh-start value climbs ``+1`` per clean window while that
  holds. The bound is the fresh-start cap (the ceiling, unless a test pins
  ``exec_initial``). Any work signal restarts the idle clock.
* **Pause and probe** (spawn gate only). Severe pressure (memory below
  critical, or loop lag beyond 2 s) for two consecutive samples holds the gate
  at its floor. Once the severe condition clears, the gate probes: when a
  completion lands without pressure it resumes at ``floor + 1``; an idle host
  resumes it at the floor. A probe that meets corroborated pressure re-pauses.
  The execution cap is untouched throughout.
* **Provider throttling** never reaches the host caps. Throttled scopes are
  reported on the decision for the dependency coordinator (area L).
* **Fresh start**: the exec track at its ceiling, the gate at its initial
  value. A raised ceiling is followed at once while the exec cap sits at the
  old one (nothing cut it); a cap below it earns the room.
* **Why the cap is low** is on the snapshot: ``last_cut`` is the decision that
  last lowered the exec cap (action, reason, signals, sample time), and a hold
  names what the next increase is waiting for (demand at the cap, completions,
  or the idle clock).
* ``mode == "fixed"`` returns the initial caps forever (Q2 reversal).
