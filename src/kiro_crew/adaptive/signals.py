"""Signals the adaptive controller reads, and the pure pressure classifier.

A :class:`Sample` is one periodic observation of the host and of the two
admission points (the gateway's subagent cap and the daemon's spawn gate).
:func:`classify` turns a sample into a :class:`PressureReport` -- WHICH
signals fired, whether they corroborate each other, whether the pressure is
severe enough to pause dispatch, and which provider scopes are throttled.

Three things the classifier deliberately keeps apart:

* **Work evidence** (fd/proc counts, start latency, attributable timeouts,
  completion rate, slow MCP servers, spawn-gate init failures) says whether the
  work already admitted is failing. It drives BOTH caps, the subagent
  execution cap and the spawn gate, and only when two distinct signals
  corroborate each other (:attr:`PressureReport.exec_corroborated`).
* **Host-only evidence** (:data:`HOST_ONLY_SIGNALS`: the gateway's own loop
  lag and free memory) shapes the spawn gate alone. The execution cap never
  reads it: free memory is the per-start spawn floor's to judge
  (``agent.spawn_min_memory_gb``), and the gateway's loop lag says nothing
  about whether a subagent's own process is healthy. A lag spike that halved
  the execution cap throttled every chat's subagents at once.
* **Provider throttling** (per-provider 429s) is scoped to that provider's
  dependency channel. It is reported, never counted as a host signal: one
  provider's rate limit must not halve the concurrency every other provider
  still has (SPEC 二.3, addendum §4).

Errors that are not congestion -- permission denied, invalid params, context
length, deny-rule refusals -- are the caller's job to exclude before they
reach ``attributable_timeout_rate``; this module only reads the rate.
