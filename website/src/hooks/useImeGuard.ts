 *

 * document/window listener (which never sees a synthetic event, so
 * `useImeGuard().claimEnter` cannot consume for it) claims with `claimKey(e)`;
 * a React `onKeyDown` on the dialog panel claims with `claimSyntheticKey(e)`,
 * which adds the synthetic propagation half React needs. What makes the latch
 * document-tracked is the composing input's position, not the handler's
 * flavour — see the tracking note below.
 *
 * Composition tracking listens at DOCUMENT capture: the composing input is
 * anywhere inside the dialog, so element-scoped listeners have nothing
 * reliable to attach to.
 *
 * `enabled` keys the tracking lifecycle and nothing else, so the latch
 * survives the host's own re-renders: the commit's input event re-renders the
 * host right before the committing keydown arrives, and a latch reset riding
 * along on that churn would clear the post-composition window at exactly the
 * moment it matters. A re-enabled latch does NOT inherit state from its
 * disabled span — a composition that ended (or was abandoned) while the latch
 * was off would otherwise strand it.
 *
 * Stranded-latch recovery ships with the tracking: a composition abandoned
 * WITHOUT `compositionend` (focus moves off the input mid-composition, an
 * OS-level IME cancel) would otherwise leave the latch set — and a latched
 * guard consumes the keys it declines, so the trap would silently stop
 * cycling for the dialog's lifetime. `focusout` at document capture is the
 * recovery signal.
 *
 * The returned latch is identity-stable for the host's lifetime (it lives in
 * a ref), so listing it in an effect dependency array never re-runs the
 * effect.

/**
 * Guard against IME composition Enter falsely triggering submit handlers.
 *
 * IME (Chinese/Japanese/Korean) sends a final Enter to commit the composition.
 * React's synthetic `isComposing` is sometimes false on that final Enter, so
 * this hook layers multiple guards:
 *
 *   1. the tracked latch (`createImeLatch`) - true from compositionStart until
 *                                    50ms after compositionEnd (timer-based)
 *   2. `e.nativeEvent.isComposing` - native browser flag
 *   3. `e.keyCode === 229`         - "IME processing" keyCode some browsers
 *                                    emit while composition is in flight even
 *                                    after isComposing flips to false
 *
 * **Sharing a single hook instance across multiple inputs:** If the hosting
 * component unmounts an input mid-composition (e.g. Escape cancels a rename
 * and removes the input from the tree), `compositionEnd` will never fire and
 * the latch would stay set forever, blocking Enter on every input that
 * shares this hook. Recovery therefore ships WITH the tracking: the only
 * composition binding this hook exposes carries the blur reset, so a surface
 * cannot opt out of it by omission. That matters more now than it used to,
 * because `claimEnter` also consumes the keypresses a latched guard declines —
 * the failure mode is a surface that silently stops sending rather than one
 * that visibly inserts newlines.
 *
 * **A swallowed Enter still has to be consumed.** Deciding not to submit is not
 * the same as declining the keypress: on a multiline input the browser's default
 * for an Enter nobody claimed is to insert a literal newline, so a guard that
 * returns early without `preventDefault` turns "this Enter belongs to the IME"
 * into "corrupt the user's draft". `claimEnter` exists so no call site has to
 * remember that. It suppresses the default only where the browser would
 * otherwise act — both native signals clear — and leaves a keypress the IME is
 * itself consuming alone. The window this matters in is not hypothetical: the
 * latch timer above outlives the native signals by 50ms, and a fast
 * typist's send lands inside it.
 *
 * Usage (simple Enter/Escape inputs):
 *   const ime = useImeGuard()
 *   <input {...ime.bindEnter({ onEnter: submit, onEscape: cancel, onBlur: commit })} />
 *
 * Usage (custom onKeyDown logic):
 *   <textarea
 *     {...ime.bindComposition()}
 *     onKeyDown={e => {
 *       if (e.key === 'Enter' && !e.shiftKey) { if (ime.claimEnter(e)) submit(); return }
 *       if (e.key === 'Escape') { ime.reset(); ... }
 *     }}
