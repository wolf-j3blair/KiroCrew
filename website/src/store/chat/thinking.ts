 *  at the tail only while the pure server page does not cover that boundary

 *  below unrelated newer turns, re-appended on every refresh. A block whose
 *  anchor MISSES its lookup is dropped or kept by where the anchor sits
 *  relative to the region the PURE server page (`coverageSource`) actually
 *  covers:
 *
 *  - **Inside the covered region** (at or before the last `existing` row that
 *    `incoming` recognizably contains), with a server-confirmed anchor (a
 *    server-minted tool id, or answer text carrying a server `ts`): the
 *    snapshot covers that span of history yet does not contain the anchor —
 *    the block's position is gone (a bounded page: `switchSlot` on an idle
 *    slot fetches only `OLDER_PAGE_LIMIT` rows, while preserved blocks span
 *    the whole tab lifetime). DROP it. Appending those used to stack every
 *    out-of-window block from hours of turns as a wall of bare "Thinking"
 *    chips at the transcript tail, re-appended on every later refresh
 *    (#5798). Dropping matches what a full page reload does anyway —
 *    reasoning is client-only and never survives one.
 *  - **Past the covered region** (the anchor row is newer than everything the
 *    snapshot knows): a racing mid-turn refresh (WS reconnect) snapshots the
 *    server, then a tool frame or more streamed text lands BEFORE the fetch
 *    fulfills — the anchor is absent from `incoming` because the snapshot is
 *    older than it, not because history dropped it. KEEP the block (tail
 *    append; the live turn is the tail). The same applies to an anchor that
 *    was never server-confirmed (a `streaming` row, or a text row without a
 *    server `ts`) — its text can grow past what any snapshot holds.
 *
 *  Coverage is measured conservatively: the last `existing` row whose identity
 *  (tool id / `mid` / role+`ts` / role+text) appears in `incoming`. When
 *  nothing matches, nothing is dropped — declining to guess loses at worst a
 *  misplaced chip, while guessing wrong deletes live reasoning.
 *
 *  The anchor is the FOLLOWING TOOL CALL's `tool_call_id` when there is one, and
 *  the following answer text only otherwise. A tool id is the sharper key and
 *  the only one that scales: `_tool_meta` mints it server-side and persists it on
 *  the tool row, so it survives into history and reads back identically on a
 *  historical replay. Answer content does not scale, because a turn that reasons
 *  before each of N tool calls emits no text at those boundaries — the backend's
 *  segment flush is gated on pending text (`chat_runner._flush_segment`, called
 *  under `if not in_tool_group and assistant_text`) — so history holds ONE
 *  assistant row for all N bursts. Anchoring every burst on that single row let
 *  exactly one land and parked the other N-1 at the tail, below the answer and
 *  its footer, as a column of collapsed rows that read as duplicates (#4218).
 *
 *  Bursts and anchors are 1:1 under the tool rule: burst k is followed by tool k,
 *  and the final burst by the answer. An auto-approved call emits two tool rows
 *  sharing one id (🔧 pre-approval + ✅ post-approval, see
 *  `applyToolOutputToMessages`); `used` makes the first win, which is the earlier
 *  row and so the correct side of the pair.
 *
 *  A block this function decides has no position here is handed to
 *  `orphanSink` when the caller supplied one, rather than discarded:
 *  `state.messages` is its only copy, so a later page that loads its anchor
 *  can re-seat it. With no sink it is dropped as before. Either way it
 *  leaves the rendered list, so the #5798 tail wall stays cured. */

/** Re-insert parked reasoning blocks whose anchoring row is now loaded.
 *  Returns the new list plus the blocks still waiting for their anchor.
 *
 *  `windowComplete` is required rather than defaulted so the compiler names every
 *  call site — the hazard `hydrateQueuedBubbles` records at the three near-identical
 *  slot-detail reducers.
 *
 *  A TEXT-ONLY anchor needs a complete window: while it is incomplete the genuine
 *  anchor may sit above it, so the one loaded row carrying that text belongs to a
 *  different turn. Once complete, a REPEATED text is resolved by the occurrence
 *  recorded at park time, and a count that GREW invalidates that ordinal. An exact
 *  `mid` or server `ts` bypasses both: text AND ts is strictly more evidence than
 *  text AND ordinal, and withholding it hid the block permanently. Tool ids are
 *  1:1 with bursts (#4578) and need none of this. */
