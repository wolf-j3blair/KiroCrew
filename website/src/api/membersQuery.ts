 *
 * Roster freshness follows the dashboard's sanctioned pattern (see
 * queryClient.ts): pushed invalidation first, a finite staleTime as the floor.
 * The roster is a projection of the crew registry, so its key lives UNDER
 * `['kirocrew-agents']` — the prefix useWebSocket invalidates on every
 * `refresh` frame and the crew editor invalidates after a save — and a crew
 * created, renamed or starred anywhere reaches this cache without the page
 * knowing who wrote. The second segment keeps it a distinct entry: the
 * registry query returns `{ agents, default_agent }`, this one returns rows,
 * and sharing one key would let whichever mounted first decide the shape.

 *
 * The list response carries the `roster` view alone, because that is the only one
 * a list ROW paints. The drawer paints the activity timeline, the patrol state and
 * the driven-slot list, so without this read those blocks would have no baseline
 * until a live frame happened to arrive -- a member that has not moved since the
 * gateway started would show an empty drawer indefinitely.
 *
 * Seeding rather than returning the views to a caller keeps ONE source of truth on
 * the client: `useMemberProjection` already reads the store and already prefers a
 * live frame over a baseline through the store's higher-seq-wins rule, so a frame
 * that arrives while this request is in flight is not overwritten by it. The
 * consumers read the store; which request filled it is not theirs to know.
 *
 * A negative `asOfSeq` is NOT seeded from here. In the store that value is the
 * roster's refusal to attribute a slug, and it clears the slug's whole cache and
 * mutes the live frames that follow. This route never means that by it: a member
 * with no log yet answers an empty baseline at a real sequence, and every case the
 * roster refuses answers 409, so a negative here is only a read this route could
 * not stand behind. Muting a row that is displaying correctly is the wrong answer
 * to that, and attribution stays the roster list's to decide.
 *
 * Which is why the values go in through `apply` per key rather than `seed`. `seed`
 * LIFTS a refusal the roster has made -- that is how the mark is meant to clear,
 * on a roster baseline carrying a real sequence -- and this route has no standing
 * to do that. React Query re-runs a select over whatever block is cached, so a
 * block held from before a refusal would otherwise restore the pre-failure values
 * and re-admit live frames, with `data` still defined so no error state shows.
 * `apply` drops its input for a refused slug and never clears the mark, and it is
 * higher-seq-wins, so re-running it over the same block changes nothing. The empty
 * blocks this route can answer need none of `seed`'s truncation either: a logless
 * member's baseline is one the roster has already applied at the same sequence.
