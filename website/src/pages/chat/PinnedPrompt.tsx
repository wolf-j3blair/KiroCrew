/**
 * The most recent prompt that has scrolled fully behind the band, pinned under

 *
 * The card is a pixel-for-pixel copy of the user bubble's own box — same
 * `px-4 mx-auto` content column, right-aligned, the bubble's own `max-w-full`
 * cap (so both follow Settings → Chat → Content Width, #8398), `px-4 py-2
 * rounded-xl bg-card text-sm` with an inner `my-1 leading-6` paragraph —
 * because the transcript row it represents is hidden while it is pinned (see
 * ChatPage's row `visibility`; the row's action strip beneath the bubble is
 * re-shown in place by index.css's `[data-pinned-standin]` rule, since this card
 * copies the bubble and nothing below it). For a one-line prompt the two are the
 * same size at the same place at the moment of hand-off, so the bubble appears to
 * stop travelling and stick rather than being replaced. A taller prompt hands
 * over at the same line — its row top on the fold (`pinHandoffY`) — and the card
 * then folds down the bubble's remaining height (`liveH`), so the swap is still a
 * box replaced by an identical box. The
 * box also carries the bubble's `user-bubble` theme hook, so a theme that tints
 * the bubble (kiro-light) tints the card identically and the swap stays
 * invisible there too. Keep
 * these values in sync with `UserMessage`'s `bubble` and with `MD_COMPONENTS.p`
 * in MarkdownRenderer.
 *
 * Deliberate details that protect that equality:
 *   - No `border`. The bubble has none, so a 1px border made the card 2px taller
 *     and shifted its text 1px off the edge — the box visibly changed size as it
 *     pinned. The visible edge is an INSET RING (`ring-1 ring-inset forced-colors:border`) instead: it
 *     is painted as a box-shadow, so it reads as a 1px border at zero layout
 *     cost. Do not swap it back to `border-*`.
 *     Pair it with `shadow-sm`, NOT `shadow-md`: the `--shadow-md` token carries
 *     its own outset hairline (`0 0 0 1px`), which is 3% white in dark themes
 *     (invisible) but 4% black in light ones — one pixel outside our inset ring,
 *     so light mode rendered a visible DOUBLE border. `--shadow-sm` has no ring.
 *   - `items-start` on the band is LOAD-BEARING, not cosmetic. The band's height
 *     is driven by the push (`ROW_PAD_Y * 2 + bannerH - pushUp` below) and the
 *     card is its flex item with no height of its own, so under the default
 *     `align-items: normal` the card is STRETCHED to whatever height the push
 *     leaves — and the card is the element ChatPage measures for `bannerH`. That
 *     closes a loop: pushing shrinks the band, the shrunk band shrinks the
 *     measured card, the smaller `bannerH` shrinks `pinPushTravel`, and the
 *     drop-when-cleared threshold fires against a moving target. Measured with
 *     the real class list: at pushUp 20 the 34.75px card reported 22.75px, and at
 *     full push it reported 0. `items-start` keeps the card at its natural height
 *     so the measurement is a fixed point.
 *   - The chevron takes its room from the TEXT, never from the box, and it only
 *     appears once the text is actually clamped. That gate is what keeps the
 *     box honest: a clamped line means the card has already hit its max width,
 *     so inserting the chevron cannot widen it — it only narrows the text
 *     further. A short prompt is unclamped, gets no chevron, and keeps hugging
 *     its text exactly like the bubble does. The two states are each stable, so
 *     the measurement below cannot oscillate: "overflowing at width W" still
 *     overflows at W minus the chevron.
 *   - Images are shown as thumbnails rather than dropped. `promptPreview` strips
 *     image markdown from the text, so a prompt whose entire content was an
 *     image used to pin as a blank card.
 *
 * Three heights, one box. At REST the text is clamped to `PINNED_RESTING_LINES`
 * (one line) so the card costs the reply beneath it as little as possible. While
 * the pointer is over the card, or a control inside it has keyboard focus, the
 * clamp opens to `PINNED_PREVIEW_LINES` — the PEEK — and closes again on leave.
 * The chevron still EXPANDS to the whole prompt. Every transition between the
 * three runs through the same height morph below, so the card is visibly one
 * object changing size rather than two things swapping (the failure #8714
 * reverted). The peek is pointer-and-keyboard only: a touch `pointerenter` is
 * ignored, because a tap has no matching leave and the card would stick open.
 * The peek and the expansion grow the LIVE card, which the push geometry reads;
 * neither ever re-reports the collapsed height, so the hand-off line stays on
 * the resting height and a hover cannot move it. The peek also closes as soon
 * as the card is being pushed out, so a departing card is always its resting
 * size and the band it slides through is sized for it.
