/**
 * The body of a RESTORED file tab, before anything has read the file.
 *
 * A persisted tab carries only metadata -- its buffer and its `binary` verdict
 * are both stripped on save -- so until a read lands, nothing about the file is
 * known. Mounting the editor on that empty buffer is not merely blank: a
 * restored `.zip` tab would offer a live editor over bytes that cannot be
 * decoded, and typing then saving would write text over the file. So this
 * placeholder renders instead, and it performs the read ITSELF rather than
 * leaning on one page's effect -- every host that mounts `SidePanel` (the chat
 * page and the members page) restores file tabs, and only a read that lives
 * here resolves on both. `onDiskContent` patches the buffer, the saved baseline
 * and the verdict together, which is what swaps this placeholder for the panel.
 *
 * A read that fails is shown AS a failure, not left on the skeleton: a skeleton
 * that never resolves reads as "still loading". Both strings it needs already
 * exist -- the notice's title is the panel's own `cannot_read_file`, and a 404
 * reuses the placeholder sentence `openFile` writes for a moved file.
 *
 * The read goes through `['file-read', path]`, the same React Query entry the
 * chip click and ChatPage's cold-tab hydration use, so a restored tab that BOTH
 * this placeholder and that page ask for costs one GET and yields one answer
 * rather than two racing reads of the same file.
