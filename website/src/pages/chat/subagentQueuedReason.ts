 * Why a slot's queued subagents are waiting -- the `reason` the gateway puts on

 *
 * The count alone made every chip say "queued behind the concurrency limit",
 * including for a wave the MEMORY guard parked: on a 16 GB laptop that read as
 * "cap 4, queue 1, blocked by the cap" and never cleared, while the real cause
 * sat only in the gateway log. The gate now labels the wait it decided on and
 * the chips render the label. Nothing here decides anything: it reads a field
 * the backend already emitted.
 *
 * Backward compatible by construction: an event with no `reason` (an older
 * gateway) parses to `undefined`, and `queuedWaitText` then returns `null`, so
 * every chip falls back to the text it showed before. The `concurrency_limit`
 * kind ALSO resolves to `null` on purpose -- it is the ordinary wave shape and
 * the existing text already describes it.
