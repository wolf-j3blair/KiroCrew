/**
 * Shared async confirmation surface, replacing `window.confirm`.
 *
 * Native `confirm` is synchronous: it freezes the renderer's event loop, so a
 * Quit event queued behind it fires the instant it dismisses — tearing the app
 * down before the follow-up request is sent. It also leaks the origin string
 * into an unthemeable OS sheet and cannot restate the action on its button.
 * This dialog is the themed, non-blocking replacement: the confirm button
 * restates the action instead of "OK", and the caller awaits a boolean.
 *
 * The confirm button is always styled destructively and the cancel label is
 * always the shared one: every current caller confirms a destructive act, so
 * the knobs would ship without a consumer. Add them when a caller needs them.

 * only when the user presses the confirm button; Cancel, Escape, the X
 * button, and a backdrop click all resolve `false`. Render `confirmDialog`
 * once in the component's JSX.
 *
 * Unlike `window.confirm`, the UI stays live while the dialog is open, so a
 * caller that reads mutable state after the `await` must re-read or capture
 * it — the answer can arrive an arbitrary time later. A component that owns a
 * document-level keyboard handler should skip it entirely while `confirmOpen`
 * is true: Escape would re-trigger the guard the dialog just dismissed, and a
 * save shortcut would persist the draft the user is about to discard.
