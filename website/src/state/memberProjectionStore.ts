/**
 * Framework-free per-member projection store.
 *
 * Holds the latest projected value per (slug, key), fed by two WebSocket
 * frames and a roster baseline. Four invariants keep it correct against
 * replays, races, and server restarts:
 *
 *   - generation-then-seq-wins: apply() compares (stateVersion, seq) in that
 *     order, so an older generation loses outright and within one generation a
 *     replayed or out-of-order seq is a no-op. A deletion arrives at an advanced
 *     generation, which is what lets it outrank a row sitting at a high seq.
 *   - a deletion RETAINS NOTHING: a null value drops the row rather than holding
 *     a tombstone, because a re-enabled app picks its own stateVersion and cannot
 *     know which generation the server advanced to -- a tombstone would discard
 *     its real updates. Refusing a publish from the RETIRED generation is not
 *     this layer's job: teardown revokes the grant before deleting rows and the
 *     publish path commits behind a generation fence, so the server does not
 *     send one.
 *   - an ATTRIBUTABLE baseline never truncates: while the roster stands behind
 *     a slug's sequence, seed() only applies values, so a live frame that raced
 *     ahead of the baseline keeps winning.
 *   - an UNATTRIBUTABLE baseline (asOfSeq < 0) clears the slug and refuses its
 *     frames. That sentinel is not a sequence, so nothing can be compared
 *     against it, and the state it would otherwise leave on screen belongs to
 *     whichever member last held the slug. See seed().
 *   - truncate only from the subscribed frame: rows with seq > lastSeq are
 *     dropped ONLY when the server tells us (members_subscribed), which is the
 *     one moment we learn a torn tail was rolled back after a restart.
 *
 * faceOf() exposes a useSyncExternalStore-shaped view per (slug, key) whose
 * snapshot is referentially stable until that row actually changes.

   *   emits when it will not attribute the slug -- a collision, a header naming
   *   another member, or a read that failed -- and every real row's seq is above
   *   it, so comparing them keeps the whole cache instead of dropping it: the
   *   clear fails on precisely the case it exists for. The slug is therefore
   *   cleared UNCONDITIONALLY and marked unattributable, which also refuses the
   *   live frames that reach {@link apply} from the publish and replay paths,
   *   neither of which checks attribution. The mark lifts the moment the roster
   *   sends a baseline carrying a real sequence.
   *
   * The sentinel governs the whole block, not just an empty one: a value carried
   * at a sequence the server would not stand behind is not a baseline, so it is
   * dropped rather than applied at a negative seq that every later frame beats.
