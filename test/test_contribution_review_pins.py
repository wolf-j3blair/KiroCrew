"""Pins for the defects the review found on this branch.

Three separate mechanisms, each of which passed every other test in the suite:

* a catch-up read that answered from the in-memory tail, so a cold subscriber on a
  long log folded the newest events and silently never saw the older ones;
* an app removed through the CLI keeping its contributed projection rows, which the
  Members drawer treats as authority and renders;
* a route registered against a handler that does not exist, which raises at
  dashboard startup and which no test noticed because nothing exercised
  registration.

The third pin is deliberately broader than this feature: it walks EVERY dashboard
route module, because the failure was not specific to this change and the next one
would be found the same way -- by a reviewer, or by a gateway that will not boot.
