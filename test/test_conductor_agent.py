"""Conductor agent installer + bundled acceptance evaluator.

``kirocrew-conductor`` IS the work-ledger conductor: it mounts ``kirocrew-work``,
dispatches bind-before-seed, and settles every ``done`` claim with the bundled
``scripts/accept_eval.py``. ``kirocrew-ledger-conductor`` is a deprecated alias
emitting this same spec under its old name for one release, and the proof that
the two cannot drift lives in ``test_ledger_conductor_agent.py``.

The installer test mirrors the research-agent installer test's shape: stub the
agents dir and ``build_agent_config``, run the installer, assert on the JSON it
wrote. The evaluator tests run the real script over stdin/stdout — it is the
deterministic half of the conductor's patrol, so its verdict vocabulary is
pinned here.

The ``cmd`` fixtures deliberately use ``git`` rather than ``sys.executable``:
bare interpreters are NOT on the evaluator's allowlist (a spec could otherwise
name ``python -c <payload>``), and pinning that is one of the tests below.
