"""The MCP half of the ability card is a PROJECTION, and these tests keep it one.

The capability half already had its guards (``test_backend_cards``). This half
reads a different source -- the declarations in ``providers/mirrors`` -- so it has
its own failure modes, and each test below is one cost the card exists to stop
paying:

1. **Completeness under a new harness.** A selectable backend with no section is
   the invisible-difference failure the mirror folder exists to prevent, so the
   card must answer for every one of them. Not by GUESSING: an undeclared id
   answers ``""``, and the test asserts that too.
2. **Completeness under a new spec concern.** ``Concern`` is closed and a mirror
   must rule on every member, so a member added there must be either ON the card
   or recorded in :data:`~kiro_crew.agent_sdk.backend_mcp_ability.OFF_CARD_CONCERNS`
   with the reason it is not. A concern in neither is one nobody decided about.
3. **Completeness under a new kind or reach.** Every ``ProjectionKind`` and every
   ``PerToolDeny`` member must reach the wire as its own value, and doctor must
   have a phrase for it -- otherwise a harness declaring the new one renders a card
   that silently says nothing about the thing that makes it different.
4. **No per-harness prose.** The module may not name a harness id: the moment it
   does, onboarding costs an edit here and the projection has become a table.
5. **The declaration is what reaches the reader.** The shipped values are asserted
   end to end, because a declaration nothing renders is not a feature.

It DECLARES. Nothing here asserts that any backend enforces a per-tool MCP deny,
because two of them cannot and are not asked to.
