"""Phase 0 guardrails for unattended, app-owned chat slots.

Three defects, each of which makes a fleet of unattended worker slots unusable.
Every test here is written to go RED if its own fix is reverted.

FIX 1 — the dashboard approval path parked for two hours.
    ``chat_runner._run_chat`` waited on its OWN per-slot approval future with a
    hardcoded ``timeout=7200.0``, so it never reached the deny-fast branch that
    ``DashboardState.request_approval`` already had. An unattended worker that
    tripped one untrusted tool held its slot for 2h and then denied anyway.

FIX 2 — nothing capped concurrency.
    Chat slots and concurrent turns were both uncapped; the only real ceiling
    was a 4-wide semaphore on agent cold starts plus host memory.

FIX 3 — idle cleanup permanently destroyed an autonudge loop.
    ``api_chat_slots_cleanup`` marked an idle slot closed; the nudge fire path
    then rehydrated WITHOUT ``adopt_closed=True``, could not reach a closed
    slot, and REMOVED the loop — terminally. An unattended worker is idle by
    nature between cycles, so the 3-day heuristic shot the longest-lived loops.

FIX 4 — a scoped auto-approve grant was cached as a session approval policy.
    ``_run_chat`` wrote ``session.approval_policy = "auto"`` whenever the slot was
    trusted, including by a ``SafetyOverride`` SCOPED grant. That policy is read
    later, by the subagent spawn gate and by each subagent's own policy, where
    nothing re-checks the grant — so revoking the scope mid-turn left a live turn
    auto-approving subagent tools off the stale value.
