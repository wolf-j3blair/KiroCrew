"""The push-verdict handler's plumbing and refusal branches, exercised directly.

The ordering tests in ``test_push_verdict_gate.py`` drive the route with every git read and
the guard subprocess stubbed, so the spawn plumbing (``_run_git``), the mirror priming and
resolution helpers, and several refusal branches never run there. These tests reach those
paths without a real sandbox spawn: the single subprocess chokepoint is stubbed at
``create_subprocess_limited`` and the spawn preparation at ``shielded_prepare_off_loop``, so
what executes is the module's own control flow, not a namespace launcher the test host may
not permit.

The handler module is imported lazily inside each test, the convention the sibling gate file
follows, because eagerly importing ``kiro_crew.dashboard.handlers`` at module scope drags in
the whole handler package and collides with the coverage plugin's re-import.
