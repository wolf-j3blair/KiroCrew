"""Runner-lane load earns an exec-cap increase, not only a cut.

The adaptive exec track reads demand, completions and progress from the
sub-agent manager. Workflow ``ctx.agent()`` and TaskRunner steps run on the
runner lane instead, so their load could cut the cap (start timeouts feed
``record_start``) but never earn a step above the fresh-start value. These
tests pin that a lane the controller reads feeds the SAME ``Sample`` fields:
occupancy as demand, committed ``done`` settles as completions, fresh settles
as progress -- and that the lane's own completion counter counts a committed
``done``, never a grant or a fail/cancel.
