"""Each launcher mask binds the object its own check inspected, not a re-read name.

Every hiding mount in the namespace launcher needs two answers about one target:
what KIND of object is there, and then mount over it. Taking those from two
separate lookups of the same NAME leaves a window: a name swapped in between is
classified as the old object and bound as the new one, so the mask attaches to
whatever the name points at by then while the bytes it exists to cover sit at a
name nothing masks. The crew data home is writable by an already-running
sandboxed process, so the racing writer is ordinary rather than exotic.

The tests here LOSE that race deliberately and then ask what the mount actually
received. The swap is planted at a synchronisation point every version of the
loop passes through -- the ``tempfile`` call that creates the empty stand-in,
which sits after the classification and before the mount in both the pinned and
the name-based shape -- so one test body discriminates between them instead of
asserting a call shape.

``_FakeLibc`` resolves each target AT MOUNT TIME and records the device and
inode it reached, because that is the question: ``mount(2)`` walks the target
path exactly as ``stat`` does, so what the recorded path resolves to in that
moment is what the kernel would bind. A pinned ``/proc/self/fd/<fd>`` target is
only resolvable while the descriptor is open, which is precisely why the
resolution happens inside the fake rather than after the run.

Like the sibling mount suite, these run the region lifted VERBATIM out of the
shipped launcher, so they cannot drift from what executes in the child, and each
behavioural assertion has a break-arm that mutates the shipped source back to
the name-based form and shows the assertion's own value moves.
