"""In-band delivery of a tool-deny reason (steer-before-reject).

kiro-cli reports every rejected permission to the model as the fixed tool result
"User denied tool execution" — ACP's permission response carries only
``outcome``/``optionId``, so the host has no protocol field for a reason. The
agent therefore concluded the USER cancelled and yielded, and the reason only
reached it via a second, billed recovery turn.

These tests pin the primary path that removes that second turn: the deny site
steers a policy notice into the still-running turn BEFORE answering the
permission request, and the recovery continuation degrades to a fallback that
fires only when the notice could not be delivered.
