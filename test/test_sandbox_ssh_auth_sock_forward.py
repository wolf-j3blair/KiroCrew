"""SSH_AUTH_SOCK forward opt-in.

The agent sandbox scrubs SSH_AUTH_SOCK by default, which breaks git commit
signing with a passphrase-protected SSH key held by the operator's ssh-agent
(the agent socket is the only reachable path to the key). This module pins the
opt-in as a MECHANICAL property.

The forward decision is a boolean resolved ONCE off the event loop on the agent
spawn path (via _forward_ssh_auth_sock) and threaded into the scrub sites as an
explicit parameter (never read from config inside the generic launchers). Two
consequences this module pins:
  - config I/O stays off the loop (the scrubbers take a bool, they do not read
    config);
  - the forward is scoped to agent spawns: the generic launcher builders and
    scrub_env default the flag off, so a non-agent caller (a third-party app
    openCommand going through the generic wrap_argv launcher, a
    sandboxed_spawn_argv spawn) never re-admits the socket.

Every negative assertion (a key removed / not forwarded) is paired with a
positive control taken with the SAME method, so a scrub that silently stopped
working could not pass as an SSH forward.
