"""The opencode session MCP array: its projection, and the adapter facts it rests on.

Two halves, deliberately in one file. The unit half drives
:mod:`kiro_crew.providers.mirrors.opencode` over a temp agent spec. The
:func:`test_real_opencode_acp_accepts_the_crew_stdio_element` half drives a real
``opencode acp`` and is the anti-drift guard for the whole projection: this backend
had NO projection at all because an adapter fact was inferred from its
``initialize`` result rather than measured, and the inference was wrong. A
measurement that lives beside the code it licenses is the only thing that stops
that happening a second time in the other direction.

    *cwd* is required rather than defaulted, and it is a temp directory in both

    invitation for the next edit to write one relative path and land it in the

    reaches every descendant; the kill runs on every exit because a clean reap leaves
    an empty group and makes it a no-op. Routed through
    ``platform_compat.kill_process_tree`` so it is not POSIX-only and keeps the

    """ANTI-DRIFT GUARD, and the measurement this whole projection rests on.

    Six facts, none documented by the harness and all of which the mirror depends
    on:

    1. The element Crew already emits -- ``{"name", "command", "args", "env",
       "type": "stdio"}``, the claude shape unchanged -- is ACCEPTED. This is the
       fact whose absence was INFERRED, from an ``initialize`` result advertising
       ``mcpCapabilities`` of ``http`` and ``sse``. ACP's ``McpCapabilities`` has
       exactly those two boolean fields and no ``stdio`` field, so no conforming
       agent can advertise stdio and the absence was never evidence.
    2. The server is really LAUNCHED and its tools listed: the child answers
       ``initialize`` and then ``tools/list``. Acceptance alone would leave a
       session holding a mounted server with no usable tool.
    3. The element's ``env`` REACHES the child, which is what makes
       ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` on the element the thing that scopes Crew's control
       plane to this session rather than to the gateway.
    4. Dropping the ``type`` key is EQUIVALENT, which is what licenses leaving the
       tag on rather than adding a second element shape to the shared translator.
       The tag is tolerated and discarded, not honoured -- so nothing may read
       meaning into it.
    5. ``http`` and ``sse`` elements are BOTH accepted, which is why this backend
       needs no analogue of codex's transport filter. A filter here would remove
       servers the harness would have mounted.
    6. A MALFORMED element fails the WHOLE ``session/new``, in BOTH the shapes a
       hand-edited spec produces -- no ``command``, and an ``env`` that is a mapping
       rather than an array of pairs. This is the opposite of codex, which drops the
       element and succeeds, and it is why ``acp_server_element``'s skip discipline
       is load-bearing rather than tidy.

    No credential and no model are needed: ``initialize`` and ``session/new`` make
    no model call, so nothing is sent anywhere. Every case runs under its own
    ``HOME`` and ``XDG_*`` tree, so the operator's own opencode configuration is
    neither read nor written.

    Skips where the harness is absent, and FAILS instead where a lane declares it
    must be there. Its companion
    :func:`test_the_real_adapter_guard_is_reachable_at_all` is what keeps the skip
    from becoming permanent silence.
