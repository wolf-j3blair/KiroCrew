"""Re-resolving the main checkout inside one process.

``ensure_main_repo_discovered`` latches only once a checkout RESOLVED, and
``worktree_ops._ensure_repo_resolved`` re-runs it from ``/api/fleet`` while nothing
is. So a gateway that starts before the operator points Dev Fleet at a checkout
serves a fleet as soon as one resolves, with no restart.

Only the ``dev_fleet.repo_path`` half of the remedy can self-heal:
``_load_dev_fleet_cfg`` re-reads ``config.json`` on every call, whereas
``KIROCREW_DEVFLEET_REPO`` is read off this process's own environment, which no
outside shell can change. The setup card's copy says so.
