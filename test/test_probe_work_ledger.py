"""The work-ledger wake gate's decision layer.

Phase 3 of ``rfc-conductor-work-ledger``. These are the exit criteria that live
in the decision layer rather than in the probe: which events wake, which only
advance the revision, that the revision is stable across a re-read of an
unchanged ledger, and the rate limit and kill switch.

Everything here runs without a gateway, which is the point of keeping the policy
out of the probe: a probe defect cannot look like a policy defect.
