"""``kiro_crew.sandbox`` stays the sandbox's import and patch surface after the split.

The Linux launcher program, the macOS Seatbelt profile and the stale mount-source sweep
are defined in ``sandbox_launcher``, ``sandbox_seatbelt`` and ``sandbox_mount_sweep``.
The facade keeps every moved name readable under its old path, and FORWARDS every one of
them, so a patch through the facade lands on the owner, where the owner's own callers
read it -- whether or not a scan could read the patched name off the test. The two
builders read the plan they render from the facade when they run, through a
function-local import, so a test that rebinds a tier list or a target helper there still
reaches them.

This file also holds what both facades share -- ``kiro_crew.sandbox`` and
``kiro_crew.platform_compat`` -- so ``test_platform_compat_refactor_facade`` runs the same
checks on its facade: the static shape of a facade module, the owner-import scan, and the
census of every facade patch in the test trees, which is read once for both facades.

The seam rows patch ONE name with a stub that raises ``_Reached`` and then drive a
function that must read that name. ``_Reached`` derives from ``BaseException`` on
purpose: several of these helpers are best-effort and swallow ``Exception``, and a stub
such a handler could swallow would let a patch that MISSED read as one that landed.
