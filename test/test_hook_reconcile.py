"""Tests for kiro_crew.apps.hook_reconcile — reload app hooks on out-of-process CLI mutation.

Feature: the CLI enable/disable/install/uninstall does not reach the
running gateway, so backend.hooks are never reloaded.

The in-process teardown/reimport itself (on_app_enable / on_app_disable /
unload_app_modules / the detached-startup machinery) is covered by
test_lifecycle_hooks.py; these tests drive the RECONCILER's decision logic.
The loaded-state is the SHARED registry in hooks_integration (record/clear/read),
not a private map, so a dashboard-driven enable/disable that updates it leaves
the reconciler nothing to re-do. The reconciler re-reads app state UNDER
app_lifecycle_lock and re-checks admission before enabling, so those are stubbed
per-test to a deterministic answer.

    authority. A NARROWING update whose in-flight commit outran the bounded drain
    deliberately retains the revocation so that retired-authority write cannot
    persist under the narrowed manifest. The reconciler's reload path drives the
    same route+hook wiring (on_app_enable) as a genuine enable, so lifting the
    tombstone there would negate that retention. This pins: transition='reload'
    (the default) never calls unrevoke; transition='enable' does.
