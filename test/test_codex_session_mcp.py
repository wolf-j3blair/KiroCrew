"""Codex's spec projection: the agent spec -> a codex ``session/new`` array.

``providers/mirrors/codex.py`` reuses claude's translation and adds two rules of
its own. Both are properties of the ADAPTER rather than of Crew, so both are
measured against a real ``codex-acp`` here and asserted as unit behaviour above:

* an ``sse`` element is dropped, because codex-acp ACCEPTS one silently and never
  wires it -- so forwarding it buys a session whose tool is missing with no error
  anywhere, and this filter is the only guard against that;
* Crew's OWN servers carry ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` on the element, because
  ``codex-rs`` launches a stdio MCP server with ``env_clear()`` plus a fixed
  allowlist and inherits nothing else -- and which servers those are is decided by
  the resolved invocation, never by the name, since that key authenticates a
  session-directive claim and the agent spec is hand-editable.

``test_real_codex_acp_accepts_the_crew_stdio_element`` is the anti-drift guard for
both: an adapter fact a projection depends on is measured against the adapter, and
this is where the measurement lives.

    Four facts, all of which the projection depends on and none of which is
    documented by the adapter:

    1. The element Crew already emits -- ``{"name", "command", "args", "env",
       "type": "stdio"}``, the claude shape unchanged -- is ACCEPTED. ACP v1 spells
       ``McpServer`` as ``serde(tag = "type")`` with stdio as the untagged
       fallback, so nothing guaranteed a ``"stdio"`` tag would fall through to it.
    2. The server is really LAUNCHED and its tools listed: the child answers
       ``initialize`` and then ``tools/list``.
    3. The child inherits ALMOST NOTHING. ``codex-rs`` runs ``env_clear()`` and
       re-adds an allowlist, so ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` arrives only because the
       element carried it -- which is why ``codex_elements`` carries it.
    4. The elements of the array decide whether ``session/new`` survives, and the
       adapter is not consistent about which ones. A meaningless
       ``{"type": "nonsense-type"}`` element is ACCEPTED -- an ordinary
       ``sessionId``, that server silently unwired -- and so is a MALFORMED stdio
       element, answered with the element dropped. An ``sse`` element is the one
       the adapter may instead name and refuse, failing the whole session. Both
       dispositions are measured rather than assumed, because each makes the
       client-side narrowing load-bearing on its own: an accepted element is a
       server no error reports missing, and a refused one is a whole session lost
       over one spec entry. What is NOT admitted is a third answer, where the
       adapter reports having wired a transport its own ``mcpCapabilities`` denies.

    A fabricated API key in a throwaway ``CODEX_HOME`` is what gets past the
    adapter's auth check, which fires BEFORE it looks at ``mcpServers`` (verified:
    without it every shape above answers ``-32000 Authentication required``
    identically, so the run would prove nothing). ``session/new`` performs no
    model call, so nothing is sent anywhere and the key never leaves the temp

    changed that -- close becoming a no-op, or silently turning into a notification
    -- every path that creates and destroys codex sessions on the shared runtime
    (background handles, warm pooled reuse, the entitlement probe) would leak one
    resident session per call, with nothing red to say so. This is where it goes red.

    Three claims, each one the harness docstring makes:

    1. Before close the session is live; after close, as a request, it is not.
       The oracle is ``session/set_config_option`` on the same id, which answers
       ``configOptions`` on a live session and an error frame on an evicted one.
    2. Close as a NOTIFICATION does not evict. This is why ``notification=False``
       is load-bearing rather than a delivery detail: the wrong form fails silent.
    3. Close is idempotent and leaves the process able to open fresh sessions, so
       a double-terminate is safe and a teardown never costs the shared process.

    Same credential arrangement as the sibling live test: a fabricated key in a
    throwaway ``CODEX_HOME`` gets past the auth check that fires before
    ``session/new``; nothing here performs a model call, so nothing leaves the box.

def test_real_codex_acp_app_server_sits_at_core_rss_depth():
    """ANTI-DRIFT GUARD for ``CodexHarness.CORE_RSS_DEPTH``.

    The core-scope recycle guard measures RSS over ``CORE_RSS_DEPTH`` generations
    below the adapter and holds that against ``CORE_RSS_CEILING_MB``. The scope
    rests on one structural fact about the installed adapter: ``codex app-server``
    is a DIRECT child of the Node process, one generation down, before any sandbox
    wrapper. Every existing pin on the constant is static -- the contract test checks
    it travels with its ceiling, the harness test checks the wrapper arithmetic, the
    runtime test checks the depth is consumed -- so an adapter release that inserts a
    launcher generation would move app-server OUT of the measured scope with nothing
    red to say so: the probe would sum a flat ~100 MB of adapter forever, the
    ceiling would never trip, and a genuine app-server leak would be invisible.
    This is where that goes red.

    Two claims:

    1. ``codex app-server`` is reachable within ``CORE_RSS_DEPTH`` of the spawned
       pid, walked by ``_iter_descendant_pids`` -- the reader the recycle guard
       itself uses, so the test measures the guard's own scope and not a proxy.
       That reader is the kernel's ``/proc`` child lists, so the pin is a Linux
       fact and is gated on Linux the way the adapter itself is gated: through
       ``require_real_adapter``, which skips a local run elsewhere and FAILS a
       lane that declared the pin must run (``KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE=1``). A
       ``skipif`` would restore the silence that gate exists to remove.
    2. It sits at exactly ``CORE_RSS_DEPTH``. A plain spawn has
       ``wrapper_generations=0``, so ``rss_depth == CORE_RSS_DEPTH`` and the constant
       IS the generation; a refused ``session/new`` fails rather than skips, because
       a silent skip is how a ratchet goes quiet.

    The constant is asserted, not resolved from the live tree: a wrong constant must
    fail here, not be quietly replaced by a runtime observation of a third-party
    process tree. ``session/new`` is sent so the walk happens after app-server has
    answered a request, not merely been forked. Same credential arrangement as the
    sibling live tests: a fabricated key in a throwaway ``CODEX_HOME`` gets past the
    auth check that fires before ``session/new``; nothing performs a model call.

def test_real_codex_acp_load_after_close_restores():
    """ANTI-DRIFT GUARD for codex's membership in ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_SHARING``.

    The sibling above measures that ``session/close`` makes the sessionId stop
    answering. That alone would argue codex OUT of sharing, and for a while it did.
    This measures the other half of the same verb: the Codex thread's own record
    SURVIVES the close, so ``session/load`` restores the conversation and a shared
    subagent stays continuable after the runtime that served it is gone.

    Three claims, each one the sharing set's comment makes:

    1. After a close, ``session/load`` on the SAME id succeeds and the session then
       answers a question only the first turn could have taught it.
    2. The same load succeeds from a RESTARTED adapter process over the same
       ``CODEX_HOME``. This is the shape ``spawn_continue`` actually takes -- the
       parent's runtime is usually dead by then -- and it is the claim that cannot be
       inferred from the first, because a same-process load could have been served
       from adapter memory.
    3. ``session/delete`` ARCHIVES the thread and a load afterwards refuses. Release
       therefore has a verb that genuinely disposes, and ``close`` is demonstrably
       not it.

    Unlike its sibling this test PROMPTS, so it needs a codex build whose credential
    this host actually holds. The spend opt-in below is the ONE gate that decides
    whether it runs; every other precondition -- codex-acp, node, ``CODEX_PATH``, a
    resolvable provider, a prompt that completes -- is a FAILURE past that gate,
    because the opt-in is a declaration that this host can run it. None of them may
    be a ``skipif``: ``test_real_adapter_gate.py`` forbids one on ``_ENTRY`` in a
    guarded file, on the ground that a skipif cannot fail and so restores exactly
    the silence the lane removes.

    It deliberately does NOT carry ``@pytest.mark.real_adapter``, and adding one would
    turn the contract lane red rather than widen its coverage. That lane installs
    adapters from a pinned manifest and then asserts on its own junit report that no
    SELECTED case was skipped; it has no model credential and does not set the spend
    opt-in below, so a marked case here would be selected and then skip, which is the
    exact shape that assertion exists to refuse. The lane's floor counts the contracts
    it can actually measure, and this one is not among them. What covers this file in
    CI is ``test_provider_config_only_excludes_process_configuration``, which carries
    no marker and no skip.

    ``CODEX_PATH`` is configuration, not consent to spend model tokens, so prompting
    also requires the dedicated opt-in. This is the only test in this file that sends
    ``session/prompt``; the other two live tests handshake and inspect session state
    without a model call, so they carry no such gate.
