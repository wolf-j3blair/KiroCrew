"""Acceptance tests for the leaked tool-call notice.

The bug: the model emits an invoke-block tool invocation into its TEXT channel
instead of executing it (observed when the target is a deferred MCP tool whose
schema is not bound, and with large nested arguments), the turn ends with zero
tool calls, and the session silently stalls — in a monitor/autonudge loop the
user only discovers it by noticing nothing happened.

The fix is NOTICE-ONLY, deliberately: an injected "re-issue that call"
continuation would carry runtime authority into sessions where the call
auto-approves (slot trust, global yolo, or a static agent tool allowlist — the
last invisible at the runner layer, so no fail-closed downgrade condition
exists), and the leaked block may be untrusted external content the model
merely reproduced. So the leaked turn is marked un-landed and the user gets a
visible card; nothing is queued and nothing can execute.

These tests exercise the pure detector (``has_leaked_tool_call``) and the
gating decision (``should_notice_leaked_tool_call``) directly, matching the
sibling promise-only suite.

The machine-syntax fixtures are ASSEMBLED from fragments rather than written
as literals: a raw invoke block in this file is exactly the byte sequence
agent tool-call parsers trip over (the defect under test), so spelling it out
verbatim makes the file itself hazardous to quote.
