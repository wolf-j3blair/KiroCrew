"""Tests for the crew runtime — session, brief injection, nudge, watcher sweep.

Nothing here spawns a real session or touches the network: the dashboard state is a
fake that records what was asked of it, the provider client is patched, and every
store read/write is scoped to ``tmp_path``.

The coverage is weighted toward the failures that are SILENT, because a crew runs
with nobody watching:

  * **The length guard on brief injection.** A compaction summary that merely
    quotes the sentinel is the failure mode that matters: a sentinel-only check
    reads it as a hit and the crew spends the rest of the day running on a
    paraphrase of its own instructions, with no error anywhere. So the guard has a
    test of its own, and it is one of the two tests falsified below.
  * **Trust.** Granting it to an attended crew is an unattended-tool-execution
    bug; failing to re-establish it for an unattended one parks the crew in an
    approval prompt for two hours and then denies it.
  * **First observation.** A cold fingerprint must report NOTHING, or every
    gateway restart wakes every crew on every open item at once.
  * **Each of the six signals.** Missing one means an item stalls forever with no
    trace, which is exactly what the sweep exists to prevent.

    """The two shape rules that make the wake's liveness checks total.

    1. Every exit from the wake passes the same check, which is why it sits in a
       ``finally``: the grant is minted from a pre-``await`` record, so a path that
       returns without re-checking leaves a grant the stop path already revoked
       standing. A guard per ``return`` cannot cover the exception path, and each
       instance found in review was a ``return`` nobody had listed yet.
    2. Not one of those reads runs on the event loop. The record carries uncapped
       operator free text, so a synchronous read of it is an unbounded blocking call
       on the gateway's only thread — the ``no-blocking-call-on-event-loop`` hazard.
       Correctness does not need it: :func:`crew_runtime.wake_crew` documents why the
       read's own thread hop cannot hide a stop, since every stop path writes the
       record before it revokes.

    Pinned on the code's SHAPE because that is what regresses: an added ``return``,
    or a read quietly taken on the loop to make a check "tighter", cannot be observed
