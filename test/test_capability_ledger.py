"""The capability ledger: every TransportCapabilities field is classified.

``TransportCapabilities`` drifted into being false documentation: flags were
declared, docstrings described gates, and nothing read most of the fields.
7 of 9 flags have ZERO read sites, five channel
declarations are provably wrong against their own code, and one docstring
promises a ``max_buttons`` degradation no renderer implements.

This module is the ratchet against that recurring. Two rules:

1. Every field is either ENFORCED (something behaves differently) or
   ASPIRATIONAL (declared honestly, consumed by nothing yet). Adding a field
   without classifying it here fails the mirror test.
2. A field moving from ASPIRATIONAL to ENFORCED must move sets here in the
   same change, so the ledger stays the map of what a declaration actually
   buys.

The declaration pins below assert the CORRECTED values, with each correction's
reason inline — they are honesty regressions, not tautologies.

    # legs (dashboard/chat_runner.py, slack/gateway.py's subagent reply ladder)

    # construction: a byte-capped transport that declares it gets fence-aware
    # byte splitting, and one that does not keeps the 4x-pessimistic char floor.
    "max_message_bytes",
    # Gates mirror-link creation (HTTP 400) and the outbound mirror leg.
    "supports_proactive_send",
    # Gates whether a dashboard connect marks the binding as an inbound resume

    # whether the slot row reports ``direction: both``. Only a transport whose
    # inbound path resolves the mirror binding may declare it.

    # no widget (trailer stripped; their text fallback is the
    # approval-ladder work).
    "max_buttons",
    # Gates whether a renderer extracts local image references out of a sealed
    # segment and uploads them (discord/renderer.py::_uploads_enabled ->
    # client.send_message_with_files). A channel declaring False keeps printing
    # the markdown path, which is the honest degradation -- never a silent drop.

    # addresses and the defang makes every address uncopyable.
    "mention_grammars",
    # Gates whether a renderer attaches an Adaptive Card at all
    # (webex/renderer.py::_options_card and ::on_prompt_choice). A channel

    "rich_blocks",

    # declaring False cannot reach messaging.attachments.ingest, so it has no
    # IngestResult to carry a rejection and the sender would be left unable to
