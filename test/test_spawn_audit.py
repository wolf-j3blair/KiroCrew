"""Subprocess-spawn audit — security-review finding 92e24570.

Every subprocess spawn in ``src/kiro_crew`` must be either

* routed through the sandbox chokepoint (its enclosing function calls
  ``sandboxed_spawn_argv``, ``wrap_argv``, or the regression-pinned async
  adapter around ``sandboxed_spawn_argv``), so the spawned process gets
  OS-level filesystem isolation and a credential-scrubbed environment, or
* explicitly listed in ``BENIGN_SPAWNS`` below as a spawn whose command,
  arguments, and working directory are NOT agent-influenced.

This test is a regression tripwire: adding a NEW unrouted spawn makes it fail
until the author either routes the spawn through the chokepoint or, having
confirmed the command is not agent-influenced, adds its ``file::function`` key
to ``BENIGN_SPAWNS`` with a justification. This is the "lint or unit test
asserting every subprocess spawn is either allow-listed as benign or routed
through that wrapper" the finding asks for.

The agent-influenced sites — the MCP server probe
(``mcp_discovery.probe_server``), the TaskRunner test command
(``task_executor.run_tests``), TaskRunner git operations
(``git_coord._git`` / ``_is_git_repo``), and authenticated source-provider
fetches (``source_providers._run_json``) — are routed through
``sandboxed_spawn_argv`` and MUST stay routed (see
``test_agent_influenced_sites_are_routed``).

The remaining unrouted spawns below are pre-existing and fall into these
groups, none of which is the finding's agent-influenced-spawn vector:

* Operator-invoked CLI / setup / doctor / self-update (fixed argv against our
  own install: git pull, pip, npm, kiro-cli/kirocrew update,
  systemctl/launchctl, node/ollama bootstrap).
* Internal process management (read our own ppid; enumerate/kill our own
  managed/orphaned processes) and system-metrics probes (fixed sysctl/ps/etc).
* Trusted-side gateway/MCP-backend spawns (``mcp_gateway`` — MCP backends sit
  on the trusted side of the sandbox boundary by design) and the Playwright CLI
  toolchain spawns in ``browser_cli`` (fixed argv, operator-triggered install;
  the agent's own browser commands are shell tool calls gated by the approval
  path, not spawns we make).
* Operator-configured state sync (``sync/*`` — git/s3/rsync/litestream
  push/pull against an operator-set remote) and app-registry package install
  of an operator-installed package.

FOLLOW-UP HARDENING CANDIDATES (defense-in-depth, NOT this finding, tracked for
a later pass — they are allowlisted here because their repo/remote is
operator-configured rather than agent-selected in the finding's sense):
``apps/builtins/code_reviewer/git.py`` git against a locally-checked-out CR
repo, and ``sync/*`` push/pull. Routing these would also need their real-git
unit tests to tolerate the sandbox wrapper.

The Design Tweak builtin (``apps/builtins/design_tweak/backend/server.py``)
adds three spawns in the same non-agent-selected categories:
``_lsof_fields`` (fixed-argv ``lsof`` on numeric pids the backend discovered —
a system probe like the sysctl/ps ones above), ``_h_pick_folder`` (fixed-argv
``osascript`` running a hardcoded AppleScript for the macOS folder picker — a
desktop-UI spawn), and ``_start_dev_proc`` (the user's OWN registered project
dev server: cwd is the user-selected project dir and the argv is that project's
package-manager dev script — operator/user-configured, reached only via the
HMAC-signed gateway proxy, not agent-prompt-selected). ``_start_dev_proc`` is
directly analogous to ``code_reviewer/git.py`` and is a follow-up sandbox-routing
candidate; routing a long-lived dev server would need the resource/filesystem
wrapper not to starve it.

OUT OF SCOPE BY SHAPE: a skill's own helper scripts, under ``builtin_skills/**``
or ``apps/builtins/<app>/skills/**`` (see ``_is_bundled_skill_asset``). These are
scripts an agent runs in a shell, gated by the shell approval path, not
subprocesses this package spawns; the gateway neither imports them (pinned by
``test_bundled_skill_assets_are_not_imported``) nor execs them (such an exec
would be a spawn site in a non-exempt file, reviewed there).
