"""Per-session mounting of the dashboard session-control server for crew members.

Pins the four seams the member-dispatch mount rides on:

- ``members.member_dispatch_session_server`` — the session-level ``mcpServers``
  element, carrying strict identity via ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` in its env
  plus the gateway's bound port and its ``KIROCREW_HOME`` override, both of
  which the from-scratch env would otherwise drop.
- ``kas_agents.to_client_custom_agent(member_dispatch=True)`` — the KAS wire
  projection widening: the server joins ``tools`` and the conductor's
  approval-free dashboard verbs join the ``allowedTools`` input BEFORE the
  governance ceiling filter.
- ``AcpClient._append_member_dispatch_server`` — the claude session-array append,
  honoring the permission-surface precondition.
- ``AcpProvider._member_session_key`` — the set membership that decides whether the
  runtime's session/new and session/load paths mount anything at all, which is the
  only route a codex member session has.
- ``AcpRuntime._kas_custom_agents`` / ``create_session`` threading — the member
  flag reaches the projection.

The mount is deliberately session-scoped: every test here also pins the
negative (a non-member session gains nothing), because THAT is the property the
per-session design exists for — mounting through the on-disk template would
hand session control to every session of the agent.
