"""Every protected name is held for the namespace lifetime, not sampled at spawn.

A mask over a DIRECTORY holds every name inside it, present and future: the
sandbox resolves those names inside the stand-in the launcher created, so a
host-side republish of any of them never appears in that namespace.

A mask over a leaf NAME holds only the object it covers. The name's parent stays
live, so an atomic replace of that name by a host-side writer -- a Dev Fleet
cutover, a config save -- puts a fresh, writable object at a protected name while
the mask hangs off the object that was there at spawn.

These tests enumerate the protected names FROM SOURCE for every tier and pin
which of the two holds each name has. They are static: no namespace, no mount,
no privilege.

POSIX only, and the reason is the legitimate one rather than convenience: the
launcher mask mechanism does not exist on Windows, where the wrap is skipped
entirely, so the invariant asserted here has no subject on that platform. The
skip would be hollow the other way round -- if Windows were itself the behaviour
under test -- but here running on Windows would assert nothing and crash doing
it, because the launcher builder reads ``os.getuid``.

    #:   ``crew-panels`` and ``crew-teams`` rather than under ``trust/``, which

    #:   a runtime-built path. Same hold as those two, and the same reason it can
    #:   only be leaf-only.
    #: * ``config.json`` / ``config.local.json`` -- the owner's settings files,
    #:   sealed read-only so an agent cannot loosen its own settings. Both sit
    #:   at the data-home root, so two leaves are six entries per tier.
    #: * ``vouched-executions`` -- the gateway's restart-surviving vouches for
    #:   member-store admission. A forged file would admit a session to a peer
    #:   member's private memory, so it sits at the root, masked, rather than

    #: Two directories hold what the MCP gateway launches outside the sandbox,
    #: six entries per tier. ``mcp-launch-approvals`` holds the owner's approved
    #: launch fingerprints; ``mcp/resolved`` holds executables substituted for an

    #:
    #: Two more landed with the app contribution protocol, both at the data-home

    #: directory, because it is what bounds that app -- so leaf-only is again the
    #: only hold available, and 2 x 3 spellings is a further +6 per tier:
    #:
    #: * ``app-unit-approvals.json`` -- the operator's per-app unit-kind
