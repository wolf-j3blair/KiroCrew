"""The held no-follow chain walk.

Both routes are exercised here on one host. The walk itself is ordinary Python over
two platform primitives, so the by-name route is testable wherever those primitives
answer -- and on POSIX they do: ``open_entry_no_follow`` opens with ``O_NOFOLLOW`` and
a symlink is refused at the open with ``ELOOP`` rather than classified. What is NOT testable off Windows is the
guarantee the held descriptors buy, because a handle that denies ``FILE_SHARE_DELETE``
is the mechanism blocking the rename a swap needs. The Windows CI shard covers that;
what these tests pin is the walk's verdict for every state a component can be in, and
that each verdict is reached without following anything.
