"""Post-compaction continuation: the fix for a chat that hangs after "Compacting...".

Three layers are covered, in the order the signal travels:

1. ``parse_claude_compaction_notice`` -- the ACP-layer translation of the
   claude-agent-acp adapter's plain-text compaction notices into the same
   ``EVENT_COMPACTION_STATUS`` vocabulary kiro-cli and KAS already produce. The
   adapter emits them as ordinary ``agent_message_chunk`` text, indistinguishable
   from model prose to any ACP client, so exact-literal matching is the whole
   contract and drift in either direction is what these tests pin.
2. ``AcpClient._settle_claude_compaction`` -- an AUTOMATIC mid-turn compaction
   sends the ``started`` notice and then no terminal at all (the adapter emits
   "Compacting completed." only from the SDK's ``compact_result`` status, which
   is the MANUAL ``/compact`` signal; the automatic path takes ``compact_boundary``
   and emits only a usage update). Without a synthesized terminal the compacting
   UI state never closes and the context meter never resets.
3. ``should_continue_after_compaction`` -- the dashboard's decision to inject one
   continuation. Every gate here exists to stop a synthetic prompt from
   overriding something the user did, so each is tested for the NEGATIVE.
4. The never-delete-a-chunk invariant -- recognizing a notice is a GUESS about
   bare prose, so no layer may drop the chunk on the strength of it. The chunk is
   forwarded and FLAGGED (``AcpEvent.control_notice``) so a consumer can show it
   without counting it as the turn's answer. Recognition stays in the ACP layer;
   the dashboard reads one flag and never re-parses. That bounds a
   misclassification to a redundant compaction indicator rather than deleted
   assistant output -- and keeps a notice from shadowing the continuation branch.
