"""The gate the real-adapter contract tests stand on, and the versions they measured.

A test that measures a real adapter has two audiences with opposite needs. A
developer without the adapter installed needs it to skip. The CI lane that exists
to run it needs an absent adapter to be RED, because a lane whose only guard
skipped asserted nothing while reporting success -- which is the whole reason a
skip-only guard is worth replacing.

``KIROCREW_E2E_REQUIRE=1`` separates them, and it is deliberately the switch this
repository already has rather than a second spelling of it:
``test/e2e/scenarios/conftest.py`` reads the same name for the same contract ("skip
on a missing precondition, or FAIL when the job declared the precondition must
hold"), as do the Playwright gate and the gateway-boot matrix. The name says E2E
and this lane is not E2E, but one name for one mechanism is the property worth
keeping: a job sets it for its own module set, and here that set is the guarded
contract tests. Unset, which is every local run, an absent adapter skips exactly as
a ``skipif`` did.

The flag is not the only thing holding the rule. The lane also asserts on its junit
report that no selected case was skipped, so a run where the variable never arrived
cannot pass by skipping -- and every guarded test carries the ``real_adapter``
marker the lane selects on, so a new one is picked up rather than silently left out.

The versions are the pins, and they live in ONE place: ``test/real_adapters/``
holds a small npm manifest with an exact version per adapter and its lockfile. The
lane runs ``npm ci`` there, so what it installs is the whole locked tree --
top-level and transitive -- and a cache miss cannot change what is measured. This
module reads the manifest so the tests and the lane cannot disagree about which
release the assertions were measured against, and the lane asserts the installed
package against the same number.

A bump arrives as its own pull request: Dependabot refreshes that manifest weekly,
and THAT PR's run of the lane is where adapter drift shows up -- red in a change
that carries nothing but the new release, where the answer is to re-measure and
adjust the assertions, never to relax one to match whatever the new tree does. To
bump by hand: edit the exact version, run ``npm install --package-lock-only`` in
that directory, and commit both files.

ONE contract this lane cannot measure, which a codex-acp bump therefore has to cover
by hand: whether ``session/close`` leaves the Codex thread LOADABLE. This lane's
credential is fabricated, and ``session/load`` on a thread that never ran a real turn
is refused -- "no rollout found for thread id", measured -- so the property is not
assertable here however the test is written. Where it IS asserted is
``test_codex_session_mcp.py::test_real_codex_acp_load_after_close_restores``, which
prompts and so runs only under ``KIROCREW_LIVE_CODEX_PROMPT_TESTS=1`` on a host holding
a codex credential. codex's membership in ``ACP_BACKENDS_SESSION_SHARING`` rests on that
property, so a codex-acp bump needs one credentialled run of that test beside this
lane's green; this lane going green alone does not establish it.
