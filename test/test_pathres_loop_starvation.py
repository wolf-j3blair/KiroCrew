"""The event loop must not queue behind bulk path resolution on ``mc-pathres``.

Field report (Amazon Linux 2, 0.6.0.16): eight of eight loop-stall crash dumps
showed the loop thread parked in ``Future.result`` inside
``is_sensitive_path`` -> ``_run_resolution_bounded``, reached from
``recycle_background -> acp_effective_model -> _resolve_named_agent_model ->
_read_agent_spec`` -- while two to four worker threads sat in
``skills._iter_skill_files`` submitting one resolution per directory and per
``SKILL.md`` to the same two-worker FIFO pool. No single wait crossed the 2 s
budget, so the stall breaker never tripped; the loop's waits simply queued
behind the scanner's backlog, and their sum crossed the watchdog. Queueing, not
a slow disk: ~1.4k sub-2 ms ``realpath`` calls per scan.

These tests pin the two halves of the fix:

- the skill walk asks the fence LEXICALLY against the ``realpath`` it already
  computed (``is_sensitive_resolved_path``), with the anchors resolved inline on
  its own thread, so it submits nothing to the pool on either half while the
  fence's decision -- same targets, same cache -- is unchanged;
- the named-agent model resolver reads the ``parsed_agent_specs`` snapshot, so a
  warm call on the loop re-parses (and re-resolves) nothing and a cold call
  touches no file at all; the one caller that reaches it cold, the background
  session's creation, warms the snapshot off the loop first.
