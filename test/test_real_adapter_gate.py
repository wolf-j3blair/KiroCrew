"""The gate that stops a real-adapter lane from passing on a skip.

``real_adapter_gate`` exists for one outcome: a lane that installs an adapter in
order to measure it must go RED when the adapter is missing, while the same test on
a developer's box still skips. That is one branch in each direction, and the branch
nobody exercises by accident is the failing one -- so it is pinned here.

The rest of this file is the part the lane cannot check about itself. The lane
selects tests by the ``real_adapter`` marker and collects two FILES, so three things
have to hold for "no contract goes unrun" to stay true: every test that consults the
gate carries the marker, every FILE that consults the gate is in the lane's
collection scope, and the pins the lane installs are the ones these tests measured.
Each is read off the tree and the workflow here, where a violation is one red test
rather than a silently narrower lane.
