"""A wave digest must fire exactly once, even around done-but-unreported members.

``batch_members_pending()`` stops counting a member the moment ``info.done``
flips, but that member's contribution to the consumer's ``bp["done"]`` only
lands when its (shielded, possibly slow) terminal report actually reaches the
completion consumer. In that window a SIBLING completion sees
``done < total`` with no pending members, so the last-member fallback
finalized the wave early — and the in-flight report then re-created the
batch-progress record via ``setdefault`` and finalized the same wave a second
time. Reachable with two RUNNING members alone: member A
done-but-unreported while member B's report executes the consumer.

The fix holds the fallback open while ``batch_reports_in_flight()`` — any
registered member with ``done`` flipped whose report has not yet been consumed
— and the consumer clears the flag in the same synchronous block that lands
the done-count, so the flag and the count can never be observed apart.

These tests drive the REAL ``_subagent_done`` closure (captured from
``_init_subagents`` exactly like the cron-injection suite) with a scripted
manager, so the race window is deterministic instead of a timing lottery.
