"""Tests for the manual goal-loop trigger.

The gap these pin: the loop interval is an IDLE gap, so an operator who already
knows the thing being waited on has changed had no way to tell the loop to look
now. There was no out-of-band fire anywhere on the surface — the autonudge HTTP
API was list / get / start / update / delete, and no MCP tool fired either.

Two properties matter more than the button, and both are asserted here rather
than described in prose:

* **The schedule.** A manual fire must not silently shift the interval. It does
  not, and the reason is that it reuses the delivered-fire bookkeeping: a
  delivered cycle clears ``next_due_ts`` and the re-arm then starts a fresh full
  interval, so the next automatic nudge lands one ``idle_secs`` after the manual
  turn ENDS. Pinned by
  ``test_the_next_automatic_nudge_is_a_full_interval_after_the_manual_turn_ends``.
* **The bounds.** A manual press must not buy a turn past a bound the user
  armed. ``fire_now`` arms the ordinary ``_timer`` body rather than calling
  ``_run_fire_cycle`` directly, so every terminal gate still runs. Pinned per
  gate — the cycle cap and the stop sentinel each get their own test, because a
  single test would only be proven to the first gate that fires.

The refusals are pinned too, and the mid-fire one is load-bearing rather than
defensive: ``_arm_timer`` cancels the existing timer task, and inside the fire
window that task may be parked on ``_persist_locked()`` writing the delivered
cycle.
