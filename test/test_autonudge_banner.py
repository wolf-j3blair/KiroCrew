"""Tests for the optional per-loop ``banner`` on auto-nudge.

A nudge loop's ``message`` serves two consumers with opposite needs. The model
needs the whole instruction re-delivered on every cycle — that is the guarantee
the nudge exists to provide. A person reading the transcript needs only "a nudge
happened", and today gets the same multi-KB payload appended per cycle: measured
on one long-running loop, 44 nudge rows of ~7.9KB were 51.8% of the entire
671,900-char session file.

``banner`` lets a loop opt into a short visible row while the prompt stays whole.

Two properties carry the change, and the FIRST is the acceptance bar:

1. **Default byte-identity.** A loop with no banner must append exactly the row
   it appended before this feature existed. Every armed loop in the fleet
   depends on that, and the feature is worthless if buying it costs a behaviour
   change for loops that never asked for it.
2. **Divergence proved at the PROMPT.** The whole point is that the row and the
   prompt differ, so a test asserting only on the row would pass just as well if
   the prompt had ALSO been shortened — which is precisely the defect this must
   not introduce. Every banner test therefore asserts on the argument handed to
   ``_run_chat``, not merely on ``slot.append``.

    The store is not one of those paths — ``autonudge.json`` is a file an agent
    can write directly — and ``_load`` is the only other way a banner reaches
    memory, so an unbounded value gets in with no bound applied anywhere.

    That matters because the banner is then scanned synchronously: ``_load``
    itself runs both redactors over it, and the fire path runs
    ``render_nudge_message`` plus the same two passes on every cycle. Those scans
    are linear in the banner's length, and nothing else bounds it.

    Treated as ABSENT rather than truncated, matching this loader's existing
    convention for an invalid persisted value: the sibling non-string arm sets
    ``""`` and marks the store dirty, and ``repair_sentinel_path`` does the same.
    Truncating would invent a banner the operator never wrote.
