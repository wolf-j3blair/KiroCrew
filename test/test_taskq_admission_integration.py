#: dev Linux box drains the whole set in ~18 s, the same box with its core
#: contended took ~4.4 minutes, and the rate a Windows shard measured (648 rows in
#: 60 s) puts the set near 3 minutes there. Sized well above the slowest of those
#: because a host slower still is a slow host, not a broken queue -- a queue that
#: has genuinely stopped is caught sooner and far more cheaply by
#: :data:`_STALLED_PASSES`. Deliberately BELOW the per-test timeout the drain
#: test's marker raises, with room to spare for the submission phase this does NOT
#: wrap, so reaching it fails as an assertion naming the state counts rather than
#: as a killed xdist worker -- on Windows pytest-timeout has no SIGALRM and takes
#: the whole worker with it.

    minutes on the same box with its core contended.

    Two independent bounds, and which one fires names the failure. A queue that has
    stopped moving returns after :data:`_STALLED_PASSES` idle passes, and the
    state-count assertion below reports what was left -- that is the fast signal,
    and it is the one a real defect trips. Only a host still making progress
    reaches :data:`_DRAIN_CEILING_SECS`, which raises those same counts as an
    assertion rather than a bare ``TimeoutError``.

    So the ceiling is a backstop on WALL TIME, not a poll count raised until a
    race stops firing: it wraps no assertion, so no value of it can make a wrong
    answer pass -- it can only stop a slow-but-correct host from being reported as
    a broken queue. The marker sits above the ceiling plus the submission phase,

    reports nothing and no second claimer can, which is strictly more harm than
    the outage this guards. ``ValueError`` stands for the class no arm names on
