"""``~/.ssh`` is withheld from agent subprocesses on a push-verdict-activated install.

An activated push-verdict installation judges the agent's own visible ``git push`` at the argv
floor, but an opaque subprocess (an interpreter shelling out to git from compiled code) presents
no publish source for the floor to judge. Outside the strict tier ``~/.ssh`` is otherwise
readable, so that subprocess authenticates over SSH and lands a commit the gate never saw.

On LINUX the launcher therefore hides ``~/.ssh`` (and the HTTPS credential stores, the ssh-agent
and D-Bus sockets) from every agent-tier spawn once gating is activated -- keeping
``~/.ssh/known_hosts`` so legitimate host verification still works -- while the one gateway-owned
publish path stays exempt (``gateway_publish=True``) and keeps its access.

On macOS push-verdict activation is NOT supported: the agent child's git credential lives in the
OS keychain, which no Seatbelt rule can withhold from the child without also severing the agent's
own keychain sign-in and Security.framework TLS. So an activated agent spawn FAILS CLOSED (raises
``SandboxCeilingUnsealable``) rather than shipping a mask the child can defeat; the gateway-owned
publish stays exempt and builds a profile as on Linux. A non-activated install is unchanged on
both platforms: the agent keeps ``~/.ssh``.

Every negative assertion (the mask is NOT applied) is paired with a positive control taken the
same way, so a mask that silently stopped applying could not pass as "not activated".
