"""Session control: one chat session sending to, stopping, and reading another.

The suite is organized around the two things that can go wrong here. First,
authorization: every refusal is asserted against the REAL slot objects, because
the guards read ``memory_mode`` / ``workspace`` / ``_app`` off the production
class and a permissive test double would let a dead guard look alive. Second,
delivery: a message must land exactly once — the interesting failures are the
double-delivery and silent-drop paths around a steer that the live client
refuses mid-flight.

    """``agent.session_control`` defaults ON; the agent config is the real grant.

    Who may reach a peer session is decided by the AGENT CONFIG, not by this
    switch: the tools come from the `kirocrew-dashboard` MCP server, so an agent
    that does not mount it never has them -- the same rule as every other MCP
    server. A second default-off gate on top of that only made the capability
    unreachable for an agent whose spec had already been given it deliberately.

    What the switch is still for is a single withdrawal: an operator who wants it
    gone from every agent at once, without editing each spec. So the one direction
    that must keep working is an EXPLICIT ``false``:

    * **Absent.** Both the ``.get`` default and the dataclass field default are
      ``True``, so a mounted server works with nothing else written down.
    * **Malformed.** ``bool("false")`` is ``True``, so a plain coercion loads a
      quoted opt-out as ENABLED and a user who wrote it in an editor that quotes
      values would keep cross-session control on while believing it off.
      ``_safe_bool`` accepts only a real bool.

    Asserted on the source rather than through ``KiroCrewConfig.load()``:
    ``load()`` merges the real data home's ``config.local.json`` and serves a
    fingerprint-cached dict, so a per-field assertion through it depends on the
    developer's own config rather than on the payload under test. The parse is
