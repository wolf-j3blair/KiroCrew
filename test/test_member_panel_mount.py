"""Pins the seams the crew-panel member mount rides on.

The sibling of ``test_member_dispatch_mount.py``, and the same five seams:

- ``members.member_panel_session_server`` -- the session-level ``mcpServers``
  element, carrying strict identity via ``KIROCREW_SESSION_KEY`` plus the
  gateway's bound port, through the one writer both member mounts share.
- ``kas_agents.to_client_custom_agent(crew_panel=True)`` -- the KAS wire
  projection widening: the server joins ``tools`` and the panel verbs join the
  ``allowedTools`` input BEFORE the governance ceiling filter.
- ``AcpClient._append_member_panel_server`` -- the claude session-array append,
  honoring the array-level preconditions its dispatch sibling documents.
- ``members.crew_panel_enabled`` -- the operator ceiling, fail-closed.
- the premise: ``kirocrew-panel`` is ``opt_in``, so no spec emits it and this
  mount is the only path to it.

Every branch is pinned in both directions, because the negative is what the
per-session design exists for: mounting through the on-disk template would hand
a panel to every session of the agent.
