"""Liveness tests for the shell-command gate.

``is_sensitive_bash_command`` runs synchronously on the gateway's event loop,
under a loop-stall watchdog that hard-exits the process after 25 s of silence
(``dashboard.loop_stall_exit_after_secs``). Path-matching passes over the command
are quadratic, so a ~9 KB command full of ``https://`` URLs can stall the loop
past that budget. The gate does not match paths in command text at all -- and
what it still runs
(the size ceiling, the IMDS detector and the environment-credential detector) is
pinned here at the crash size, under the ceiling, where it is what the loop
actually pays. The ceiling itself is pinned as a refusal, not a skip: a command
too long to scan is denied rather than let through unscanned.

# Package shape: the split must not grow back into a monolith
# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────


#: Ceiling on the whole security PACKAGE, not on any one file in it. The controls
#: were one module of about 21,800 lines, and the split adds a re-export block, an
#: export manifest and the mirroring facade on top of the code it relocates, so the
#: budget is that size plus room for the machinery, plus the redaction record,
#: credential-source and allowed-host modules, plus the resolver child script
#: (``_child_realpath.py``, ~190 lines) that lives beside the resolver it serves
#: rather than in the pool package. It is a bound on total volume:
#: relocating a declaration between submodules moves nothing across it.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,200, when the facade stopped binding re-exported names
#: eagerly and began resolving each through its owner. That trades one import block
#: for two name lists -- an owner table and a ``TYPE_CHECKING`` block, one line per
#: exported name in each -- which measured 618 lines at the current surface and is
#: machinery, not control logic.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,751, for the write-protected home entries covering the MCP
#: launch-approval directory and ``mcp/resolved``: gatewayd spawns an approved stub's
#: backend outside the sandbox, so a session must not be able to write either path.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,761, for the ssh self-target refusal note: it says how long
#: a retry can still land inside the background check and names the IP-literal case
#: where this machine's address list cannot be read, so a refused agent knows when
#: to stop retrying and what to use instead.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,766, for the write-protected home entry covering the kiro-cli
#: global MCP registry (``~/.kiro/settings/mcp.json``) and its ``KIRO_HOME``
#: re-anchoring: an ``autoApprove`` on an entry there is honoured by default and skips
#: the tool gate entirely, while the entry that decides it is admitted on its name
#: shape rather than on who wrote the file -- so an agent-writable registry grants its
#: own verbs a standing bypass. The reasoning for one leaf is most of the cost, which
#: is the shape every entry on this tier has.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,814, for resolving the ``$HOME``-rooted form of both kiro-cli
#: write-tier leaves rather than only their ``KIRO_HOME`` copies. Anchoring them
#: lexically covered a symlinked ``$HOME`` itself but not one further down the path, so
#: a dotfile-managed ``~/.kiro`` left the real spec dir and the real MCP registry outside
#: the fence while their ``~``-spelled paths stayed inside it. The cost is the reasoning
#: plus one shared tuple, which is what replaces a second per-leaf arm.
#:
#: Lowered to 27,851 by SUBTRACTION. An earlier revision of this branch also emitted
#: every kiro-cli target in a second, all-forward-slash spelling, on the premise that a
#: Windows root could reach the anchor builder carrying the operator's own separators.
#: That premise is false: every root arrives through ``_resolve_root_anchors``, which
#: returns ``_realpath_or_none(expanded) or _lexical_root(expanded)``, and both answer
#: in the native spelling -- ``_lexical_root``'s ``os.path.normpath`` converts
#: ``C:/Users/x`` to ``C:\Users\x``. With no input that fails without it, the second
#: spelling was decoration, and on POSIX it would fence a bogus neighbour for any file
#: whose name contains a backslash. It is removed together with the two tests that
#: existed only for it; the ``$HOME``-symlink coverage passes without it, which is what
#: shows it was never load-bearing.
#:
#: Raised again, from 27,851, because the ``KIRO_HOME`` half was two hardcoded
#: per-leaf arms while the ``$HOME`` half looped the tuple -- so the tuple's own
#: comment ("a third leaf joins both halves by landing here") was false, and a third
#: leaf would have been fenced under ``$HOME`` and writable under the override. Both
#: halves now loop the same tuple, each leaf's tail is spelled once, and a test adds a
#: probe leaf and asserts BOTH spellings refuse -- it fails on the old code.
#:
#: Re-pinned again, on top of every raise above, for the ``panel-dismissals`` leaf
#: added to ``_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`` in ``paths.py``: one entry plus the comment
#: stating why nothing a run can reach may forge or delete the operator's dismissal
#: records. Ten lines, all of them the fence declaration and its reason -- no new
#: control logic and no new matching pass. This branch's raise and the ones above it
#: are independent additions to the same ratchet, so the number below is re-MEASURED
#: off the tree rather than being the arithmetic sum of the deltas.
#: Raised again, from 27,863, for the own-address startup warm in ``argv_floor``:
#: the gateway starts the netlink read at boot, the worker reads and publishes that
#: table before any DNS lookup, and the publish merges the addresses and opens the
#: IP-literal window in one lock hold while each check reads the window flag before
#: the names, so the first ssh after a restart is not refused as this machine and a
#: secondary own IP is never admitted mid-publish. A dump that ends without
#: NLMSG_DONE, or that the kernel flags NLM_F_DUMP_INTR, counts as unread, so a
#: partial table never opens the window. So does an NLMSG_DONE whose errno is not 0.
#: Three incomplete dumps in a row log one warning, so a host whose table never
#: reads can be told apart from a target that is really this machine.
#:
#: Re-pinned from 27,942 for the NUL blanking in ``inline_payload._lex``: one line
#: that swaps each NUL for a space before tokenizing, plus the docstring saying why.
#: CPython 3.12 raises ``SystemError`` for a NUL after an indented block, which
#: escaped the lexer and crashed the gate on an ordinary ``b'\0'`` in a payload.
#: No new rule and no new matching pass.
#: Raised again, from 27,948, by one line: the ``vouched-executions`` entry in
#: ``_SENSITIVE_HOME_DIRS``. Each file there is the gateway's restart-surviving
#: word that a session may reach its member's private store, so no file tool may
#: write it. The fuller reason lives beside its ``sandbox._CREW_HIDDEN_LEAVES`` mask.
#:
#: Re-pinned from 27,949 for ``redaction._DOCUMENT_LINK_RE``: pass 3 skips a run
#: wholly inside a Google Docs, Drive or Confluence link of a fixed route, because a
#: document id is the same random base64 a key is and no gate can split the two.
#: One route regex, one span helper, a four-line check in pass 3, and the comment
#: naming the residual. No pass widened and no threshold moved.
#:
#: Raised again, from 28,025, for the ssh self-target floor's boot-time warm-up: the
#: own-address table is read at gateway startup and published before the DNS
#: lookups, and background threads parse the hosts-file table (in bounded chunks,
#: keyed on the own-address set it was judged by). On a miss the gate path parses
#: only a file that fits in one read chunk; a larger file is refused as pending
#: until the background parse is cached. On Windows, where ``st_ctime`` is creation
#: time, the key also carries a content digest (``hosts_file.py``, which holds the
#: line parser and digest helpers apart from ``argv_floor``'s per-module cap). A
#: Windows file too large to hash on the gate is never served, so a dotless target
#: there is pending, and the ssh self-target refusal note says so.
#:
#: Raised again, from 28,399, by two lines: case (1) of the ssh self-target refusal
#: note names a dotless target refused while a hosts file over 64 KiB is still read
#: in the background, so a caller retries it rather than treating it as settled.
#:
#: Raised again, from 28,401, for the containment gate's ``pre_resolved`` keyword:
#: one keyword on ``path_contains_sensitive``, forwarded to the two helpers that
#: already take it, plus the preconditions it carries written on the keyword
#: itself. The claim is ``is_sensitive_resolved_path``'s, unchanged: the caller
#: holds the canonical spelling and is off the event loop, so the anchors resolve
#: inline. No new entry point, no target, no matching rule and no threshold moved.
#:
#: Raised again for the ``app-unit-approvals.json`` protected-path
#: entry in ``paths.py`` (the app contribution protocol). That file is the only
#: thing between an app's declared unit contributions and read/append access to a
#: crew member's whole log -- the runtime intersects the declaration with it -- so a
#: session must not be able to write it; the twelve lines are the ``_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES``
#: entry and its rationale, not control logic that belongs elsewhere.
#:
#: The number IS the package's measured total, carrying no spare room: a ratchet with
#: headroom admits exactly the unreviewed growth it exists to catch, so the next line
#: added here fails this gate and has to be re-pinned deliberately, with its reason
#: written above. The guards that detect a monolith growing back are the per-file cap
#: and the facade's share below, and both must stay untouched.
#:
#: Raised for the ``registry_trust.json`` leaf added to ``_CREW_SECRET_LEAVES`` in
#: ``paths.py``: the operator's grants of ``owner`` trust to a hand-configured app
#: registry live in a keystone file on the same read+write floor as
#: ``denied_commands.json``, so the leaf and its two-line reason are three lines the gate
#: cannot avoid.
_PACKAGE_LINE_BUDGET = 28_427

#: Ceiling on any ONE file in the package. This is what the bound is really for --
#: a package total says nothing about a single file growing back into a second
#: monolith, and a per-file cap is what a whole-file bound on the pre-split module
#: could not express. Set with headroom over the largest cluster so ordinary growth
#: does not trip it; a cluster that reaches it is asking to be split, and RAISING
#: the number is not the fix.
