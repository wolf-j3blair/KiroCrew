"""kiro_crew.messaging.approval -- both channel-neutral approval seams.

Every test here is a security property, not a convenience. The module hosts two
styles behind one INTERACTIVE decider, and this file exercises both:

* the TYPED-REPLY seam (a widget-less channel running tools at all), whose
  failure modes are all "silently approved something nobody agreed to"; and
* the WIDGET AWAITER (``PendingApprovals``), where an unanswered prompt must
  DENY and one conversation must never resolve another's prompt -- ACP request
  ids restart at 1 per session, so that is a live collision risk, not a
  theoretical one.
