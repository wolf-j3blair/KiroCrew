"""The dashboard chat path's tool-approval window.

Three properties, one per failure mode observed in production:

1. The window is CONFIGURABLE and short by default, not a literal
   ``7200.0`` in ``chat_runner`` equal to the turn ceiling.
2. It is CLAMPED below the turn ceiling. A window at or above the ceiling can
   never fire — the turn is cut first — so it is not a longer wait, it is a
   wait that never reports.
3. Its timeout says an APPROVAL went unanswered and to resend, rather than
   borrowing the generic turn-timeout wording.
