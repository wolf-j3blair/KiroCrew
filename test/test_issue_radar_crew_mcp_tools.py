"""The agent's read/write path into its own Issue Radar crew ledger.

An Issue Radar crew is an unattended agent whose context does not survive
compaction, its per-turn ceiling, or a gateway restart. The ledger does — so
these two MCP tools are the crew's memory, and every property asserted here is
load-bearing for a cold resume:

  * the ledger must be REACHABLE from an agent session, which has no dashboard
    credential (httpOnly cookie, ``KIROCREW_INTERNAL_SECRET`` stripped from agent
    env, ``.local_secret`` on the sensitive-path denylist) — hence the
    internal-secret allowlist entries, and hence a raw HTTP call earning 403;
  * a partial write must never erase what an earlier write stored, or a resume
    reads back a ledger emptier than the work it describes;
  * a phase must never move without a logged reason, which is why upsert and
    append are ONE tool;
  * the public strings must not carry this machine's identity, because the event
    log feeds a comment on github.com as well as the crew page.

#: What the read route answers with. Identity lives here and ONLY here — no tool
#: argument can select a crew — so the fixture doubles as the contract.
#:
#: The top-level ``owner``/``repo`` are the route's own echo, and they are the pair
#: that is ALWAYS present: a crew with no work items yet has no other source. The
#: copies on the crew record and the item mirror what the store holds, so this
#: fixture also covers ``_crew_identity``'s tolerance of all three locations.
#: ``test_issue_radar_crew_routes.TestAgentIdentityIsTheSession`` asserts the real

class TestAnAutoNudgeTurnResolvesTheSameIdentityAsADirectTurn:
    """The POSITIVE twin of ``test_a_subagent_resolved_identity_cannot_read_or_write``.

    The strict gate refuses a subagent because it resolves to its PARENT slot;
    that test (above, in ``TestIdentityComesFromTheSession``) pins the refusal.
    This pins the other half: an Issue Radar crew driven by an auto-nudge cycle
    is NOT a subagent -- it is the same principal, its own dashboard slot,
    re-entered on a timer -- so it must resolve to its OWN crew identity and be
    let through the gate. The crew ledger tools must not refuse an auto-nudge
    worker as "classified as a subagent". There is no such
    classification; the two turns already resolve identically. The refutation is
    "correct by construction", and this test is what keeps the construction from
    silently regressing.

    The property, not the implementation: a nudge-driven turn on a slot and a
    directly-driven turn on that same slot resolve the SAME session identity.
    Both dashboard turns run through the one ``_run_chat`` entry, which resolves
    identity as ``effective_session_key(slot)`` and hands exactly that key to
    the single shared writer ``messaging.identity.publish_turn_identity`` -- the
    mapping the strict gate later reads back. So if a future refactor of
    ``_fire_dashboard_nudge`` routed the nudge somewhere that skipped
    ``_run_chat`` (or drove it on a different session), the identity a crew tool
    resolves would diverge from a human turn's and every crew tool would start
    refusing again with that confusing message. The assertions below name the
    slot key and the writer rather than any call ordering, so they survive an
    internal rewrite that preserves the property.
