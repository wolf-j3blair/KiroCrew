"""Acceptance tests for the promise-only turn guard.

The bug: a turn that ends right after the model ANNOUNCES an immediate action
("I'll do that now") without making the tool call was recorded as a landed
success and billed, even though no work happened. The guard injects exactly one
continuation telling the model to carry out the announced action, and does not
record the promise-only turn as a success.

These tests exercise the pure detector (``is_promise_only_terminal``) and the
gating decision (``should_recover_promise_only``) directly — the two functions
that hold the logic — so they run without the chat_runner turn-loop. Each test
maps to one bullet in the issue's acceptance-coverage list.
