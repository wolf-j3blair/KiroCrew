"""Resetting a slot's conversation without destroying its record.

Resume is key-driven -- ``resume_sid = self._session_map.get(key)`` -- and a slot
key is stable by design, so reopening a slot continues the conversation it had.
That is correct for a tab the user closed and came back to, and wrong once a
long-lived conversation has drifted, filled up, or outlived the thing it was
about. Until this route existed the only way to break the link was to DELETE the
session from history, which destroys the record in order to reset the pointer.

Three things decide whether the route is correct, and each has a way of failing
silently rather than loudly:

**Which key it clears.** A slot's session is addressed by
``effective_session_key``, which prefers a channel-born slot's
``linked_session_key``. Deriving ``dashboard:<slot>`` unconditionally instead
yields a key no session ever had, so the call succeeds, reports a reset, and
clears nothing.

**Which verb it uses.** ``discard_conversation`` drops the sid and keeps the
entry, because that entry also carries the channel linkage and the reverse index
built from it. ``destroy`` would take the row with it and silently unlink a
mirrored session.

**Who may ask.** An app may reset only slots it created -- the same boundary
``api_chat_slot_delete`` draws, and for the same reason: a slot's conversation is
its own state.
