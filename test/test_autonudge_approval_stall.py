    ``start()`` publishes the service as the module singleton and only ``stop()``
    clears it, so a test that starts one and returns leaves ``get_instance()``
    handing a later test a service bound to a store it is finished with -- and the
    approval-stall hook reaches the service exactly that way, so the residue
    lands on the path under test. That is what this fixture is FOR.

    Cancelling the in-flight persists is housekeeping, not the safety property:
    it stops work nothing is waiting for. It is explicitly NOT what keeps a late
    write from landing in a deleted directory -- ``_write_state`` runs on an
    executor thread, and a thread cannot be cancelled, so no teardown inside the
    test could promise that. ``store_dir`` owns that guarantee by giving the
    store a directory no individual test deletes.

    Deliberately a SYNC fixture: this suite pins pytest-asyncio 0.20.3, whose
    async-fixture wrapper reads a ``fixturedef`` attribute pytest 8.1 removed, so
    an async-generator fixture errors at setup on CI. The repo avoids the
    decorator by convention. The unpublish is in a ``finally`` because ``stop()``
    cancels timer tasks first: if that raises against a loop already torn down,
    the singleton must still be cleared, or one failing teardown poisons every
    later test in the worker.

    ``_write_state`` opens with ``mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)``, a write
    that lands late against a per-test ``tmp_path`` re-creates a directory pytest
    already removed.

    Cancelling the task narrows that window but cannot close it, so the fix is
    not a better teardown: it is giving the store a directory no individual test
    deletes. ``tmp_path_factory`` is session-scoped, so each test still gets its
    own isolated store (no cross-test interference) while nothing is removed
    until the session ends and every task is dead. This is the same remedy the
